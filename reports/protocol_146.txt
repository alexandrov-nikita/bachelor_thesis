Searching for the item "3a Description of trial design (such as parallel, factorial) including allocation ratio"...
This part was defined, probably, at this section: 3.2. Study Design Rationale 
I found the following features of the study:
randomized
Phase 3
4 It is intercalated into the  standard MP regimen
5    therefore the same in both arm
6 weeks to other  dosing regimen
Placebo: NOT FOUND -> active-controlled study?
Allocation ratio: NOT FOUND
