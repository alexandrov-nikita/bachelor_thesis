CLINICAL TRIAL SUMMARY 

COMPOUND: Aflibercept 

TITLE 

INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 

STUDY No : EFC10547 
A Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind Study, Comparing the 
Efficacy of Aflibercept Once Every 2 Weeks versus Placebo in 
Patients Treated with Gemcitabine for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer 
Multicenter / Worldwide except Japan 
Primary objective: To demonstrate improvement in overall survival 
(OS) with aflibercept by comparison to placebo in patients treated 
with gemcitabine for metastatic pancreatic cancer. 
Secondary objectives:  
- To compare in the two treatment arms (by sequential order of 
statistical analysis): 

Progression Free Survival (PFS), 

• 
•  Clinical Benefit assessed by Time to symptoms worsening 

(TTSW) and improvement in tumor related symptoms, 

•  Overall Response Rate (ORR) in patients with measurable 

disease at study entry (as per RECIST criteria).  
- To assess the overall safety in the two treatment arms. 
- To assess immunogenicity of iv aflibercept. 
- To perform population pharmacokinetic evaluation. 
This is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, randomized (1:1), 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study comparing the 
efficacy of aflibercept in term of overall survival versus placebo 
administered on top of gemcitabine in patients with metastatic 
pancreatic cancer (MPC). 
Each patient will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or patient’s refusal. Following documentation of progressive 
disease patients will be followed-up for survival status. 
An Executive Steering Committee will be responsible for supervising 
the trial. This committee will include the Study Chairman, 2 main 
investigators and sponsor representatives. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will ensure 
patient protection with regards to the safety and will give appropriate 
recommendation to the Executive Steering Committee regarding the 
study modification, continuation or termination. The DMC will also be 
in charge of reviewing the formal statistical interim analysis of OS 
planned during the course of the study (see statistical 
considerations). 
Treatment assignment will be done centrally via an Interactive Voice 
Response System (IVRS) using a permuted-block randomization 
stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), to prior curative surgical therapy 
(pancreatectomy yes vs. no) and to geographical region. All eligible 
patients will be randomly assigned to either the control arm or the 
experimental arm in a 1:1 ratio.

PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S) AND MAIN 
SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) 

sodium chloride or 5% dextrose solution. 
For gemcitabine, see manufacturer’s product information. 
Aflibercept and placebo for aflibercept will be administered by the 
intravenous route. 
A cycle is defined as a 4-week or 28-day period in both arms. Next 
cycle is started on day 29. All cycles but first cycle include 3 
gemcitabine infusions (Day 1, 8, 15) every 4 weeks. First cycle 
includes one additional gemcitabine infusion on Day 22 and no week 
rest. 
Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Arm A or Arm B: 
•  Arm A:  

Aflibercept 4 mg/kg over 1 hour I.V. every 2 weeks. 

•  Arm B: 

Placebo over 1 hour I.V. every 2 weeks. 

Administration of investigational study drug (either aflibercept or 
placebo) will immediately be followed by gemcitabine, in both arms: 
Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV administered over 30 minutes. This 
should be repeated once weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 of cycle 1 (28-
day)  and on Days 1, 8, and 15 of subsequent 28-day cycles. 
In case of BSA > 2.1 m², the actual dose of gemcitabine should be 
adjusted to a maximum BSA of 2.1 m² for safety reasons. 
Dose reduction and/or treatment delay and/or treatment 
discontinuation are planned in case of severe toxicity. 
Primary end-point: 
- Overall Survival, defined as the time interval from the date of 
randomization to the date of death due to any cause. 
Main Secondary End-points: 
- Efficacy: 

• Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time 
interval from the date of randomization to the date of first 
observation of disease progression or the date of death (due 
to any cause), whichever comes first. 
• Clinical Benefit will be based on a composite score of pain 
severity assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), analgesic 
consumption as morphine equivalents, ECOG PS and 
weight change from baseline.  The Clinical Benefit will be 
assessed by time to symptom worsening (TTSW) evaluated 
from randomization to symptom worsening, and 
improvement in tumor related symptoms. 
• Objective responses (CR and PR) as assessed by 
investigators according to RECIST criteria (for patients with 
measurable disease at study entry). Confirmation of 
objective responses will be performed by repeating tumor 
imaging (CT scans, MRI) at least 4 weeks after the first 
radiological documentation of response. 

-Safety profile of the study treatment in terms of AEs/ SAE’s and 
laboratory parameters: 

• Type, frequency, severity, seriousness, and relatedness of 
study treatment-emergent adverse events will be assessed

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE 

according to NCI CTCAE v.3.0. 
• Laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the 
NCI CTCAE v.3.0. 

- Immunogenicity test: 

• Blood sampling for anti-aflibercept antibody detection will be 
performed prospectively at specified time points during the 
study in all patients. In addition, event-driven sampling for 
immunogenicity evaluation and pharmacokinetic 
measurement will be performed. 

- Pharmacokinetic parameters: 

• Blood sampling will be performed at specified time points 
during the study treatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
will include both free aflibercept and aflibercept:VEGF 
complex. 

Clinical examinations (including vital signs, ECOG PS) and 
laboratory safety tests (including complete blood counts, serum 
chemistries and urine analyses) will be obtained prior to each cycle 
(i.e. every 4 weeks) and at the 30-days Follow-up (FU) visit.  ECOG 
PS, vital signs assessment, hematological tests and urine analyses 
will be repeated within each cycle. 
Signs/symptoms that are present, or occurred, from the time the 
patient has signed the informed consent form to first study drug 
administration will be recorded as AEs, at cycle 1, if present at the 
time of first administration of study treatment.  SAEs will be recorded 
from the time the patient has signed the inform consent. During the 
treatment period AEs will be collected at each visit (28-day cycle) up 
to the 30-day FU visit. During the FU period (i.e. after 30-day FU 
visit), only related ongoing, or new related, AEs will be recorded. 
SAEs, regardless of relationship with study treatment, ongoing at the 
end of study treatment, will be followed during the FU period until 
resolution or stabilization. 
For all randomized and treated patients, samples for detecting anti-
aflibercept antibodies will be collected at baseline (before cycle 1), at 
through [prior to every other aflibercept/placebo infusion, i.e. 
prior to third aflibercept/placebo infusion cycle 2, fifth 
aflibercept/placebo infusion cycle 3, seventh 
aflibercept/placebo infusion cycle 4, ninth aflibercept/placebo 
infusion cycle 5, etc….], then approximately 30 days and 90 days 
after the last administered dose of aflibercept/placebo. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected at the same time 
points, with an additionnal sample at peak (end of 
aflibercept/placebo infusion 1 of cycle 1). Samples for antibody 
detection and pharmacokinetic measurement should also be 
collected in patients who develop certain adverse events. 
For all patients who are randomized at study sites equipped with 
a 4°C centrifuge (needed for preparation of the samples), one 
additional blood sample will be collected at baseline to measure 
endogenous VEGF. 
Tumor assessments (abdominal CT scan, chest X-ray or CT scan in 
case of thoracic target lesion, and any other exams as clinically 
indicated), using the same method used at baseline, will be 
performed every 8 weeks until disease progression, even if the 
patient discontinued study treatment before disease progression

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 

and/or even if the patient receive further anti-cancer therapy before 
disease progression. After disease progression is documented, 
patients will be followed every 8 weeks until death, withdrawal of 
patient consent or study cut-off date whichever comes first. Further 
anticancer treatment will be collected. 
CA19-9 evaluation will be performed at the same timepoints imaging 
is performed. CA19-9 levels will not be used for making decision on 
study treatment discontinuation. 
Statistical hypotheses and sample size calculation: 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Analysis populations: 
• 

Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population:  This population includes all 
randomized  patients who have given their informed consent. 
Patient is randomized if there is confirmation of successful 
allocation of a randomization number through the study 
treatment allocation system (IVRS). This population is the 
primary population for all efficacy parameters. All analyses 
using this population will be based on the treatment assigned by 
IVRS. 
Evaluable Patient (EP) population for tumor response: This 
population will consist of all randomized and treated patients, 
with cytologically or histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer, 
with metastatic and measurable disease at study entry, in first 
line setting and evaluable for response (i.e. patients with at 
least one tumoral evaluation while on treatment, except for early 
disease progression/cancer-related death). 
The EP for tumor response will be used for the RR analysis 
(secondary population for RR analysis, knowing that primary 
population will be ITT). All analyses using this population will be 
based on the treatment actually received. 
All-Treated (AT) population: The AT population is a subset of 
the ITT population that took at least one dose of study 
medication. This population is for safety analyses. All analyses 
using this population will be based on the treatment actually 
received. 
PK population: the PK population will include all treated patients 
with at least one PK assessment on treatment.

Primary Analysis of the primary endpoint 
OS is defined as the number of months from the date of 
randomization to the date of death. If death is not observed during 
the study, OS data will be censored at the earlier of the last date 
patient is known to be alive and the cut-off date. 
OS will be compared between the two treatments groups by the log-
rank test procedure stratified by stratification factors as specified at 
the time of randomization: ECOG PS (0 vs 1 vs 2), prior curative 
surgical therapy (pancreatectomy, yes vs no), and geographical 
region. 
The estimates of the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% 
confidence interval will be provided using a Cox proportional hazard 
model stratified by the same stratification factors as those used for 
the log-rank test described above. The survival curves will be 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. 
Interim and final analyses 
One interim analysis of OS is planned for the purpose of futility and 
overwhelming efficacy when approximately 205 OS events (40% 
information fraction) have occurred. Calculations are based on an 
O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function for efficacy boundaries and 
a gamma (-4) spending function for futility boundaries and assuming 
that the interim look will actually be carried out after the 205th event.  
The one-sided nominal significance level to consider study 
termination for overwhelming efficacy is 0.0004 at the interim 
analysis. Futility will be considered if the hazard ratio is ≥ 1.05 in 
favor of the placebo arm. 
The interim analysis will be carried out under the supervision of the 
DMC. 
The final OS analysis will be conducted when 513 deaths have been 
observed. The one-sided nominal significance level to declare 
superiority of aflibercept at the final analysis is 0.0249. 
Study treatment is intended to be administered until disease 
progression. Patients will be followed for disease progression until 
PD is documented. Patients will be followed for survival until death or 
study cut-off date, whichever comes first.

*Assessment must be performed prior to randomization rather than prior to initial dose for eligibility determination. 
a. 
b. 

Prior any protocol study procedures. 
All assessments should be performed prior to dosing with study drug unless otherwise indicated. Acceptable time windows for performing the assessments are noted below each scheduled treatment day in the Study Flowchart, 
unless otherwise noted in the footnotes below. Time between biological work-up, physical examination or clinical benefit at baseline and first infusion should not exceeds 8 days. If time exceeds 8 days, biological tests, clinical benefit 
and physical examination should be repeated prior first administration of study treatment. 

c.  Medical, Surgical and Cancer History: including cancer diagnosis (primary tumor characteristics and metastatic sites) and concurrent illness. 
d. 
e. 

Prior Anticancer Treatment: includes previous surgery for cancer, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and potential investigational antitumor therapy. 
Physical Examination: Examination of major body systems, blood pressure, height (Baseline visit only), body weight, and ECOG PS. Weight, ECOG performance status and blood pressure will be assessed prior to every study 
treatment dosing. 
Hematology: Hemoglobin, WBC, ANC, platelet count, prior to every study treatment dosing. 
Blood Chemistry: Sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorous, BUN, magnesium, creatinine, total protein, albumin, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose. For patients with extensive liver 
involvement, a marked increase in liver function test results warrants radiological tumor assessment to verify or refute disease progression.  
Urine analyses: dipstick (WBC, RBC); urine protein, urine creatinine, and  UPCR  will be calculated on morning urine spot prior to each aflibercept/placebo infusion. During study treatment, 24-h urine collection should be 
performed to quantify proteinuria when UPCR>1; ; in case UPCR>2 or in case of proteinuria of renal origin (according to urine protein electrophoresis) is associated with hematuria then a blood work-up in search for hemolytic 
anemia of microangiopathic origin should be initiated and a nephrologist consultation should be considered. This work up could include LDH, haptoglobin, schistocytes and orosomucoid whenever possible.  
Coagulation: prothrombin time, expressed as international normalized ratio, will be assessed in patients under treatment with Vitamin K antagonist. 
Pregnancy Test: Women of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test result (serum or urine) within 8 days prior to randomization. To be repeated as clinically indicated. 
Randomization: All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups (either aflibercept + gemcitabine or placebo + gemcitabine) using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). Study treatment 
should be started within 3 days from randomization. 
Study Drug Administration: Aflibercept /placebo will be administered every 2 weeks immediately followed by gemcitabine administered on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In addition, gemcitabine will be administered alone on 
Day 8 of each 28-day cycle and on Day 22 of Cycle 1. Basically gemcitabine will be administered weekly for 7 weeks followed by 1 week rest, and then weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest. 

m.  Adverse Event Assessment: The period of safety observation starts from the time the patient gives informed consent. Whenever possible, symptoms should be reported as a single syndrome or diagnosis. Laboratory 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AE only if they are serious, and/or if they lead to study treatment modification (dose reduction, cycle delay, infusion temporary interrupted), or study treatment discontinuation. 
Signs/symptoms that are present, or occurred, from the time the patient has signed the ICF to first study drug administration will be recorded as AEs, at cycle 1, if present at the time of first administration of study 
treatment. SAEs will be recorded from the time the patient has signed the inform consent. During the treatment period AEs will be collected at each visit up to the 30-day FU visit. During the FU period -i.e. after 30-day 
FU visit-, only related ongoing, or new related, AEs will be recorded. SAEs, regardless of relationship with study treatment, ongoing at the end of study treatment, will be followed during the FU period until resolution or 
stabilization. 
Assessment of Concomitant Medications: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 21 days prior to the start of study treatment, before every cycle during the study treatment period, and up to 30 days after 
the final dose of study treatment. Once the patient has withdrawn from study treatment, concomitant medication should only be recorded if used to treat new or unresolved study treatment related adverse events. 
Tumor Assessment: abdominal CT-Scan or  MRI, Chest X-Ray (or chest CT-Scan or MRI in case of thoracic target lesion) and other exams as clinically indicated to assess target and non target lesions to be performed at baseline, 
then every 8 weeks during study treatment, and at the end of study treatment visit, using the same method for each assessment. For the purpose of analysis, a CR or PR will be considered a confirmed response if a subsequent 
assessment has been performed 4 – 6 weeks after the first assessment and the results confirm the initial finding. If patients discontinue study treatment without documented disease progression, then tumor assessments must 
continue to be performed every 8 weeks until disease progression is documented. 
CA19-9 will be performed using commercially available assay at the same timepoints than tumor assessments, and will not drive the decision making in term of study treatment continuation or discontinuation. 
Clinical Benefit: Tumor related symptoms will be based on a composite score of pain severity assessed by VAS, analgesic consumption as morphine equivalents, ECOG PS and weight change from baseline. During the follow-up 
period, patients who went off study treatment prior to documented disease progression will be evaluated for clinical benefit every 8 weeks until disease progression or start of other anticancer therapy. 
Survival Status:  During the follow-up period, once disease progression is documented, patients will be followed to collect his/her survival status (dead, alive, or lost to follow-up) until death or study cut-off date. 
Pharmacokinetics intended for all randomized and treated patients: Blood sample for measurement of free aflibercept and aflibercept:VEGF complex to be collected pre-dose and at the end of aflibercept/placebo infusion 1 on 
Day 1 (cycle 1), then at pre-dose on day 1 of each cycle (i.e. aflibercept/placebo infusion 3 cycle 2, infusion 5 cycle 3, infusion 7 cycle 4, infusion 9 cycle 5, etc…), at approximately 30 days and 90 days after the last 
aflibercept/placebo administration. Refer to Appendix G for collection, handling, and shipping instructions. In all patients that are randomized at study sites that are equipped with 4°C centrifuge, one sample will be collected pre-
dose of aflibercept/placebo infusion 1 Cycle 1 to measure endogenous VEGF. 
Serum for detection of anti- aflibercept  antibodies (in all randomized and treated patients) will be collected at pre-dose of Cycle 1 (before first aflibercept/placebo infusion), then at pre-dose on day 1 of each cycle (i.e. 
aflibercept/placebo infusion 3 cycle 2, infusion 5 cycle 3, infusion 7 cycle 4, infusion 9 cycle 5, etc…), at approximately 30 days and 90 days after last aflibercept/placebo infusion, and in all patients in specific circumstances 
detailed in section 8.5.1. Refer to Appendix G for collection, handling, and shipping instructions.

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 

4.1 

PANCREATIC CANCER 

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers and continues to be a major unsolved health 
problem at the start of the 21st century.  Pancreatic cancer represents the fourth leading cause of 
cancer mortality in the Unites States with an estimated 32,300 deaths attributed to this disease and 
about 45,600 deaths in the European Community in 2002 (1).  This number has been quite steady 
over the past 3-5 years.  This aggressive malignancy is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage 
(around 80% of patients have an unresectable disease at presentation) and lack of effective 
therapy are resulting in a dramatically poor survival, 20% after two years and only 3% after five 
years, the lowest of any cancer site (2). 

4.1.1  Chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer 

Due to the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis, chemotherapy becomes the primary 
therapeutic modality, the objectives of which are palliation of symptoms (clinical benefit), 
improvement of quality of life, and extended survival. The majority of patients with advanced 
pancreatic cancer have a high burden of symptoms at the time of diagnosis, including pain, 
fatigue, weight loss, and jaundice. Pain is the most common symptom and is observed in many as 
80% of patients. 

Chemotherapy options for non operable advanced pancreatic cancer are limited.  For the past 
decade, gemcitabine has been considered the standard chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of 
locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer based on a prospective clinical trial, that 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in clinical benefit response (CBR) (as 
measured by weight gain, decreased pain medication need, or increased performance status; 
22.2% vs 4.8%, P=.0022) and 5-week gain in median survival over that achieved with bolus 5-
Fluorouracil (5-FU) for clinically symptomatic patients (3-4).  In that and subsequent studies, 
gemcitabine monotherapy resulted in median survivals and 1-year survival rates of approximately 
6 months and 20% respectively.  Subsequently gemcitabine was tested in combination with 
various cytotoxic (including platinum analogs, topoisomerase inhibitors, taxanes, antifolates and 
oral fluoropyrimidines) and targeted agents in various attempts to improve outcomes. Although 
endpoints, including response rates and progression free survival, were improved significantly in 
some studies, a significant survival advantage was not demonstrated until the results of 
gemcitabine plus erlotinib trial became available in 2005 (see Table 1) (4-21). 

One phase III comparing the combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine with gemcitabine alone 
has shown a significantly improved median and 1-year survival in favor of the combination arm: 
7.4 months versus 6.0 months and 26% versus 19%, respectively, with a favorable safety profile 
(10). Other studies with gemcitabine, with or without IV 5-FU, all failed to show a difference 
between gemcitabine monotherapy and combination treatment (7-9).

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 2

The first agent that has shown a survival benefit for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is 
the oral EGFR TKI erlotinib (Tarceva®). When combined with gemcitabine, the hazard ratio for 
survival is 0.81, which reflects a 19% reduction in the rate of death for this disease (5).  On the 
subgroup analysis, patients with metastatic cancer showed a better effect (hazard ratio = 0.80, 
median OS improvement from 5.1 to 5.9 months) compared to the population with locally 
advanced cancer (hazard ratio = 0.93).  Given the statistically significant but clinically modest 
survival benefit, some may question whether use of erlotinib and gemcitabine constitutes a new 
standard of care.  The standard treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer remains 
controversial and the choice of the reference treatment in clinical trials is difficult.  It is therefore 
reasonable to use gemcitabine alone as a backbone regimen for the addition of other targeted 
agent such as aflibercept.  In addition, an add-on design, double-blind versus placebo, will allow 
to isolate the potential effect of aflibercept on safety and efficacy as compared to the control 
therapy.

4.1.2  Tumor angiogenesis 

Several malignant tumors are dependent on angiogenesis to maintain a source of nutrition and 
oxygen from the body to support their growth and metastasis [22]. VEGF, also known as Vascular 
Permeability Factor (VPF), is a cytokine that was discovered in the late 1970s [23]. It is a 
homodimeric protein which binds to and activates two high-affinity receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR1) 
and Flk-1 (VEGFR2), predominantly located on the vascular endothelium. VEGF is a powerful 
mitogen for endothelial cells, thus promoting formation of new vessels that are required for 
normal and neoplastic tissue growth. In addition, VEGF very potently increases vessel 
permeability [24]. Therefore, VEGF become a major target for anti-angiogenic therapy because its 
overexpression in several tumor types has been associated with increased tumor vascularity, 
proliferation, progression, invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis [25-27]. 

Several studies in animal models and, more recently, human clinical trials, have demonstrated the 
efficacy of anti-VEGF approaches to cancer treatment. By additionally “normalizing” tumor 
vasculature and reducing tumor interstitial fluid pressure, VEGF antagonists may enhance 
intratumoral delivery of traditional cytotoxic agents thereby improving their antitumor efficacy 
without overlapping toxicity [28]. Convincing clinical evidence in support of this therapeutic 
approach was first demonstrated by the humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, 
bevacizumab (Avastin®), which was granted FDA approval in February 2004 in combination with 
IV 5-FU-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of 
the colon or rectum. This was followed by full approvals in Switzerland, Israel, and the European 
Union. Avastin® significantly improved the progression-free and overall survival of previously 
untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients in combination with irinotecan/bolus 5-
FU/LV (IFL) chemotherapy as compared to patients treated with IFL alone [29], the approved 
standard first-line MCRC treatment control.  

Aflibercept (also refers as AVE0005 or VEGF Trap in other related documents) is a novel anti-
angiogenic protein, which interferes with the biological actions of VEGF by complexing VEGF 
and preventing it from interacting with its receptors on endothelial cells. Further details can be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure [30], which contains comprehensive information on 
aflibercept.

4.1.3  Angiogenesis and pancreatic cancer 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Although pancreatic adenocarcinoma is not a grossly vascular tumor, this malignancy often 
exhibits enhanced foci of endothelial cell proliferation and frequently overexpresses vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor that is secreted by many tumor cell 
lines. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is commonly overexpressed in pancreatic 
cancer, and high levels of VEGF correlate with both advanced-stage disease and poorer patient 
survival [31]. The inhibition of VEGF and VEGF receptor signaling suppressed pancreatic cancer 
growth in vitro and in animal models [32] suggesting that VEGF blockade may be an interesting 
therapeutic approach. 

4.2 

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 

Aflibercept is a recombinantly-produced fusion protein consisting of human VEGF receptor 
extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. It contains sequences encoding Ig 
domain 2 from VEGFR1 fused to Ig domain 3 from VEGFR2, which in turn is fused to the hinge 
region of the human IgG1 Fc domain. Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a molecular 
weight of 115 kDa. Aflibercept is made recombinantly in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

•  Aflibercept is a specific antagonist that binds and inactivates circulating VEGF in the 

bloodstream and in the extravascular space.  Aflibercept was designed to prevent the growth 
of primary and metastatic tumors by reducing tumor vascularity and vascular permeability 
with several potential advantages over other VEGF blockers: 

 

•  Aflibercept has a much higher VEGF-A binding affinity (0.5 pM dissociation constant 

for VEGF165 and VEGF121) than a humanized monoclonal antibody (~800 pM),

•  Aflibercept also binds VEGF-B plus the related factors PlGF1 and PlGF2 which may 
be advantageous in certain disease settings (e.g., malignant ascites where PlGF may 
mediate vascular permeability), 

•  Aflibercept has a longer circulating half-life compared to other soluble receptor 

constructs that have been studied in animals. 

4.3  OVERVIEW OF PRECLINICAL INFORMATION 

Detailed information regarding the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of aflibercept, including the 
results of preclinical efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic studies, can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure [30].  In particular, compound-related microscopic findings in primates 
were observed in the bone, kidney, and ovary.  Most kidney findings were very slight or slight and 
aflibercept was not highly immunogenic in monkeys. In all animal species evaluated, free 
aflibercept was characterized by a low clearance, a low volume of distribution, and a long 
apparent elimination half-life.  Aflibercept inhibition of tumor growth in mouse xenograft models 
was observed at ≥ 2.5 mg/kg twice weekly dose, which corresponded to a pharmacological 
exposure where free aflibercept increases approximately linearly in excess of plateauing 
aflibercept complex (i.e., bound aflibercept) levels. 

The ability of systemically administer aflibercept to prevent the vascular leak induced by VEGF 
was evaluated in a model of ascites formation.  Human ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR-3) were 
implanted into the peritoneum of nude mice.  These animals developed significant tumor burden 
and ascites over a period of approximately 8 weeks.  Treatment with aflibercept initiated 2 weeks 
after tumor cell inoculation prevented the formation of ascites and decreased tumor burden in 
these mice by >50% [33]. 

Fukasawa M et al [34] reported that aflibercept suppresses the s.c. growth of four distinct 
pancreatic cell lines in athymic nude mice and that this effect is associated with a marked decrease 
in microvesel density. In addition, using an orthotopic model, aflibercept is shown to attenuate 
intrapancreatic tumor growth and regional and distant metastasis. These findings support the 
hypothesis that VEGF-A has an important role in pancreatic cancer in vivo and raise the 
possibility that may ultimately provide a novel therapeutic option for management of this disease. 

4.4 

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS HUMAN EXPERIENCE 

Sofar, around 600 patients have been treated with aflibercept, either in monotherapy or combined 
with various chemotherapies (oxaliplatin, 5-FU, irinotecan, gemcitabine, docetaxel, 
docetaxel/cisplatin and docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU).  In general, aflibercept has an accepatble safety 
profile at the dose levels evaluated to date, as the majority of adverse events encountered have 
been mild to moderate in severity.  Adverse reactions linked with VEGF blockade have been 
reported with consistent incidences and severity, across all the studies.  Detailed information 
regarding the clinical safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of 
aflibercept can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure [30].

4.4.1  Summary of clinical experience of aflibercept in monotherapy 

Study TED6115/6116 is an ongoing open-label dose-escalation study of aflibercept given in 
monotherapy in patients with various advanced cancers. Doses, ranging from 0.3 mg/kg to 7.0 
mg/kg iv, administered once every 2 weeks, were investigated for a median of 3 to 7 cycles. 
Overall 46 patients have been enrolled and have received 1 to 50 cycles. 

Six out of 46 (13%) patients experienced dose limiting toxicity (ies) (DLT) within the first 4 
weeks of study treatment, influencing dose escalation or cohort extension decision. One patient at 
the 1.0 mg/kg dose experienced grade 3 arthralgia associated with grade 3 dysphonia, at the 2.0 
mg/kg dose, 1 patient experienced grade 3 dyspnea (patient with preexisting COPD). At 4.0 
mg/kg dose, 1 patient experienced grade 3 hypertension and another patient had grade 2 
proteinuria (>2.0 g/24hours) associated with grade 3 manageable hypertension. Two patients at 
the 7.0 mg/kg dose level reported DLTs, 1 grade 3 rectal ulcer and the other patient developed 
grade 3 proteinuria that recovered and continued treatment at the 4 mg/kg dose. 

Treatment emergent adverse events, consisting mostly of low grade events, were reported in most 
of the patients (Table 2). No evident particular pattern, in frequency or in severity of the adverse 
events, could be identified across the investigated doses. The five most frequent TEAEs reported 
were fatigue (84.8%), nausea (65.2%), constipation (54.3%), dysphonia (50.0%) and dyspnea 
(50.0%). 

Adverse events that may be related to VEGF blockade, were observed across all dose levels. 
Overall incidences for these events were: dysphonia (50.0%), hypertension (41.3%), proteinuria 
(19.6%), epistaxis (13.0%). No arterial ischemic event was reported.

The most frequently reported grade 3-4 AE was HBP in 15/46 (32.6%) of the patients (Table 3). 
At doses of 4 mg/kg or above, half of the patients (11 out of 23 treated patients) experienced a 
a grade 3-4 blood pressure increase. Grade 3 HBP seems to occur earlier in the treatment as the 
dose is escalated from 4 mg/kg. Hypertension is reported within 2 weeks of the first drug 
administration. Severe proteinuria (grade 3) was observed in 2 (4.3%) patients. Fatigue was the 
only other grade 3 AE to be reported in more than 5 patients.

The pharmacokinetics of free aflibercept appeared to be linear between the 2 and 7 mg/kg dose 
levels while bound aflibercept increased with dose between 0.3 and 2 mg/kg, then plateaued 
between 2 and 7 mg/kg, suggesting that free aflibercept was present in sufficient amount to bind 
all endogenous VEGF at these higher dose levels. Free aflibercept levels have remained in excess 
of bound levels (ratio >1) throughout the dosing intervals at ≥ 2.0 mg/kg dose levels.

Based on the above adverse events, thought to be related to VEGF blockade or not, formal DLTs 
as well as AEs resulting in discontinuation, safety profile, pharmacokinetic results, and clinical 
benefit across dose levels, it was recommended to select 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks for aflibercept 
administered as a single agent. This is independently supported by the safety experience from 
currently ongoing phase II studies of aflibercept administered as single agent, in the indications of 
non small cell lung adenocarcinoma and advanced ovarian carcinoma (either at doses of 2 or 4 
mg/kg every 2 weeks).  The safety profile in these trials is similar to the phase I study described 
above with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2. The adverse events most frequently reported 
are: hypertension, proteinuria, epistaxis, dysphonia/hoarseness, pain (including abdominal pain 
and back pain), asthenia/ fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache, constipation, increase in liver 
enzymes, myalgia, arthralgia, dyspnea, decreased appetite and diarrhea. 

4.4.2  Phase I Combination studies 

A total of 5 combination phase 1 studies of aflibercept (every 2 or 3 weeks) have started with the 
primary objectives of evaluating DLT and determining an RPTD in combination with standard 
cytotoxic chemotherapy agents/regimens administered at a fixed dose based on safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. 

So far, in all combination tested, aflibercept has been well tolerated with acute and reversible 
adverse reactions (mainly high blood pressure), no cumulative or late toxicity have been observed. 
In addition, no evidence of exacerbation of background chemotherapy-related toxicities was 
observed. The adverse events thought to be associated with VEGF blockade such as HBP, 
epistaxis, hoarseness/dysphonia, proteinuria are presented in Table 4.

The dose selection in each combination took into account the combination of DLTs/overall safety 
profile and pharmacokinetics together with observation of DLTs at these doses. The selected dose 
in each study was based on the aflibercept free/bound ratio >1. This ratio should be >1 during the 
two- or three-week period and approaching 1 at the end of the cycle for all the patients. The 
aflibercept dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks (in combination with docetaxel) and the dose of 4 
mg/kg every 2 weeks (in combination with irinotecan/LV5FU2, FOLFOX or gemcitabine) have 
been selected, which allows a same dose intensity of aflibercept whatever the schedule (every 2 or 
3 weeks) and is also consistent with the single agent dose selected (4.0 mg/kg q2w).

Study TCD6121 is an ongoing open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation, investigating intravenous 
aflibercept administered every 2 weeks in combination with weekly intravenous gemcitabine 
(1000 mg/m², 7 weeks on/1 week off x 1, then 3 weeks on/1 week off every 4 weeks) in subjects 
with advanced solid malignancies.  Based on the preliminary results of other ongoing phase I 
combination studies, the 4.0 mg/kg dose level was the starting dose level of aflibercept.  From 
April 18, 2006 to December 30, 2006, a total of 18 patients were enrolled and treated in the 
escalation step of the study across 2 dose levels: 6 patients at 4.0 mg/kg and 12 patients at 6.0 
mg/kg. 

Patient demographics were as follows: mean age 62.5 years (with 6 subjects ≥ 65 years), 
predominantly female (83%). With respect to cancer history, primary tumors were mostly 
pancreas (n = 8, with 2 and 6 patients at 4.0 and 6.0 mg/kg dose levels, respectively). Other 
primary tumor types include lung cancer, head and neck cancer, sarcoma and melanoma.  The 
median duration since cancer diagnosis was 33.8 months. All patients with pancreatic cancer

except one were first-line patients, whereas all other patients had received prior chemotherapy 
(median of 3.0 prior lines of chemotherapy, range: 1-11).

The median number of aflibercept doses administered was 3 (range: 2-9) and 2 (range: 1-8) at the 
4.0 and 6.0 mg/kg dose levels, respectively. The median number of gemcitabine doses 
administered was 6 (range: 4-14) and 5 (range: 1-16) at the aflibercept 4.0 and 6.0 mg/kg dose 
levels, respectively.  The median aflibercept relative dose-intensity (RDI) was 0.92 (range: 0.73 – 
1.0) and 0.95 (range: 0.53 - 1.0) at the aflibercept 4.0 and 6.0 mg/kg dose levels, respectively.  At 
the 4.0 mg/kg dose level, out of the 6 patients enrolled, 3 (50%) had at least one cycle delayed, 
and 2 (33%) experienced at least one dose reduction of gemcitabine. At the 6.0 mg/kg dose level, 
6 (50%) patient had a cycle delay, and 3 (25%) had their dose of gemcitabine reduced. There was 
no dose-reduction of aflibercept, at any of the dose levels, but one dose omitted at 6.0 mg/kg. 
Gemcitabine dosing was omitted twice (one patient in each dose level). 

One patient experienced a DLT within the first 4 weeks of study treatment at the 6 mg/kg dose 
level: grade 3 thrombocytopenia (25x109/L) associated with grade 2 hematuria was observed on 
day 15 after the first infusion of aflibercept and gemcitabine. Platelet count returned to grade ≤ 1 
within a week. 
Treatment emergent adverse events, mostly of low grades, were reported in 100% of the patients. 
Hypertension was observed with an incidence of 55.6% overall (50.0% and 58.3% at 4.0 and 6.0 
mg/kg, respectively). The incidence of Grade > 3 hypertension is 33% overall (16.7% and 41.7% 
at 4.0 and 6.0 mg/kg). One patient at 6.0 mg/kg discontinued the treatment due to hypertension 
grade 3, poorly controlled despite treatment. The incidence of proteinuria is 55.6% overall (33.3 
and 66.7% at 4.0 and 6.0 mg/kg, respectively). Two patients reported grade 3 proteinuria.

In conclusion, preliminary TCD6121 data suggest that the safety profile is quite similar across the 
2 dose levels explored, which is consistent with the preliminary conclusion of other combination 
phase I studies. However even if the incidence of hypertension is similar in both dose levels, there 
is more severe hypertension at the 6 mg/kg dose level. In addition, there is more patients 
experiencing proteinuria at the 6 mg/kg dose level.  Therefore the dose of 4.0 mg/kg every 2 
weeks in combination with gemcitabine has been selected.

In order to maintain endogenous free VEGF at very low levels (< 20 pg/mL, corresponding 
approximately to median value of endogenous VEGF in healthy subjects.) at the end of a cycle, a 
free / bound ratio higher than 1 is needed. At steady-state, mean free / bound trough ratios are 2.1 
and 5.3 following every 2 weeks infusion of 4 and 6 mg/kg, respectively. In this phase I study, at 
the steady state 6/6 patients had free > bound at the 4 mg/kg dose level as depicted in Figure 3.

STUDY RATIONALE 

Since 1997, gemcitabine has remained the standard of care for the treatment of advanced 
pancreatic cancer. However, this treatment is not curative, and thus new therapeutic options for 
patients with this disease are still desperately needed. The outcome of patients with locally 
advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer is different. Many trials have combined both groups of 
patients and some trials have suggested a benefit for one of the subgroups for the investigational 
treatment arm. Therefore, the target population in the current trial is patients with metastatic 
disease only. 

The recent modest survival benefit observed with erlotinib associated with gemcitabine over 
gemcitabine has validated targeted therapy as a rational approach for therapy of pancreatic cancer. 
VEGF is in addition a legitimate target. Aflibercept is a novel anti-VEGF agent that has a high 
affinity for binding VEGF and other related pro-angiogenic factors.  

Convincing clinical evidence in support of this therapeutic approach may be independent of tumor 
type with emerging reports of bevacizumab efficacy in combination with different chemotherapy 
regimens for the first-line treatment of MCRC, NSCLC, and MBC [26, 35, 36], and for the 
second-line treatment of MCRC [37]. However, the randomized phase III trial (CALGB 80303) of 
bevacizumab in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine plus placebo as a first-
line therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer did not meet its primary endpoint for overall survival.  
Therefore, the clinical evidence in support of this study in the first-line treatment of MPC may be

The present randomized placebo-controlled study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of the addition of aflibercept at the dose of 4 mg/kg (Section 4.4.2) to the registered doses 
of gemcitabine in the first-line treatment of patients with MPC. Stratification will be done 
according to ECOG PS (0 vs 1 vs 2), to prior curative surgery (pancreatectomy, yes vs no) and to 
geographical region.  Overall survival will be the primary efficacy endpoint, which will be 
analyzed after approximately 513 patients have died.

STUDY OBJECTIVES 

PRIMARY 

5.1 
•  The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate improvement in overall survival (OS) 
with aflibercept by comparison to placebo in patients treated with gemcitabine for metastatic 
pancreatic cancer. 

5.2 

SECONDARY 

The secondary objectives are: 
•  To compare in the two treatment arms  (by sequential order of statistical analysis): 

−  progression free survival (PFS),  
− 

clinical benefit, which will be based on the measurement of tumor related symptoms 
including a composite score of pain severity assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), 
analgesic consumption as morphine equivalents, ECOG PS and weight change from 
baseline. Clinical benefit will be assessed by time to symptom worsening (TTSW) 
evaluated from randomization to symptom worsening as well as improvement in tumor 
related symptoms. 
and overall response rate (RR) according to RECIST criteria (Appendix C),  

− 

•  To assess the overall safety in the two treatment arms. 
•  To assess immunogenicity of iv aflibercept. 
•  To perform population pharmacokinetic evaluation.

STUDY DESIGN 

This is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, randomized (1:1), double-blind, parallel-group 
study comparing the efficacy of aflibercept (Arm A) in terms of OS versus placebo (Arm B) 
administered on top of gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. 

6.1  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 

Each patient will be treated every 4 weeks, in the absence of definitive treatment discontinuation 
criteria outlined in Section 11.1.1.  

An Executive Steering Committee will be responsible for supervising the trial. 

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will periodically assess the progress of the 
trial, the safety data and will advise the Executive Steering Committee, as necessary. In addition 
the DMC will review the efficacy data from the planned survival interim analysis (IA).  

Treatment assignment will be done centrally via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) 
using a permuted-block randomization stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), prior curative surgery (pancreatectomy yes vs 
no), and geographical region. All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the control 
arm or the experimental arm in a 1:1 ratio. 
•  The study design is summarized in Figure 4.

6.2  DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Patients will be considered on study upon signing the informed consent form. As described in the 
study flow chart and graphic study design (see Section 1.1 and 1.2), the study consists of a 
maximum of 21-day period prior to randomization (baseline), followed by a treatment period, 
consisting of 28-day treatment cycles which will end by a 30-day Follow-up visit, which in turn 
will be followed by a post study treatment follow-up period (follow-up visit every 8 weeks). 

All baseline procedures (see Sections 1.1 and 1.2) will have to be performed within defined 
timelines, including review of eligibility criteria (see Section 7.2 and 7.3). 

The first study treatment administration will take place within 3 days of randomization. 

During the treatment period, the study treatment, either aflibercept or placebo, will be 
administered every 2 weeks unless a definitive treatment discontinuation criterion is met and then 
patients will remain on study until death or the study cutoff date. A cycle is defined as a 4-week or 
28-day period in both arms and includes 2 aflibercept/placebo infusions. Cycle lengths may be 
extended in case of unresolved toxicity (see Section 8.5). 

Imaging to document progressive disease will take place every 8 weeks and will continue to be 
done during the follow-up phase in case of early study treatment discontinuation (i.e. prior to 
documented progression). 

Once disease progression is documented, patients will be followed every 8 weeks for survival 
status and collection of data regarding further anticancer therapy, until death or until the study cut-
off date, whichever comes first. 

The patients will be followed for safety for a minimum of 30 days following the last 
administration of the study treatment (30-day Follow-up visit). Beyond this date, all study drug-
related AEs and all SAEs should be followed until resolution/stabilization. Study drug-related Aes 
and SAEs brought to the attention of the investigator at any time after the 30-day Follow-up visit 
should be recorded in the case report form (CRF). 
•  The termination of the study and the final data cut-off date for survival will be the date when it 

is determined that approximately 513 deaths have occurred. 

6.3 

INTERIM ANALYSIS 

One interim analysis (IA) of overall survival is planned to stop for futility or overwhelming 
efficacy when approximately 205 OS events (40% information fraction) have occurred. Statistical 
operating characteristics of this analysis e.g. stopping boundaries and α- and β- spending 
functions to maintain the type I and type II error rates are described in the statistical 
considerations (see section 13.6). 

The interim analysis will be reviewed by the DMC.

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

An Executive Steering Committee will include the Study Chairman, 2 main investigators and 
Sponsor representatives and be responsible for:  
•  Supervising the progress of the trial towards its overall objectives, 
•  Reviewing at regular intervals relevant information that may affect the study conduct,  
•  Discussing and supervising implementation of the recommendations of the independent Data 

Monitoring Committee. 

•  This committee will not have access to unblinded data sets before completion of the study, 

except if released by the DMC at the time of IA for overall survival (see Section 9.4). 

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) consisting of at least 3 external 
independent members not associated with the conduct of the study or other study committees will 
meet regularly to: 
•  Review the progress of the trial, 
•  Review the unblinded safety and efficacy data,  
•  Review unblinded results of the IA for OS, 
•  Advise the sponsor and the Executive Steering Committee on potential modifications or 

communications that may be necessary to ensure the patient safety or protect the scientific 
integrity of the trial. 

The first formal safety review of the trial by the DMC will be the earlier of either 6 months after 
the first patient has been enrolled, or the time when 100 patients will have been treated for a 
minimum of at least 2 treatment cycles. The DMC meeting will be set up semiannually. Ad-hoc 
DMC meetings may also be held if a significant safety issue or any other issue deemed important 
for the conduct of the trial arise, on this or on any other studies with aflibercept.  After each 
meeting, the DMC will advise the Executive Steering Committee and the Sponsor’s 
representatives regarding the patients’ safety, as well as the course of action regarding the conduct 
of the trial. 

The DMC procedures will be detailed in the DMC charter and will have to be approved by the

8.2.3  Preparation, reconstitution and administration for aflibercept 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Aflibercept and placebo vials will be supplied by the Sponsor. 

Aflibercept/placebo must be diluted in 0.9% NaCl (normal saline) or 5% dextrose prior to IV 
administration. The dilution must be carried out under aseptic conditions. 

Diluted aflibercept/placebo solution at 0.6 to 8.0 mg/ml can be stored up to 24 hours under 
refrigerated conditions (2° to 8°C) or for up to 8 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 
25°C) in polypropylene syringe or in infusion bags made of the following materials: 

•  PVC containing DEHP, 
•  Polyolefin (PVC free DEHP free). 

Diluted solution of aflibercept can be administered using infusion tubing made of the following 
materials: 

•  PVC containing DEHP, 
•  DEHP-free PVC containing TOTM, 
•  Polypropylene, 
•  Polyethylene lined PVC. 

The infusion sets must contain a 0.2 µm polyethersulfone filter. 

The research pharmacist or designee at the study site will prepare all aflibercept/placebo infusion 
solutions according to the instructions contained in protocol supporting documents. Multiple vials 
may be required in the preparation of each dose depending on the patient’s weight and the 
aflibercept/placebo intended dose. 

The volume of aflibercept/placebo to be administered to each patient, and hence the rate of 
infusion, will be based on each patient’s weight. The pharmacist or designee will prepare the 
dosing solution as follows: 

•  Calculate the number of aflibercept/placebo vials needed according to the patient’s 

body weight, and the aflibercept intended dose, 

Then either: 

•  Dilute the entire volume of each vial in the infusion bag of 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose, 
to obtain the final concentration of the diluted solution ranging from 0.6 mg/ml to 
8.0 mg/ml, 

•  Retrieve the excess of the diluted solution in order to obtain the exact amount of 

aflibercept/placebo to be administered to the patient. 

Or:

•  Withdraw the exact volume of aflibercept/placebo needed from each vial, 
•  And dilute directly into the infusion bag ( 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose) to obtain a 

final concentration of the diluted solution ranging from 0.6 mg/ml to 8.0 mg/ml. 

Infusion can be conducted by gravity or, with an IV infusion pump, or with a syringe pump using 
administration sets made of above listed materials. 

The infusion should not exceed 2 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 25°C). 

8.2.3.1  Precautions 

All drug packages are to be inspected upon receipt at the study site and the individual vials 
inspected prior to being drawn up. If a vial is chipped or any particulate matter or cloudiness is 
detected, the vial is not to be used. Cloudy or damaged vials are to be reported to the sponsor and 
returned to the refrigerator until instructions have been given. As aflibercept is a protein, the study 
vials are not to be shaken. 

Given the investigational nature of the product and to provide the patients with the maximum 
level of safety in case of an unexpected event, the following requirements must be fulfilled before 
any administration of the investigational product can start and for a minimum of 1 hour following 
the completion of the infusion:  

Immediate access to appropriate resuscitative equipment, 

• 
•  Personnel appropriately qualified and trained to use the above equipment (see also Section 

15.1 for delegation of investigator duties). 

Aflibercept/placebo should not be administered less than 48 hours following minor surgical 
procedures (e.g., fine needle biopsy/aspiration, placement of a central venous access device, or 
removal/biopsy of a skin lesion), or until evidence of wound healing (e.g., scab formation) is 
observed, whichever is longer. A peripheral venous catheter may be inserted prior to and removed 
immediately after individual study drug doses, for the purpose of study drug administration. 

Infusion and hypersensitivity reactions may occur during or shortly after intravenous 
administration of protein therapeutics. If infusion or hypersensitivity reactions occur in a given 
patient, institutional treatment guidelines for similar therapeutic agents or protocol guidelines 
should be followed (see Table 10). In case of severe reaction (grade ≥ 3), aflibercept/placebo 
should be permanently discontinued.  Blood samples for anti-aflibercept antibodies detection 
should be collected within 2 weeks for event of Grade ≥ 2 and then every 2-3 months, up to 6 
months following aflibercept/placebo discontinuation. Simultaneously to each antibodies 
detection, circulating free and bound aflibercept will be measured (see Appendix G for 
sample collection, handling methods and shipping procedures).

8.3  ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS: GEMCITABINE 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Marketed formulation of gemcitabine will be used. Refer to the package insert or summary of 
product characteristics for details on description, preparation, administration, and precautions for 
use. 

Gemcitabine is a deoxycytidine analogue, a pyrimidine antimetabolite related to cytarabine, which 
is formulated with mannitol (200 mg or 1 g, respectively) and sodium acetate (12.5 mg or 62.5 
mg, respectively) as a sterile lyophilized powder (hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may 
have been added for pH adjustment), supplied in a sterile form for intravenous use only.  

8.4  DOSAGE SCHEDULE 

Within 3 days after randomization, patients will be administered either aflibercept or placebo, 
depending on arm assigned. Immediately after, patients will receive gemcitabine. 

8.4.1  Aflibercept / placebo 

Arm A, aflibercept: 4 mg/kg will be administered IV over 1 hour once every 2 weeks, i.e. on Day 
1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle, prepared and administered as described in Section 8.2.3. 

OR 

Arm B, placebo: 4 mg/kg will be administered IV over 1 hour once every 2 weeks, i.e. on Day 1 
and 15 of each 28-day cycle, prepared and administered as described in Section 8.2.3. 

Dose adjustment will be permitted for subsequent treatment cycles based on individual patient 
tolerance. 

8.4.2  Gemcitabine 

Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV will be administered IV over 30 minutes on Day 1, 8, 15, 22, of 28-
day cycle 1, and then Day 1, 8, 15 of subsequent 28-day cycles. 

Dosage for gemcitabine is described below using the Body surface area (BSA). 

BSA will be calculated from body weight in kg, recorded prior to every gemcitabine dosing, 
and height in cm, recorded at baseline. The preferred Dubois and Dubois equation is below: 

BSA in units of m2 = wgt. in kg 0.425 x hgt. in cm 0.725 x 0.007184 

Patients with a BSA >2.1 m2 will use 2.1 m2 for the determination of gemcitabine dose. 

Dose adjustment will be permitted for subsequent treatment cycles based on individual patient 
tolerance. 

As a summary, patients will receive study treatment as follows (see Figure 5):

The use of any premedication is left to the current hospital practices. For gemcitabine, refer to the 
package insert or summary of product characteristics for details on administration and 
precautions. 

8.4.4  Schedule modification 

For both arms, it is a 4 weekly schedule. Plus or minus 3-day time windows are permitted, as are 
cycle delays of up to 2 weeks in case of unresolved toxicity at the time of planned re-
administration. In addition, infusion of aflibercept/placebo or gemcitabine may be omitted within 
a treatment cycle, in case of unresolved toxicity at the time of planned re-administration, for a 
maximum of 2 consecutive aflibercept/placebo or 4 consecutive gemcitabine infusions.  As a 
consequences 2 infusion of aflibercept/placebo may be given at a 6-week interval.  Doses may be 
modified or infusion delayed for toxicity as described in Section 8.5. New cycles of therapy may 
not begin until any study drug-related toxicities have been adequately resolved. Study treatment 
will continue until a definitive treatment discontinuation criterion is met (see section 11.1). 

Details of the exact dose, and time of administration of medication (day/month/year, and h:min 
for patients participating to the pharmacokinetics evaluation) and the labeling on the 
investigational product containers (including batch and/or lot numbers) will be documented in the 
CRF. In addition, complete Drug Accountability Records must be maintained at each site.

8.5  DOSAGE MODIFICATION:  

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Dose adjustment and/or cycle delay are planned in case of toxicity.  Dose adjustments will be 
made according the worst grade of toxicity observed within a cycle.  Toxicities will be graded 
according the NCI-CTC AE version 3.0 scale (40).  Patient will receive the next cycle after 
recovery of the toxicity as describe below. Patient may have dose omitted (aflibercept/placebo or 
gemcitabine) within a cycle if toxicity occurred and does not recover the theoretical day of 
infusion. 

The toxicities observed with gemcitabine are myelotoxicity (neutropenia, anemia and 
thrombocytopenia), nausea, vomiting, reversible ALT/AST increase, hypersensitivity (rash, 
pruritis, bronchospasm), cutaneous reactions in previously irradiated area. 

If a patient experiences several toxicities and there are conflicting recommendations, the most 
conservative dose adjustment recommended (dose reduction/omission appropriate to the most 
severe toxicity) should be followed.  Once a dose has been decreased, intra-patient re-escalation 
back to the previous dose level is not permitted. 

No more than 1 dose reduction as well as no more than 2 infusions omitted of aflibercept/placebo 
per patient are permitted. Aflibercept/placebo will be discontinued in patients requiring > 1 dose 
reduction of aflibercept or > 2 dose omission due to aflibercept toxicity. 

 

If gemcitabine is permanently discontinued, then aflibercept / placebo can be continued until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient’s refusal of further treatment. The end of 
study treatment will be the date of the last aflibercept or placebo administration. 

If aflibercept / placebo is permanently discontinued, then gemcitabine can be continued until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient’s refusal of further treatment. The end of 
study treatment will be the date of the last gemcitabine administration. 

In both cases the end of the study is death, cut off date for final analysis, or patient denied 
consent, whichever comes first. 

8.5.1  Aflibercept / Placebo 

Aflibercept / placebo doses will be modified according to the dose level described in Table 7

Benefit/risk assessment 

Hypertension therapy recommendations 

For patients without prior antihypertensive therapy, at the time of the hypertensive episode the 
initiation of calcium-channel blockers should be considered as a first-intent treatment. A close 
monitoring of the BP should be initiated for further adjustment in treatment, as needed. 
Ultimately, antihypertensive treatment must be individualized based on the presence of 
comorbidity factors such as diabetes, cardiovascular or renal disease, additionally taking into 
account the safety and the efficacy of any prior antihypertensive therapy received. In addition, 
oral and/or intravenous sodium intake should be carefully monitored in these patients. 

For patients already under anti-hypertensive therapy, efforts should be done to optimize the 
existing therapy before adding other agents as required to control the BP. 

When hypertension is accompanied by signs or symptoms of end organ damage such as 
hypertensive retinopathy, kidney function abnormalities (like progressive proteinuria), or any 
signs or symptoms of cardiovascular morbidity or central nervous system (CNS) morbidity, 
treatment with aflibercept/placebo should be interrupted.

Urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) corresponds to the ratio of urinary protein and urinary 
creatinine concentrations (expressed in mg/dL). There is a high correlation between morning 
UPCR and 24-hour proteinuria in patients with normal or reduced renal function. UPCR 
demonstrated very good to excellent performance for the diagnosis of both abnormal and 
nephrotic proteinuria at all renal function levels. This ratio provides an accurate quantification of 
24-hours urinary protein excretion [38]. 

UPCR to detect proteinuria, will be done on morning urine spot. If UPCR > 1, 24-hour urine 
collection to grade proteinuria will be performed. In addition, in case UPCR>2 or in case of 
proteinuria of renal origin (according to urine protein electrophoresis) is associated with 
hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic), then a blood work-up in search for hemolytic anemia 
of microangiopathic origin should be initiated and a nephrologist consultation should be 
considered. as detailed in Table 9.  

This work up could include LDH, haptoglobin, schistocytes and orosomucoid whenever 
possible. Delay in availabilty of part of the results should not delay consultation to the 
nephrologist. 
Proteinuria should always be assessed taking into account the presence or absence of 
hematuria and the blood pressure status of the patient. 

Table 9 summarizes the course of action with regard to aflibercept/placebo dosing, which will 
depends on the presence of hematuria and the level of 24h proteinuria results. Only one dose level 
reduction is permitted for aflibercept/placebo. 

Anti-aflibercept antibody detection as well as concomitant pharmacokinetics evaluation and 
subsequent FU should also be performed in patients reporting proteinuria >3.5 g/24h, or 
protenuria from renal origin associated with hematuria (Section 12.1.3.3)

Hypersensitivity reaction 

In case of hypersensitivity reaction, institutional treatment guidelines for this type of adverse 
event, or the following proposed guideline in Table 10 can be applied. Venous blood samples for 
anti- aflibercept antibody detection and for concomitant pharmacokinetics evaluation should be 
collected in any patient developing grade ≥ 2 systemic immunologic adverse event considered at 
least possibly related to study drug. 

Table 10 – Acute infusion reaction management 

Symptom Severity 

Mild-Moderate 
e.g., NCI CTCAE grade ≤ 2 cutaneous 
reaction, pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, 
tachycardia, anxiety, headache, myalgias, 
edema, nausea 

Severe 
e.g., symptomatic bronchospasm, generalized 
urticaria, systolic BP  
≤ 80 mm Hg, angioedema, anaphylaxis 

Intervention Recommendation 

Stop aflibercept/placebo infusion; 
Give diphenhydramine 50 mg IV and/or IV dexamethasone 10 mg; 
For grade 2 event: Collect blood sample for detection of anti-aflibercept antibody 
and for pharmacokinetics evaluation within a maximum of 2 weeks, and then 
every 2-3 months for follow up, up to 6 months from last aflibercept/placebo 
dose. 
Resume aflibercept/placebo infusion after subject recovery. 
 
Stop aflibercept/placebo infusion; 
Give IV diphenhydramine 50 mg and/or IV dexamethasone 10 mg and/or 
epinephrine as needed; 
Collect blood sample for detection of anti-aflibercept antibodies and for 
pharmacokinetics evaluation within 2 weeks, and then every 2-3 months for 
follow up, up to 6 months from last aflibercept/placebo dose. 
Discontinue aflibercept/placebo 

Reversible posterior leuko-encephalopathy (RPLS) or clinical symptoms related to vasogenic 
edema of the white matter: 

Clinical presentations are variable and may include headache, altered mental status, seizure and 
cortical visual deficit. Hypertension is a risk factor. MRI scans are key to diagnosis and typically 
demonstrate vasogenic edema (hyperintensity in T2 and FLAIR images and hypodensity in T1 
images) predominantly in the white matter of the posterior parietal and occipital lobes; less 
frequently, the anterior distributions and the gray matter may also be involved. RPLS should be in 
the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with unexplained mental status change, visual 
disturbance, seizure, or other CNS findings. RPLS is potentially reversible with early recognition 
of symptoms and timely correction of the underlying causes, including control of blood pressure 
and interruption of the offending drug, which are important in order to prevent progression to 
irreversible tissue damage. 

Gastro-intestinal Perforation 

In case a patient reported abdominal pain or increase in severity of pre-existing abdominal pain, 
with or without associated symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, constipation), he/she should be 
evaluated by a physician for possible gastro-intestinal perforation, as this has been reported with 
anti-VEGF agents.

8.7.1  Randomization 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

After each patient has completed the necessary baseline visit procedures, the corresponding 
baseline CRFs have been completed and the patient is deemed eligible for study entry by the 
investigator or designee, the study site will contact the IVRS. 

Treatment assignment will be done centrally via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) 
using a permuted-block randomization stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), curative surgery (pancreatectomy, yes vs no) and 
geographical region. All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the control arm or 
the experimental arm in a 1:1 ratio. 

The site will need to enter the following information regarding the clinical site and study patient: 

•  Personal site identification number 
•  Patient’s gender and date of birth 
•  ECOG performance status 
•  Prior curative surgery 
•  Weight 

The information above will be used to identify the study treatment arm assigned for the patient 
according to predefined randomization scheme. 

A confirmation fax or e-mail will be sent to the site detailing the patient’s initial kit number(s) 
assignment. A copy of the confirmation fax or e-mail should be retained in the patient’s records. 

Study treatment should begin within 3 days after randomization. 

The investigational product will be administered only to patients included in this study following 
the procedures set out in this clinical trial protocol. Patients withdrawn from the study retain their 
patient number, and new patients must always be allotted a new patient number. 

8.7.2  Treatment period (treatment re-allocation) 

Before each dosing of investigational product during the treatment period, the IVRS will need to 
be accessed again in order to receive another kit number(s) (1 or 2 depending on patient’s weight) 
containing the same investigational product as the one assigned at the time of randomization, as 
described in Section 8.7.1. 

The site will need to enter the following information regarding the clinical site and study patient: 
•  Personal site identification number 
•  Patient’s identification number (received at randomization) 
•  Patient’s gender and date of birth 
•  Weight and aflibercept/placebo intended dose in mg/kg

PACKAGING AND LABELING 

Please also refer to Section 8.1. 

8.8.1  Aflibercept or Placebo 

Aflibercept or placebo vials will be supplied in identical boxes corresponding to patient kits. Each 
kit will be labelled with a unique kit number. 
•  Aflibercept or placebo, as described in Section 8.1, will be packaged by the Sponsor or an 

approved contractor, in sealed, sterile, single-use vials. The vials containing either aflibercept 
or placebo will be labeled in accordance with the local regulatory specifications. 

Packaging reference (packaging number, batch number, or lot number) and quantity of vials 
dispensed to each patient must be recorded in the CRF/drug accountability form. 

8.8.2  Gemcitabine 

Commercially available gemcitabine vials will be used. 

Batch reference (packaging number, batch number, or lot number) and quantity of gemcitabine 
dispensed to each patient must be recorded in the CRF/drug accountability form. 

STORAGE CONDITIONS 

8.9 
•  Aflibercept or placebo must be refrigerated at 2 - 8°C (36 - 46°F) in a locked area with 

restricted access and handled in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 

•  Gemcitabine: refer to the package insert (PI) or summary product characteristics (SmPC). 

8.10  ACCESS TO THE RANDOMIZATION CODE DURING THE STUDY 

Please also refer to Section 9.4. 

In case of an AE, the code can be broken only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of 
the investigational product is essential for treating the patient. If possible, a contact should be 
initiated with the Monitoring Team before breaking the code. 

The IVRS center should be called if code breaking is necessary. Only if this fails, code-breaking 
material can be opened. 

For each patient, code-breaking material is supplied, containing the name of the treatment. Each 
treatment box will be labeled with a 3-panel label. The third panel, which is masked by a scratch 
off laminate, contains emergency and treatment (aflibercept or placebo) information. It will be 
kept in a safe place on site throughout the Clinical Trial. The Sponsor will retrieve all code-
breaking material (opened or sealed) on completion of the Clinical Trial.

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

If the blind is broken, the Investigator will document the date, time of day and reason for code 
breaking and the patient will permanently discontinue the investigational product (see Section 
11.1). 

8.11  RESPONSIBILITIES 

The Investigator, the Hospital Pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense 
aflibercept/placebo will be responsible for ensuring that aflibercept/placebo used in the clinical 
trial is securely maintained as specified by the Sponsor and in accordance with the applicable 
regulatory requirements. 

All aflibercept/placebo shall be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it 
is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of aflibercept/placebo issued 
and returned is maintained. 

Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of aflibercept/placebo (deficient IP in condition, 
appearance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expiry date, etc.) should be promptly notified to 
the Sponsor, who will initiate a complaint procedure. 

Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply aflibercept/placebo to a third party, allow the 
aflibercept/placebo to be used other than as directed by this Clinical Trial Protocol, or dispose of 
aflibercept/placebo in any other manner. 

8.12  RETRIEVAL AND/OR DESTRUCTION OF TREATMENTS 

All used treatments vials (aflibercept/placebo, gemcitabine) will be destroyed by the study site 
after an accurate accountability has been performed and signed by the investigator. 

The Sponsor will retrieve all partially used or unused vials of aflibercept/placebo treatments. A 
detailed treatment log of the returned aflibercept/placebo will be established with the Investigator 
(or the pharmacist) and countersigned by the Investigator and the Monitoring Team. 

The Investigator will not destroy the partially used or unused vials of aflibercept/placebo unless 
the Sponsor provides written authorization. 

A potential defect in the quality of aflibercept/placebo may be subject to initiation by the Sponsor 
of a recall procedure. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any 
request made by the Sponsor, in order to recall aflibercept/placebo and eliminate potential 
hazards. 

8.13  CONCOMITANT TREATMENT 

All treatments being taken by the patient on entry to the study or at any time during the study in 
addition to the study treatments are regarded as concomitant treatments and must be documented 
on the appropriate pages of the CRF (as defined in the flow chart, Section 1.1).

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study. However, if these are 
considered necessary for the patient's welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the investigational 
product, they may be given at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the CRF. 

The following concomitant treatments are not permitted during this study: 
•  Systemic anticancer agents other than aflibercept /placebo and other than gemcitabine. 
•  Concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs or devices. 
•  Concomitant radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or biological therapies. 

The following concomitant treatments should be administered with caution: 
•  Vitamine K antagonist therapy. 

The following concomitant treatments are permitted during this study: 
•  Ancillary treatment must be given as medically indicated; they must be specified in the CRF. 
•  Therapeutic or secondary prophylactic use of hematopoietic growth factors may be given at 

the investigator’s discretion and should follow American Society of Clinical Oncology 
guidelines for their use (42). 

•  Appropriate prophylactic anti-emetic therapy will be left to the current hospital practices. The 
addition of a benzodiazepine, e.g., lorazepam IV or orally, may also be considered if clinically 
indicated. 

•  Medications for chronic pain management, including narcotic analgesics, are permitted as 

clinically indicated. 

•  Medications for managing diarrhea, including loperamide. 
•  Antihypertensive medications are permitted as described in Section 8.5.1. 
•  Heparin medications are permitted as clinically indicated. 
•  All supportive measures (including blood transfusions and erythropoietin) consistent with 

optimal patient care will be given throughout the study and should be documented in the CRF.  

8.14  POST-STUDY TREATMENT 

Patients will continue to be treated as long as they are benefiting from study treatment and have 
not met study withdrawal criteria as defined in Section 11.1.  After withdrawal from study 
treatment, further treatment, if any, is at the discretion of the investigator. Please note that in the 
absence of documented progressive disease, patients should be followed every 8 weeks until 
progression or study cutoff date, whichever comes first.  Then, all patients will be followed for 
survival and vital status information will be collected at 8 weeks intervals until death or the study 
cutoff date, whichever comes first.

8.15  TREATMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMPLIANCE 
•  The investigator or pharmacist will inventory and acknowledge receipt of all shipments of the 
aflibercept/placebo. Aflibercept/placebo must be kept in a locked area with restricted access. 
Aflibercept/placebo must be stored and handled in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions.  

•  Administration of the study drugs will be supervised by the investigator or subinvestigator.  
•  The person responsible for drug dispensing is required to maintain adequate records of all 

study drugs. The labels of the aflibercept/placebo vials administered or dispensed to patients 
must be completed (patient number, and date of infusion, respectively). The packaging 
reference of aflibercept/placebo and the lot number of gemcitabine must be recorded in the 
CRF/drug accountability form, as well as the total number of vials per cycle. 

•  The person responsible for drug administration to the patient will record precisely the date 
when the drug is administered to the patient. Interruption of the 1-hour aflibercept/placebo 
infusion or 30 minutes infusion of gemcitabine will be recorded in the CRF. 

The study monitor will periodically check the supplies of aflibercept/placebo held by the 
investigator or pharmacist to verify accountability. All unused or partially used 
aflibercept/placebo and all medication containers will be returned to the sponsor unless other 
arrangements have been approved by the sponsor (see Section 8.12). The sponsor will verify that 
a final report of drug accountability to the unit dose level is prepared and maintained in the 
investigator study file.

The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival (OS) defined as the time interval from the date 
of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. In absence of confirmation of death, 
survival time will be censored at the earlier of the last date the patient is known to be alive and the 
study cutoff date. 

9.1.2  Secondary criteria 

The secondary and exploratory efficacy parameters will be assessed as follows: 

9.1.2.1  Progression Free Survival 
•  Progression free survival (PFS) will be evaluated from the date of randomization to the date of 

tumor progression or death (from any cause). 

9.1.2.2  Overall Response Rate  
•  Tumor response will be assessed by investigators according to RECIST criteria (Appendix C). 
•  At baseline, a CT or MRI scan of the abdomen, or other relevant organ system with target 
lesion(s) is required. Chest X-ray will be performed and chest CT scan/MRI in case target 
lesion in the lung(s)/thorax is/are identified. 
Imaging on study will be then performed every 8 weeks, using the same technologies, up to 
documentation of disease progression and whenever disease progression is suspected. 

• 

•  These tests will be repeated to confirm a partial or complete response (at least 4 weeks after 
initial documentation of response) and at the end of study treatment. The investigator at the 
site will be responsible for the assessment and collection of the radiographic information in 
compliance with the schedule of evaluations presented in this protocol. 

•  Disease progression will be determined by at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest 
diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since 
the treatment started, or unequivocal increase in the size of non-target lesions or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions. 

•  Hepatomegaly alone is not sufficient to assess progression. In the presence of evidence 

suggestive of progression, such as rising tumor marker, increasing liver enzymes, declining 
performance status, weight loss or increasing pain, every reasonable effort should be made to 
document the nature of progressive disease by appropriate imaging studies. The investigator 
may remove a patient from the study either for clinical progression when it is not possible to 
obtain an imaging study or for any other reason it is determined that it is in the best interest of

the patient to do so; however, the rationale for this decision must be recorded in the patient’s 
medical chart and in the patient’s CRF. 

•  Clear evidence of progression must be documented in the patient’s medical record and this 

data will be recorded on the patient’s CRF. 

•  Tumor evaluations will not be performed after progression is documented. 
•  During the follow-up period, patients who went off study treatment prior to documented 

disease progression will be evaluated by CT scan/MRI for tumor progression every 8 weeks 
from End of Study Treatment until disease progression or study cutoff date whichever comes 
first. 

•  The overall response rate will be defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed 

RECIST-defined complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) relative to the total number 
of patients in the analysis population considered. 

9.1.2.3  Clinical benefit 
•  Clinical Benefit will be based on the measurement of tumor related symptoms including a 

composite score of pain severity assessed by VAS, analgesic consumption as morphine 
equivalents, ECOG PS and weight change from baseline. The VAS is a line of fixed length of 
100 mm with words that anchor the scale at the extreme ends (no pain – worst possible pain) 
and no words describing intermediate positions. Patients will be instructed to place a mark on 
the line corresponding to their perceived state (average pain during the past 24-hour). Only 
validated translation in each local language for all participating countries is planned, but no 
conceptual framework is identified since this kind of scale was already used in the 
gemcitabine pivotal study. Clinical benefit will be assessed by time to symptom worsening 
(TTSW) evaluated from randomization to worsening of at least one symptom, as well as, 
improvement in any tumor related symptoms. 

9.2 

SAFETY 

AE data will be collected at specified intervals throughout the study.The results of weight, 
performance status and vital signs will be recorded in the CRF. Laboratory safety work-up will be 
carried out according to standard operating procedures by the local laboratory. Abnormal, 
clinically significant results will be verified to rule out laboratory error. Persistent relevant 
abnormal values must be followed up until the cause is determined or until they return to the 
baseline value. 

The study-specific and general safety criteria are developed in Section 10. 

9.3 

PHARMACOKINETICS AND IMMUNOGENICITY 

Prospectively scheduled immunogenicity evaluations are intended to be performed in all 
randomized and treated patients, at baseline, during treatment with aflibercept/placebo and 
after discontinuation of aflibercept/placebo. Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed at

the same time points with an additional sample at peak (end of aflibercept/placebo infusion 
1, cycle 1). 

For the purpose of of exploratory analyses, endogenous VEGF will be measured at baseline 
in all patients who are randomized at study sites equipped with a 4°C centrifuge (needed for 
preparation of the samples). 

9.3.1  PK handling procedure 
•  Vacutainer tubes will be used to collect 4 mL of whole blood from patients for plasma 
preparation for the determination of circulating free aflibercept and VEGF: aflibercept 
complex levels for pharmacokinetic analysis at the sampling times described in Section 9.3.3. 
Refer to Appendix G for detailed pharmacokinetic blood sample collection, handling, and 
shipping procedures.  

•  Red-top vacutainer tubes will be used to collect 4 mL of whole blood from patients for serum 

preparation for the analysis of anti-aflibercept antibody levels. Detailed anti-aflibercept 
antibody blood sample collection, handling, and shipping procedures are provided in 
Appendix G.  

•  CPD (or ACD) tubes will be used to collect blood sample for the analysis of free endogenous 

VEGF levels. A total of one sample per patient (4 mL) of whole blood will be collected for 
this evaluation. All specimens must be stored frozen at -20°C until shipped to sanofi-aventis. 
Refer to Appendix G for detailed pharmacokinetic blood sample collection, handling, and 
shipping procedures 

Blood samples should not be taken at the infusion site. 

The analysis of free and bound aflibercept and anti-aflibercept antibody levels will be performed 
by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Tarrytown, NY). 

The plasma free endogenous VEGF concentrations will be determined at sanofi-aventis, GMPK 
Alfortville under the responsibility of 

 

 
 

9.3.2  Sampling time for immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic evaluations 

Blood samples for sytematic prospective detection of anti-aflibercept antibody levels will be 
collected as described in Figure 6 at baseline, i.e. prior to the start of the first aflibercept/placebo 
infusion (cycle 1, day 1), then prior to each cycle (i.e. pre-dose of aflibercept/placebo infusion 
3 -cycle2, infusion 5-cycle 3, infusion 7-cycle 4, infusion 9-cycle 5, etc…), then approximately 
30 days and 90 days after last aflibercept/placebo administration. A minimum of 3 
samples/patient corresponding to 12 mL of whole blood will be collected in all randomized and 
treated patients (baseline, 30-day and 90-day follow-up visit).

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed at the same time points. In addition patients will 
be sampled at the end of infusion of aflibercept/placebo for cycle 1 for peak measurement of 
free and bound aflibercept. A minimum of 4 samples/patient and 16 mL of whole blood will be 
collected for these evaluations (baseline, end of aflibercept/placebo infusion 1, 30-day and 90-
day follow-up visit). 

Sampling for anti-aflibercept detection will also be performed on an event driven basis (see 
Section 12.1.3.3). The first evaluation (sampling for anti-aflibercept antibodies and 
circulating free and bound aflibercept) will be done within 2 weeks following the occurrence 
of the event (when this time point is not covered with the prospective evaluation). Follow-up 
will prolonged up to 6 months following discontinuation of aflibercept/placebo with 
sampling repeated every 2-3 months. 

Endogenous VEGF will be measured (4 mL of whole blood) on day 1 of cycle 1, prior to 
infusion of aflibercept/placebo (only when equipment for sample preparation is available on 
site, i.e. 4°C centrifuge).

9.3.3  Bioanalytical methods 

Free aflibercept concentrations in plasma will be measured by a validated ELISA method. The 
ELISA microplates are coated with human VEGF, which specifically binds functional aflibercept, 
while the detection antibody is directed against the receptor domains of the aflibercept. By

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

requiring a vacant VEGF binding site, this ELISA specifically measures free aflibercept; it does 
not detect the VEGF: aflibercept complex. 

The assay of VEGF: aflibercept complex will also be measured by a validated ELISA method. 
The ELISA captures the complex with an antibody selective for VEGF coated on a plate. The 
captured complex is detected with an antibody selective for the receptor domains of aflibercept. 

Human antibodies selective for aflibercept will be detected with an enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay that uses microplates coated with extracellular receptor domains of 
aflibercept. Immobilized receptor domain-antibody complexes are detected using peroxidase 
conjugated mouse anti-human IgG, F(ab’)2 fragment specific antibody. The calibration standard 
is a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the R1 domain of aflibercept that is detected with a 
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fc fragment-specific antibody. 

Free endogenous VEGF will be detected by sandwich enzyme immunoassay using an anti-VEGF 
monoclonal antibody coated on the plates. VEGF is detected using an enzyme-linked polyclonal 
antibody specific for free VEGF. The limit of detection is 15 pg/mL. 

9.4  MEASURES TO PROTECT BLINDING OF THIS TRIAL 

Please also refer to Section 8.10. 

Patients, investigators, and other persons responsible for study conduct and data analyses will be 
blinded to treatment assignment.  

All samples for PK evaluation will be assessed blindly (treatment arm and timing) and results will 
not be communicated to the study staff. 

During the course of the study an external statician (independent from the sponsor) will perform 
unblinded safety and efficacy (IA) analyses for the purpose of the DMC data review. Access to 
these data and analyses will be restricted to the DMC members, unless decision is made by the 
DMC to release results to the Executive Steering Committee. Conditions to release unblinded 
results to the Executive Steering Committee and processes to protect the integrity of the study are 
described in the DMC charter. 

In case of a SAE that is unexpected and reasonably associated with the use of the study treatment 
the code will be broken by the global safety officer in charge of the study for the purpose of 
regulatory reporting. 

In case of an AE, the code can be broken at the investigator initiative only in exceptional 
circumstances, when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for treating the patient. 
The investigator or authorized person should follow the procedures outlined in Section 8.10.

10  PATIENT SAFETY 

10.1  SAFETY ENDPOINTS ASSESSED IN THIS TRIAL 

Information on the following parameters will be collected by the investigator and reported in the 
CRF: 
•  Physical examination, including height (baseline only), body weight, ECOG PS (Appendix B) 

and blood pressure, 

•  Laboratory data, 

−  Complete blood count and clinical chemistry. 
−  Urinalysis and other tests as clinically indicated. 

•  Adverse events and serious adverse events. 
•  Concomitant medications and corrective treatments. 
• 

Immunogenicity evaluation (see Section 9.3) 

10.2  SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 

The NCI CTCAE v.3.0 will be used (Appendix D) to grade clinical and laboratory AEs.  

Every attempt should be made to have the same study personnel to perform the assessment 
throughout the study for any given patient for consistency of grading. 

Details and schedule of requested evaluations are given in Sections 1.1 and 1.2. 

AEs will be recorded on the CRF, with all requested attributes. 

If a finding meets the criteria for a SAE, then the appropriate procedures for reporting such events 
should be followed as described in Section 10.5.2.  

Signs/symptoms that are present, or occurred, from the time the patient has signed the inform 
consent form to first study drug administration will be recorded as AEs, in the cycle 1 AE page of 
the CRF, if present at the time of first administration of study treatment. Height will be recorded 
at baseline only. Body weight will be assessed every 2 weeks. ECOG PS will be recorded prior to 
the start of each gemcitabine treatment (i.e. day 1, 8, 15, 22 of cycle 1 and day 1, 8, and 15 of 
subsequent 28-day cycles) and every 8 weeks during follow up period until progressive disease is 
documented, or cutoff date whichever comes first. Blood pressure will be recorded during study 
treatment period, i.e. prior to the start of each gemcitabine treatment (i.e. day 1, 8, 15, 21 of cycle 
1 and day 1, 8, and 15 of subsequent 28-day cycles). 

SAEs will be recorded from the time the patient has signed the inform consent.

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

During the treatment period AEs will be systematically collected at each visit up to the 30-day FU 
visit. 

During the FU period (i.e. after 30-day FU visit), only related ongoing, or new related, AEs will 
be recorded. SAEs, regardless of relationship with study treatment, ongoing at the end of study 
treatment, will be followed during the FU period until resolution or stabilization. 

10.3  ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORING 

All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and 
included in the final clinical study report. 

10.4  DEFINITIONS OF ADVERSE EVENT (AE) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) 

An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 

A priori, efficacy endpoints as specified in the protocol will not be considered as AEs. 

A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•  Results in death or; 
• 
Is life-threatening or; 

Note: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
•  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or; 
•  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or; 
• 
• 

Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
Is a medically important event: 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. 

Note: Examples of such medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, convulsions or asymptomatic ALT increase  ≥ 10 ULN that 
does not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

10.5  OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 

10.5.1 Adverse Events 

The period of safety observation starts from the time the patient gives informed consent. 

All Adverse Events regardless of seriousness or relationship to Investigational Product, spanning 
from the signing of the informed consent form until 30 days after the last study treatment 
administration, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) included in the Case Report Form. 

At baseline (i.e. even in the absence of any administration of study treatments), all signs and 
symptoms will be recorded as adverse event only if they are still present at the time of first study 
drug administration or if they are serious. They are to be recorded on the corresponding AE page 
(s) included in cycle 1 of the Case Report Form. 

During the treatment period (i.e. until 30 days after the last administration of study drugs), all 
adverse events, regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatments, are to be recorded on 
the corresponding page(s) included in the Case Report Form. 

For follow-up period, refer to Section 10.5.3. 

Whenever possible, symptoms should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis. The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to study 
treatment, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome and 
his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the Adverse Event was caused 
by the study treatment. 

Vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as Adverse Events only if they are medically 
relevant: symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to study treatment 
discontinuation/study drugs dose modification and/or fulfilling a seriousness criterion. 

Laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as Adverse Events only if they leads to study 
treatment discontinuation/study drugs dose modification and/or fulfills a seriousness criterion. 

10.5.2 Serious Adverse Events 

In the case of a Serious Adverse Event the Investigator must immediately: 
•  SEND (within 1 working day) by email (automatic sending activated by ticking “save 

complete” (for the initial report) or “save” (for follow-up reports) the electronic AE/SAE 
notification (html format) to the representatives of the Monitoring Team in the Clinical 
Research Unit (Clinical Safety Officer and Clinical Research Associates) who then forwards 
to Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology and the Clinical Study Director. Before 
sending, please verify relationship to study drug has been indicated on the SAE 
complementary form.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 2 
EFC10547 
•  APPROVE the AE/SAE page in the electronic CRF immediately after automatic sending of 
the electronic Serious Adverse Event notification by entering, for a second time, “username 
and password”; 
If the mail connection is not functional or in case of any technical issue, SEND (within 1 
working day, preferably by fax) the signed and dated corresponding page(s) in the Case 
Report Form to the representative of the Monitoring Team whose name, address and fax 
number appear on the Clinical Trial Protocol; 

• 

•  ATTACH AND FAX photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these 

examinations were performed. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient’s identity is 
protected and the patient’s identifiers in the Clinical Trial are properly mentioned on any copy 
of source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory 
normal ranges; 

•  Follow-up of any SAE that is fatal or life threatening should be provided within one additional 

calendar week. 

• 

10.5.3 Follow-up 
•  The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, 
notably he/she should follow up the outcome of any related AEs (clinical signs, laboratory 
values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or consolidation of the patient's condition. 
In the case of SAE, the patient must be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and 
laboratory results have returned to normal, or until evolution has been stabilized. This may 
imply that follow-up will continue beyond 30-day follow-up visit and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the Monitoring Team; 
In case of any Adverse event or Serious Adverse Event brought to the attention of the 
Investigator at any time after cessation of study treatment and considered by him/her to be 
caused by the study treatment with a reasonable possibility, should be reported to the 
Monitoring Team. 

• 

10.6  PREGNANCY 
•  Pregnancy will be recorded as an AE in all cases. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it 

fulfills SAE criteria. 

• 

In the event of pregnancy, the study treatment should be discontinued and the Sponsor 
informed immediately (i.e. within 1 working day), even not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, 
using the AE form together with the SAE complementary form to be sent to the representative 
of the monitoring team whose name, address and fax number appear on the clinical trial 
protocol. 

•  Follow-up of the pregnancy will be mandatory until the outcome has been determined.

10.7  OVERDOSAGE 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

In case of accidental or intentional overdose with the IP, even not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, 
is to be reported to the sponsor immediately (within 1 working day) using the SAE 
complementary form to be sent to the representative of the monitoring team whose name, address 
and fax number appear on the clinical trial protocol. 

No case of aflibercept overdose has been reported so far. The highest doses that have been 
administered so far are 7 mg/kg I.V. every 2 weeks and 9 mg/kg I.V. every 3 weeks. 

For the purpose of safety reporting (as described above) dosing of gemcitabine above 1200 
mg/m² per infusion should be considered as overdosage. There is no known antidote of 
gemcitabine. In case of overdosage, refer to gemcitabine labeling for appropriate supportive 
care. 

10.8  OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 

During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study treatment, to the Authorities, IECs / 
IRBs as appropriate and to the Investigators. 

The determination of expectedness for SAEs, for regulatory reporting purposes, will be defined by 
the current Investigators' Brochure, in force at the time of event(s) occurrence. 

In addition, the Sponsor may report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are expected and at least 
reasonably related to the study treatment to the Authorities, according to local regulations. 

In this study, the SAEs considered related to the underlying condition will not be considered 
unexpected unless their course, intensity or other specific features are such that the Investigator, 
according to his/her best medical judgment, considers these events as exceptional in the context of 
this medical condition. 

Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure for aflibercept and/or 
contained within the reference safety information for gemcitabine on file in the 
pharmacovigilance will be considered as unexpected. 

The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the CSR.

11  HANDLING OF PATIENT DEFINITIVE TREATMENT 

DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION 

11.1  DEFINITIVE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION 

11.1.1 List of criteria for definitive study treatment discontinuation 

The patients may discontinue study treatment under the following circumstances but will continue 
to be assessed and followed in the study unless the patient refuses: 
•  The patients may withdraw from study treatment if they decide to do so, at any time and 

irrespective of the reason (consent’s withdrawal) or at the request of their legally authorized 
representative. “Legally authorized representative” means an individual or judicial or other 
body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective patient to the 
patient’s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research. 
If, in the investigator’s opinion, continuation of the study treatment would be detrimental to 
the patient’s well being, such as: 

• 

•  Disease progression as defined in Section 9.1.2.1, 
•  Unacceptable adverse event(s) not manageable by symptomatic therapy, dose delay or 

dose modification (see section 8.5), 
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of study treatment, 

• 
•  Non compliance to the study protocol. 

•  Patient is lost to follow-up. 
•  Of note, any investigational agent unblinding by the Investigator will lead to permanent 

investigational agent discontinuation. 

 
In all cases, the reason for and date of withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the patient's 
medical records. The patient must be followed up to establish whether the reason was an adverse 
event, and, if so, this must be reported in accordance with the procedures in Section 10.5. 

11.1.2 Handling of patients after definitive treatment discontinuation 

All definitive treatment discontinuation should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate 
pages when considered as confirmed. 

After study treatment is discontinued, patients should perform 30-day FU visit and then will be 
followed for disease progression (every 8 weeks imaging) if discontinuation occurred prior to 
documented progression and for survival status (every 8 weeks) once progressive disease is 
documented.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 2 
EFC10547 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Patients should be sampled 30 and 90 days following the last administration of aflibercept/placebo 
for immunogenicity and PK evaluation. 

Following the 30-day follow-up visit, ongoing SAEs and new related AEs/SAEs should be 
recorded/followed as described in Section 10.5. 

11.2  PROCEDURE FOR WITHDRAWAL OF PATIENTS FROM STUDY FOLLOW-UP 

SCHEDULE 

The patients may withdraw from the study follow-up schedule, before study completion if they 
decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s 
decision. 

All study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate CRF pages and in 
the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed (at least date of withdrawal and 
reason for). 
• 

If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the 30-day 
Follow-up visit as described in Section 12.1.4. 

The investigator must make every effort to contact patients lost to follow-up. Attempts to contact 
such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (e.g., dates of attempted telephone 
contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). Patients who did not complete the study and for 
whom no endpoint data are available will be considered as lost to follow-up. Patients lost to 
follow-up will be censored for overall survival analysis at the time they were last known to be 
alive (see primary endpoint definition in section 13.2.2.1). 

11.3  CONSEQUENCE 

Patients who have been withdrawn from the study cannot be reincluded in the study. Their 
inclusion must not be reused.

12  STUDY PROCEDURES 

12.1  VISIT SCHEDULE 

12.1.1 Pretreatment evaluation (Baseline / Screening visit) 

Each potential patient will be examined before the start of the study to determine his/her 
eligibility for participation. 

The written informed consent will have to be signed by the patient before any protocol specific 
procedures are performed. 

The following examinations will be performed within 21 days prior to randomization: 
•  Demographics: age (date of birth), gender, and race. 
•  Medical, surgical and cancer history including significant prior and concurrent illnesses, 

cancer diagnosis (primary tumor characteristics and metastatic sites). 

•  Prior anticancer treatment including previous surgery for cancer, radiation therapy, 

chemotherapy and potential investigational antitumor therapy. 

•  Tumor imaging: abdominal CT-Scan or MRI, chest X-Ray (or chest CT-Scan or MRI in case 

of thoracic target lesions), and all other exams as clinically indicated (e.g. brain CT-Scan or 
MRI in case of clinical suspicion of central nervous system involvement) to assess all 
TARGET or NON TARGET lesions (measurable and non measurable). CT-Scan/MRI will be 
preferred to X-Ray for the purposes of efficacy assessment. To ensure comparability, the 
imaging should be performed using identical techniques throughout the study period (i.e., 
scans performed immediately following bolus contrast administration using a standard volume 
of contrast, the identical contrast agent, and preferably the same scanner). Minimum interval 
between 2 assessments must be of at least 28 days (4 weeks). When available, spiral CT 
acquisition should be done. Slice thickness should be adapted to the anatomical area and 
presumed size of the lesions. Slice thickness of 5 to 8 mm should be favored rather than 10 
mm, especially during spiral acquisition. If limitations appear in volume acquisition, it is 
encouraged to choose a 1.5 pitch and thin slices, rather than a 1 pitch with thick slices. A 
centimeter scale should appear on films. 

•  Prior medications will be recorded from 21 days prior to the start of study treatment. 
•  CA19-9 will be performed, for exploratory purpose, using commercially available assay. 

The following examinations will be performed within 8 days prior to randomization: 
• 
•  Physical examination including major body systems examination, height and weight, ECOG 

Inclusion/Exclusion criteria.

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

•  Hematology: hemoglobin, WBC, ANC, platelet count, 
•  Blood Chemistry: sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, BUN, magnesium, 

creatinine, total protein, albumin, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, and glucose, 

•  Coagulation test: prothrombin time expressed as INR in patients under treatment 

with Vitamine K antagonist, 

•  Urinalysis: dipstick (WBCs, RBCs) and UPCR on morning urine spot or 

proteinuria assessed on 24-hour urine collection. 

•  Pregnancy test in women of reproductive potential: serum or urine β-hCG. 
•  Clinical benefit assessment: pain severity assessed by VAS (Appendix E), analgesic 
consumption as morphine equivalents, assessed during the week prior to first dosing 
(Appendix F). The VAS is a line of fixed length of 100 mm with words that anchor the scale 
at the extreme ends (no pain – worst possible pain) and no words describing intermediate 
positions. Patients will be instructed to place a mark on the line corresponding to their 
perceived state. 

•  The procedures described above are not to be repeated before study treatment administration 

for Cycle 1, provided they were performed at baseline, within 8 days of the start of 
administration and provided they did not show significant abnormalities. 

12.1.2 Randomization 

Randomization will take place once the consented patient has completed all the necessary 
screening procedures and is deemed eligible for study entry by the investigator or designee. All 
eligible patients must be randomized by contacting the IVRS (see section 8.7). 

The results of the baseline examinations will be recorded in each randomized patient’s CRF. 
Source documentation to support the screening results must be maintained in the patient’s medical 
record. 

Treatment should begin within 3 days after randomization. 

12.1.3 Study treatment 

The Study treatment period begins when the patient receives the initial dose of study drugs (Cycle 
1 Day 1). Each cycle consists of 28 days and assessments are scheduled on a every 2 or 4 weeks 
basis (Day 1, 15 each cycle) except for hematological tests assessed on a weekly basis (Day 1, 8, 
15 and Day 22 cycle 1 and Day 1, 8, 15 for subsequent cycles) but may be repeated more often, as 
clinically indicated. Cycle length may be extended if additional time is required for resolution of 
study drug-related toxicities or other adverse events, but cycle shortening to less than 25 days is 
not permitted.

12.1.3.3 Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity 

Prospective evaluations 

The evaluations are intended to be performed in all randomized and treated patients. All 
patients will be sampled for immunogenicity (anti-aflibercept Ab detection) and pharmacokinetics 
evaluations at baseline, during aflibercept/placebo treatment period and following 
aflibercept/placebo discontinuation: 

−  Baseline, prior to first administration of study treatment, 
− 
−  on treatment, prior to each cycle, i.e. pre-dose of aflibercept/placebo infusion 3 cycle 

just after the first administration of aflibercept/placebo (for PK only), 

2, infusion 5 cycle 3, infusion 7 cycle 4, infusion 9 cycle 5, etc…, 
approximately 30 days after the last infusion of aflibercept/placebo. 
approximately 90 days after the last infusion of aflibercept/placebo. 

− 

− 

In addition, a sample for the determination of endogenous VEGF level will be collected just 
before the start of the first infusion of aflibercept/placebo in all patients from centres where 
equipment for samples preparation is available, i.e. 4°C centrifuge. 

Event driven evaluations 

Beside the per protocol prospectively scheduled immunogenicity evaluations, patients will be 
sampled for both anti-aflibercept Ab detection and pharmacokinetics in a symptom driven manner 
when the occurrence of Ab is suspected.  
Patients experiencing infusion related reactions Grade ≥ 2 will be sampled for anti-aflibercept Ab 
detection and pharmacokinetics within a maximum of 2 weeks following the occurrence of the 
event, then every 2-3 months for FU, up to 6 months from last aflibercept/placebo dose. 

Similarly, anti-aflibercept antibody detection and subsequent FU should also be performed in 
patients reporting proteinuria >3.5 g/24h, or protenuria of renal origin assosciated with hematuria.

12.1.5 Post treatment Follow-up period 

Following 30-day FU visit patients will be followed every 8 weeks for PFS (if study treatment has 
been discontinued prior to disease progression) and then every 8 weeks for OS, until death or 
study cut-off, which ever comes first. 

The first follow up visit will occur approximately 90 days after the final dose of study treatment 
(i.e., 60 days after the 30-day Follow-up visit).  
•  The following evaluations should be performed: 
•  Blood sample collection:

SAE will be recorded until recovery, or until progression has been stabilized.  

•  Post medications if correspond to treatment of related AEs. 
•  Further anticancer therapy: After withdrawal from study treatment, further treatment, if 

any, is at the discretion of the investigator. No further antitumor therapy should be 
administered before disease progression unless the patient requests further antitumor therapy, 
or the investigator deems it necessary.

until death or the study cutoff date, whichever comes first. 

12.1.6  Study procedures after stop of the trial for futility at the interim analysis 

On 9 September 2009, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) requested to stop the 
EFC10547 trial for futility based on the predefined boundary rules. The following section 
describes procedures to be performed after this decision. 

12.1.6.1  Patients in follow up period on 11 September 2009 
 
The blood samples for detecting anti-aflibercept antibodies will be collected as planned in 
the protocol approximately 30 days and 90 days after the last administered dose of 
aflibercept. If these samples were already performed, no further follow up visit will be 
collected except for ongoing related AE and ongoing SAEs regardless of relationship, which 
will be followed until recovery or stabilization. 

12.1.6.2  Patients in treatment period on 11 September 2009 
 

•  Patient treated in placebo-gemcitabine arm 
 

Placebo should be stopped and all data related to ongoing cycle at the date of 11 September 
2009 will be collected. The End of study treatment visit should be performed and the End of 
Treatment e-CRF page should be completed with the reason "Other, study stopped further 
to DMC recommendations" (if decision of stopping study treatment was not taken during 
the last ongoing cycle). 
 
The investigator will have to perform the “permanent treatment discontinuation” call via 
IVRS to confirm that placebo treatment arm has been stopped.  No more “reallocation call” 
should be performed via IVRS after unblinding, for those patients randomized in 
placebo/gemcitabine treatment arm. 
 
If gemcitabine is then continued alone, the anti-cancer therapy page will be completed at the 
date of the subsequent follow up visit.  

If no related AE or SAE regardless of relationship is ongoing, the data collection will then be 
stopped. 

If a related AE or SAE regardless of relationship is ongoing at the end of this last cycle, the 
AE/SAE(s) will be collected in the AE FUP page until recovery or stabilization.  

Tumor assessment (CT Scan/MRI) will be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
but the corresponding tumor measurement are no more collected in the e-CRF after the last 
study treatment cycle.

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

 

•  Patient treated in aflibercept-gemcitabine  

If the patient does not want to continue to receive aflibercept, the recommendations are the 
same as for patients treated in the placebo-gemcitabine arm (see above) with the addition of 
blood samples for pharmacokinetics measurement and anti-aflibercept antibody detection 
(approximately 30 days and 90 days after the last administered dose of aflibercept) to be 
collected as per protocol pre-defined schedule. 

 If the patient wants to continue to receive aflibercept, patient will have to reconsent and can 
continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient’s 
refusal. Study drug(s) administration, SAE information and End of Treatment reason are to 
be captured in the e-CRF.  Blood samples for pharmacokinetics measurement and anti-
aflibercept antibody detection (approximately 30 days and 90 days after the last 
administered dose of aflibercept) are also be collected as per protocol pre-defined schedule 
and to be reported in the e-CRF accordingly. 

Then the data collection will be stopped except if a related SAE is still ongoing: the SAE(s) 
will be collected in the AE FUP page until recovery or stabilization. 

Patients will be followed as per institution’s standard practice and investigator’s judgment. 
Tumor assessment (CT Scan/MRI) will be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
but the corresponding tumor measurement are no more collected in the e-CRF in the study 
treatment cycle that start beyond 11 September 2009. 

At the time the aflibercept treatment is stopped (for any of the reasons mentioned above), 
the investigator will have to perform the “permanent treatment discontinuation” call via 
IVRS to confirm that aflibercept treatment arm has been stopped. 

12.2  DEFINITION OF SOURCE DATA 

Source data includes all information in original records and certified copies of original records of 
clinical findings, observations, or other activities necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation 
of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents. 

Source documents are original documents, data and records (e.g. hospital records, clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcripts certified after 
verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or 
magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medical-technical departments) involved in the clinical study. Source documentation must be 
maintained to support information provided within a CRF. 

The results of certain examinations or evaluations recorded in the CRF may be considered to be 
source data (such as patient’s VAS, diary…. ).

13  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

The statistical considerations presented in this section forms the basis for the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP), which will provide accurate definitions and detailed specifications for the analyses to 
be performed on the data collected from this study. A final SAP will be issued prior to the 
database lock of the interim analysis. 

13.1  DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 

The primary endpoint of this study is overall survival. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The cutoff date for the Overall Survival (OS) will be the date when the required 513 deaths have 
been observed. 

13.2  ANALYSIS VARIABLES 

13.2.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics 

Standard demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, gender, race, height and 
weight), medical history, cancer diagnosis, prior anticancer therapy, prior medications (other than 
prior anticancer treatment for pancreatic cancer) will be reported at baseline.  

Baseline efficacy and safety variables as well as other prognostic factors will also be assessed. 
These variables include tumor assessment, clinical benefit components (analgesic consumption, 
pain, PS, weight), CA19-9 marker, vital signs, ECG and major laboratory parameters.  

In general, baseline value is defined as the last value or measurement taken before the first dose of 
study treatment. A mean value can be considered for certain variables if multiple observations are 
collected at baseline (e.g. baseline analgesic consumption will be defined as the daily morphine

equivalent measured during the week prior to first dosing. Baseline VAS will be defined as the 
average score during the week prior to first dosing). 

13.2.2 Efficacy variables 

13.2.2.1 Primary efficacy variable(s) 

The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival defined as the time interval from the date of 
randomization to the date of death due to any cause. If death is not observed during the study, data 
on OS will be censored at the earlier of the last date patient is known to be alive and the cutoff 
date. 

13.2.2.2 Secondary efficacy variable(s) 

Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to 
the date of first observation of progression or the date of death (due to any cause). If death or 
progression is not observed, data on PFS will be censored at the earlier of the date of last tumor 
assessment without evidence of progression and the cutoff date. 

Objective response rate (RR) is defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete 
response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), defined by RECIST criteria, relative to the total 
number of patients in the considered analysis population (ITT or evaluable for response). Tumor 
assessments are performed at baseline, then every 8 weeks during the treatment and the follow-up 
period, up to disease progression. The analysis of RR will include tumoral assessments performed 
up to the initiation of an other anti-tumor treatment. In particular, for patients early stopping the 
study treatment without achieving a response, a tumoral response (CR or PR) achieved under a 
post-treatment anti-cancer therapy will not be considered. 

Clinical benefit components are assessed at baseline, during the treatment and on-follow-up as 
defined below:  

−  Analgesic consumption (morphine equivalents (mg) per day): recorded daily via a diary 

completed by the patients, 

−  Pain intensity (VAS): recorded daily via a diary completed by the patients, 
−  Functional impairment assessed by ECOG Performance Status: recorded at baseline, and 

at day 1, 8, 15, 22 of cycle 1 and at day 1, 8, 15 of subsequent  cycles and then every 8 
weeks during follow up period, 

−  Weight change (kg): weight recorded at baseline, at day 1 and day 15 of each cycle and 

then every 8 weeks during follow up period

accumulation) from baseline lasting 

at least 4 weeks 

Weight 

≥ 5% decrease from baseline lasting 

at least 4 weeks 

No change in weight (including 
Improvement/Worsening not 

confirmed) 

a: Narcotic analgesic increase/decrease will be determined by the calculation of the average morphenic equivalent calculated every  week 
b: Pain increase/decrease will be determined by the calculation of the average pain calculated every week 

Clinical benefit will be assessed by: 

- Time to symptom worsening (TTSW) is defined as the time interval from the date of 
randomization to the date of symptom worsening. Date of symptom worsening is defined as the 
date of the first change from baseline which meets the definition of worsening for at least one 
clinical benefit component. If symptom worsening is not observed, data on TTSW will be 
censored at the earlier of the date of last assessment without evidence of symptom worsening, the 
date of initiation of an other anti-tumor treatment and the cutoff date. 

- Improvement in tumor related symptoms is defined as the proportion of patients classified as 
clinical benefit responders, i.e. patient who has at least one positive component of clinical benefit 
(pain, performance status or weight) with none of the other components being negative relative to 
the total number of patients in the analysis population. Assessments performed up to the initiation 
of an other anti-tumor treatment will be taken into account in the analysis of improvement in

The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population will include all patients who have given their informed 
consent and for whom there is confirmation of successful allocation of a randomization number 
through the IVRS. Patients will be included in a treatment arm as randomized, regardless of 
whether patients received any study drug or received a different study drug from which they were 
randomized. Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed using the ITT 
population. Secondary efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed in the ITT population, and in 
evaluable patients whenever applicable.

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

13.3.1.2 Evaluable Patient (EP) population for tumor response 

Evaluable Patient (EP) population for tumor response will consist of all randomized and treated 
patients, with cytologically or histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer, with metastatic and 
measurable disease at study entry, in first line setting and evaluable for response (i.e. patients with 
at least one tumoral evaluation while on treatment, except for early disease progression/cancer-
related death). 

The EP population for tumor response will be used for the RR analysis (secondary population for 
RR analysis knowing that primary population will be ITT). Analyses using this population will be 
based on the treatment actually received.  

Protocol deviations 

During blinded review of the database, the compliance with the protocol will be examined with 
regard to inclusion/exclusion criteria, prohibited therapies, timing and availability of planned 
assessments. Protocol deviations will be identified by the clinical trial team before database lock 
and will be classified as minor or major deviations. The detailed definitions of protocol deviations 
will be provided in the final version of the SAP.   

13.3.2 Safety population 

The All-Treated (AT) population is a subset of the ITT population that took at least one dose of 
study medication. All analyses using this population will be based on the treatment actually 
received. Treatment administration/compliance and all clinical safety data will be summarized 
using the all treated population.  

13.3.3 Other analysis populations  

Clinical benefit population 

A specific population will be defined for the clinical benefit analysis. The clinical benefit 
population will include randomized patients, with baseline clinical benefit available, with a 
minimum pain score ≥ 20 and a minimum analgesic consumption ≥ 10. 

PK and immunogenicity population 

All randomized and treated patients will be used to collect samples to perform the complete PK 
analyses.  The pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed based on the all treated population 
with evaluable blood samples, at pre- and post-dose of infusion 1 cycle 1, pre-dose every cycle 
(prior to aflibercept/placebo infusion 3 cycle 2, infusion 5 cycle 3, infusion 7 cycle 4, etc…) 
and then at approximately 30 days and 90 days following the last aflibercept/placebo infusion e.g. 
whom had pre-dose and at least one post dose assessment performed. Peak analysis will be 
performed at cycle 1 (post-dose cycle 1) and trough analysis will be performed at each cycles. 

All treated patients will be used in the analysis of anti-aflibercept antibody measurement.

13.3.4 Disposition of patients 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Summary of patient populations will be presented with counts (n) and percentages (%). 

Study drug discontinuation will be summarized by reason for each treatment arm using the AT 
population. The premature discontinuation from the study will be also summarized by treatment 
arm and overall using the ITT population. 

13.4  STATISTICAL METHODS 

Continuous data will be summarized for each treatment group using the number of non-missing 
observations (N), mean, SD (standard deviation), median, minimum and maximum. In addition, 
25%-percentile and 75%-percentile may be provided if needed. In general, descriptive statistics of 
quantitative efficacy and safety parameters (result and change from baseline) by visit will be 
provided on observed cases, i.e. the inclusion of only subjects having non-missing assessments at 
a nominal visit. In addition, the tables summarizing the change from baseline will include only 
subjects having both a baseline and a post-baseline evaluation. 

In general, categorical data will be summarized for each treatment group using counts (n) and 
percentages (%).  The number of patients with missing data may be mentioned, but will not be 
included in the denominator for the calculation of percentages unless otherwise specified (in 
particular, see section 2.4.2 for handling of missing or non-evaluable data for efficacy response 
variables in Section 13.5.).  

Time-to-event (or event-free survival) data will be analyzed using means of Kaplan-Meier 
method. Median time-to-event (or event-free survival) and its 95% confidence intervals by 
treatment arm will also be provided 

13.4.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics 

All patient demographic and baseline characteristics, medical history, and diagnoses will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics using the ITT population. Analyses for the all-treated 
population may be presented if the number of patients differs substantially from the ITT 
population.  

13.4.2  Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 

Extent of study treatment exposure will be assessed in the AT population.  

The summary of extent of exposure will include number of cycles administered, duration of 
dosing (weeks), cumulative dose (mg/kg for aflibercept/placebo, mg/m² for gemcitabine), dose 
intensity (mg/kg/week for aflibercept/placebo, mg/m²/week for gemcitabine) and relative dose 
intensity (%) by treatment group. 

Dose delays, reductions, and interruption will be also summarized.

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

Concomitant medication and therapy while on study will be summarized by counts (n) and 
percentages (%). Medications of specific interest will be described in the SAP. 

13.4.3 Analyses of efficacy variables 

13.4.3.1 Analysis of primary efficacy variable(s) 

The null hypothesis is that aflibercept + gemcitabine or placebo + gemcitabine have equal overall 
survival in this population. Overall survival will be compared between the two treatment groups 
using a log-rank test stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1 vs 2), curative surgery (pancreatectomy, yes vs 
no) and geographical region. The estimates of the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence 
interval will be provided using a Cox proportional hazard model stratified by the baseline 
stratification factors. The median overall survival and its 95% confidence interval and survival 
curves will be presented by treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier estimates.  

The final OS analysis will be conducted when 513 deaths have been observed. One interim 
analysis of OS for the purpose of futility and efficacy is planned when approximately 205 (40% of 
deaths) have occurred. Using a group sequential approach with an O’Brien Fleming α-spending 
function and an overall one-sided α level of 0.025, the one-sided α nominal significance level to 
be used at the final analysis is 0.0249 (see details on interim analysis in section 13.6). 
•  Non stratified logrank will be also performed as sensitivity analysis. 

Additional exploratory analysis may be considered and will be detailed in the SAP. For example, 
the Cox proportional hazard model may be used to examine the effect of various baseline 
prognostic factors on OS (gender, age class, ECOG performance status, curative surgery, 
geographical region, clinical benefit components at baseline, CA19-9). 

13.4.3.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy variables 

Main secondary endpoints are PFS, clinical benefit (evaluated using time to symptom worsening 
and improvement in tumor related symptoms) and response rate. Analyses of secondary endpoints 
will be primarily based on the ITT population. Clinical benefit parameters will be assessed on the 
clinical benefit population. Response Rate will be also analyzed on the EP population. 

Improvement in tumor related symptoms and response rate will be summarized by means of count 
(n) and percentage (%) and presented with 95% confidence intervals. PFS and TTSW will be 
analyzed by means of Kaplan-Meier method. Medians and its 95% confidence intervals by 
treatment arm will also be provided. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval will be calculated 
after adjustment for baseline stratification factors based on the Cox proportional hazard model. 

The tests to be performed are Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (improvement in tumor related 
symptoms and objective response rate) and log-rank test stratified by ECOG performance status, 
curative surgery and geographical region (PFS, TTSW).

13.4.3.3 Type-I error rate control 
The overall one-sided α significance level of Overall Survival is 0.025. Hypothesis testings of the 
main secondary efficacy variables will be carried out. In order to protect the overall type-I error 
level, a step-down procedure will be used in the analyses of efficacy variables according to the 
following sequential order:  

−  OS, 
−  PFS, if test on OS is statistically significant 
−  Time to symptom worsening, if test on PFS is statistically significant, 
− 
−  Objective response rate, if test on improvement in tumor related symptoms is statistically 

Improvement in tumor related symptoms, if test on TTSW is statistically significant,  

significant. 

At each step, the procedure will stop if the test at the current step does not meeting the pre-
determined significance level. This procedure is applicable both at interim and final analysis of 
Overall Survival. All secondary endpoints among the step-down procedure will be tested at the 2-
sided 5% level, whatever the stage of the statistical analysis (interim or final). 

13.4.4 Analyses of safety data 

Analysis of adverse events, vital signs, ECG, and laboratory data will be descriptive and 
conducted on the all treated population by treatment group. Summary of safety data will also be 
performed by cycle (where applicable).  For each of the safety parameters, a baseline value will be 
defined as the last value or measurement taken up to the first dose in the study. 

13.4.4.1 Adverse Events 

TEAEs will be summarized with the number and percentage of patients with AEs, classified by 
MedDRA preferred term and intensity as graded by the NCI CTCAE version 3.0. 

SAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs will be summarized using MedDRA classification up to the 
preferred term. SAEs will be also presented by worst NCI grade by patients. 

TEAEs will be analyzed regardless of their relationship to the study drug. However, summaries 
will be done for specific subsets of AEs, such as those potentially related to study drug. 

13.4.4.2 Laboratory safety data 

Qualitative and quantitative results will be summarized for hematological toxicities. Qualitative 
data (worst NCI CTCAE grade) will be summarized by cycle and by patient.  

Biochemistry and urinalysis will be analyzed using the worst NCI CTCAE grade, whenever 
applicable (laboratory normal ranges, otherwise) calculated from laboratory values. Specific 
attention will be given to incidence of proteinuria and impairment of renal function.

13.4.4.3  Vital signs 

09-Nov-2009 
Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

By visit descriptive analyses of vital signs will be provided for observed values and change from 
baseline.  

13.4.5 Analyses of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables 

The PK analysis will include population pharmacokinetics of IV aflibercept with its associated 
interpatient variability. Concentrations of free aflibercept, VEGF:aflibercept complex, and the 
ratio free aflibercept to VEGF:aflibercept complex levels will be estimated. Levels of circulating 
endogenous VEGF will be assessed as well. 

The population pharmacokinetics of free and bound aflibercept have been estimated from the 
Phase I studies in which intensive blood sampling protocols were used. The population estimates 
from this analysis provided a prior distribution from which individual Bayesian estimates of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters for each patient in this study will be derived. 

13.4.6 Analyses of anti-aflibercept antibody measurements 

Anti- aflibercept antibody levels will be categorized as negative and positive. A patient will be 
considered to have positive anti-body levels if antibodies were detected above the quantification 
limits. 

13.5  DATA HANDLING CONVENTIONS 

Some general rules of data handling conventions are listed below. Further details will be provided 
in the SAP. 

Missing data: In general, no imputation is planned for missing data. The following approaches are 
default methods for missing data handling. Some exploratory analyses can be planned with 
different strategies for treating missing outcomes. The details will be provided in the SAP. 

−  Categorical data at baseline will be summarized for each treatment group using counts (n) 

and percentages (%). The number of patients with missing data may be mentioned, but 
will not be included in the denominator for the calculation of percentages unless otherwise 
specified.  

−  Efficacy response variable: When a proportion is calculated for a binary variable (e.g. 
response rate), the denominator is based on the total number of patients in the analysis 
population used for the summary (ITT, AT, evaluable). There can be 3 observations: Yes, 
No, and Non-evaluable (or missing). For the patients with non-evaluable outcomes, the 
default rule is that the patients will be treated as “no events”.  

−  Continuous data: The analyses and summaries for variables with continuous scales will be 
based on observed data only. However, the number of patients with missing observations 
will be provided

Version number: 1 (electronic 3.0) 

−  Time-to-event data: Missing outcomes due to different reasons will be handled using 

different censoring rules. The censoring rules are specified as part of the definition of the 
analysis variables.  

•  Analysis windows: For summaries about AE, exposure and tumor assessments, Cycles based 

on CRF data will be used. For certain other measurements such as Vital signs, a window 
defined around the date of treatment may be considered. Details will be provided in the SAP. 

13.6 

INTERIM ANALYSIS 

The objective of the interim analysis is to provide a methodological rationale and decision rules to 
the members of the DMC to either recommend to continue the study as planned or to stop earlier 
the study because of already demonstrated efficacy given the pre-specified α-spending O’Brien 
Fleming boundaries or because of futility boundaries crossing. Further details will be provided in 
the DMC charter. 

The interim analysis of OS is planned to stop for futility or overwhelming efficacy when 
approximately 205 OS events (40% information fraction) have occurred. The one-sided nominal 
significance level will be 0.0004 based on a O’Brien-Fleming α-spending function. If the p-value 
of the one-sided logrank test is <0.0004 at the time of interim analysis, considerations should be 
given to stop the trial for overwhelming efficacy of aflibercept + gemcitabine versus placebo + 
gemcitabine. Futility boundary, based on a Gamma(-4) β-spending function, will be crossed if the 
hazard ratio is ≥ 1.05 in favor of the gemcitabine plus placebo arm.   

13.7  CLINICAL STUDY REPORT ANALYSES 

The clinical study report will be issued with all data collected up to the end of the cycle 
ongoing on 11 September 2009. The patients continuing to receive study treatment will be 
identified and will continue to provide limited safety data for result reporting. The limited 
data collection (ie, at least serious adverse events, and reason for end of treatment) will 
ultimately be added to the clinical study report following the termination of these patients 
from the study.  This re-exposure data from these patients will be added as an addendum to 
the clinical study report in the form of at least updated patient listings and updated patient 
narrative.

21  SPONSOR AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS BY REGULATORY 

AGENCIES 

For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Clinical Trial Protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
and applicable regulatory requirements, the Investigator should permit auditing by or on the 
behalf of the Sponsor and inspection by regulatory authorities. 

The Investigator agrees to allow the auditors/inspectors to have direct access to his/her study 
records for review, being understood that this personnel is bound by professional secrecy, and as 
such will not disclose any personal identity or personal medical information. 

The Investigator will make every effort to help with the performance of the audits and inspections, 
giving access to all necessary facilities, data, and documents. 

As soon as the Investigator is notified of a planned inspection by the authorities, he will inform 
the Sponsor and authorize the Sponsor to participate in this inspection. 

The confidentiality of the data verified and the protection of the patients should be respected 
during these inspections. 

Any result and information arising from the inspections by the regulatory authorities will be 
immediately communicated by the Investigator to the Sponsor. 

The Investigator shall take appropriate measures required by the Sponsor to take corrective 
actions for all problems found during the audit or inspections.

24  PUBLICATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS 

The Investigator undertakes not to make any publication or release pertaining to the Study 
and/or results of the Study the sponsor’s prior written consent, being understood that the 
sponsor will not unreasonably withhold its approval. 

If the Study is being conducted at multiple sites, the Sponsor agrees that, consistent with 
scientific standards, first presentation or publication of the results of the Study shall be 
made only as part of a publication of the results obtained by all sites performing the 
Protocol. However, if no multicenter publication has occurred within twelve (12) months of 
the completion of this Study at all sites, the investigator shall have the right to publish or 
present independently the results of this Study patient to the review procedure set forth 
herein.  

The Investigator shall provide the Sponsor with a copy of any such presentation or 
publication derived from the Study for review and comment at least thirty (30) days in 
advance of any presentation or submission for publication. In addition, if requested by the 
sponsor, any presentation or submission for publication shall be delayed for a limited time, 
not to exceed ninety (90) days, to allow for filing of a patent application or such other 
measures as the Sponsor deems appropriate to establish and preserve its proprietary rights.  

If the study is conducted with the support of a Steering Committee, the latter may define 
specific rules for publication. 

The Investigator shall not use the name(s) of the Sponsor and/or its employees in advertising or 
promotional material or publication without the prior written consent of the Sponsor. The Sponsor 
shall not use the name(s) of the Investigator and/or the collaborators in advertising or promotional 
material or publication without having received his/her and/or their prior written consent(s). 

The Sponsor has the right at any time to publish the results of the study. 

For the main publication, authors ranking will be based on the number of eligible patients 
included by centers (only 1 author per center) and the principal investigator will be at least the last 
author.

25  CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 

All appendices attached hereto and referred to herein are made part of this Clinical Trial Protocol. 

The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the Clinical Trial 
Protocol without agreement by the Sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favorable 
opinion from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to Clinical Trial Patients, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the trial. Any change agreed upon will be recorded in writing, the 
written amendment will be signed by the Investigator and by the Sponsor and the signed 
amendment will be filed with this Clinical Trial Protocol. 

Any amendment to the Clinical Trial Protocol requires written approval/favorable opinion by the 
Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) prior to its implementation, unless there are overriding safety 
reasons. 

In some instances, an amendment may require a change to the Informed Consent Form. The 
Investigator must receive an IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion concerning the revised 
Informed Consent Form prior to implementation of the change.

Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) quick 
reference (41) 

Eligibility 
•  Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where 

objective tumor response is the primary endpoint. 

Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is 
restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology. 

Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
longest diameter ≥20 mm using conventional techniques or ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan. 

Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm 
with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by 
imaging techniques; and 
•  All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. 

All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 

•  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 

identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 

•  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 

Methods of Measurement 
•  CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target 

lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with 
cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 
mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen and 
pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols. 

•  Lesions on chest X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and 

surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. 

•  When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) 

should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical 
measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. 
US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually 
assessed by clinical examination.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 2 
EFC10547 
•  The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been 
fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment 
and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, the 
utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation 
purposes in specialized centers. However, such techniques can be useful in confirming 
complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained. 

•  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response when all lesions have disappeared. 

•  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., 

after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions 
in tumor types such as germ cell tumors). 

Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” lesions 
•  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 

representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. 

•  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) 

and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or 
clinically). 

•  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the 
objective tumor. 

•  All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also 

be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 

Response Criteria 
 

Complete Response (CR) 
Partial Response (PR) 

Progressive Disease (PD) 

Stable disease (SD) 

Evaluation of target lesions 
Disappearance of all target lesions 
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD 
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to quality for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started

Evaluation of non-target lesions 

Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level 
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits 
Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions1 

1 Although a clear progression of “non target” lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician. Should 
prevail and the progression status should be confirmed later on by the review panel (or study chairmen). 
 

Evaluation of best overall response 

The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). In general, the patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

•  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 

without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the complete 
response status. 

• 

Confirmation 
•  The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response 
rate observed. In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear 
when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. 

•  To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 

repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for

• 

response are first met. Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol may also be 
appropriate. 
In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after 
study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6-8 weeks) that is defined in the 
study protocol 

Duration of overall response 
•  The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for 

CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is 
objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started. 

Duration of stable disease 
•  SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are 

met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
•  The clinical relevance of the duration of SD varies for different tumor types and grades. 
Therefore, it is highly recommended that the protocol specify the minimal time interval 
required between two measurements for determination of SD. This time interval should take 
into account the expected clinical benefit that such a status may bring to the population under 
study. 

Response review 
•  For trials where the response rate is the primary endpoint it is strongly recommended that all 

responses be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study’s completion. 
Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images is the best approach. 

Reporting of results 
•  All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned one 
of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) 
early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). 

•  All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main analysis of 

the response rate. Patients in response categories 4-9 should be considered as failing to 
respond to treatment (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Precise 
definitions for categories 4-9 will be protocol specific. 
•  All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. 
•  Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for 
whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, 
early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.). However, these

subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, 
and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported. 

•  The 95% confidence intervals should be provided.

Adverse Events  

 
- Toxicity grade should reflect the most severe degree occurring during the evaluated period, not 
an average. 
- When 2 criteria are available for similar toxicities, the one resulting in the more severe grade 
should be used. 
- The evaluator must attempt to discriminate between disease / treatment and related signs / 
symptoms. 
- An accurate baseline prior to therapy is essential.

Clinical Evaluation of Pain Severity 
Instructions: If you have had no pain during the past 24-hours, you may circle the words “No Pain” or make an “X” at the very 
left end of the scale. If your average pain during the past 24-hours has been Worst Possible Pain, you may circle the words “Worst 
Possible Pain” or make an “X” at the very right end of the scale. If your average pain has been between these two extremes, make 
an “X” on the line somewhere between the two ends, indicating the average severity of your pain during the past 24-hours. 
Place an “X” on the line that shows what your pain was like, on average, over the past 24-hours.

Specialized blood sample collection, handling and shipping  

Recommended methods for pharmacokinetic, the assay of free endogenous VEGF and anti- 
aflibercept antibody blood sample collection and handling 

Since study treatment is administered intravenously, blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis 
should not be collected from the arm where study treatment is infused, or from a central line used 
for study treatment administration. For samples collected through a catheter, 1 mL of blood 
should be withdrawn and discarded at each sampling time to ensure that the solution used to 
maintain catheter patency does not dilute the blood sample. 

It is extremely important to collect all blood samples as close to the protocol-specified times as 
possible. The reasons for any missed or lost blood samples should be documented. Both the 
scheduled and actual dates/times of blood collection should appear on the blood collection record 
at the study site. The times of aflibercept administration should also be precisely recorded. 

Blood collection for aflibercept pharmacokinetic analysis in CTAD plasma 

At the protocol-specified intervals indicated in Sections 9.3, “CTAD” vacutainer tubes 
(containing 1 mL of citrate buffer, sodium citrate, and 4.2 mg of citric acid) will be used to collect 
4 mL of whole blood from patients for plasma preparation for the determination of circulating free 
aflibercept and VEGF: aflibercept complex levels for pharmacokinetic analysis. 

Because platelet lysis can release VEGF into the serum and possibly affect aflibercept 
measurements, it is important to carefully follow the steps outlined below: 
1.  Draw blood slowly, using the largest-bore catheter that is feasible for the patient and transfer 
blood to a CTAD vacutainer tube (B-D Hemogard, sedimentation rate determination 4.5 mL 
tubes), being careful to minimize agitation of the sample. 

2.  gently mix tube by inverting 4 times. 
3.  Centrifuge at 2000 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature within 1 hour of blood draw. 
4.  Within 30 minutes after centrifugation, draw off plasma very slowly with transfer pipette to 

within 0.5 cm of the buffy coat, taking great care not to disturb the buffy coat (any 
contamination may invalidate the assay). 

5.  Pipette the plasma specimen into two separate plastic cryovials. 
6.  Complete corresponding lines for each blood draw on the shipping log. Include patient 

identification number, initials, and date of specimen collection. 

7.  All specimens must be stored frozen at -20°C (or colder) in a freezer that is not frost-free until 

shipped to Regeneron. 

8.  The Regeneron Specimen Log Sheets must be completed and included along with all 

shipments to Regeneron.

duplicates are available at the site for backup in case of damage during shipment. 
10. On the day specimens will be shipped, please notify Regeneron to expect arrival.  

Sufficient dry ice is to be included for samples to remain frozen for at least 48 hours (recommend 
at least 14 lbs. of dry ice). 

For free aflibercept and VEGF: aflibercept complex assays, the transport of plasma samples from 
the clinical site to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will take place in containers of solid CO2 and 
be coordinated with: 

 

 

 

 

Blood collection  for Anti- Aflibercept Antibody analysis 

At the protocol-specified intervals indicated in Sections 9.3, red-top vacutainer tubes without clot 
activator will be used to collect 4 mL of whole blood from patients for serum preparation for the 
analysis of anti-aflibercept antibodies formation. The following procedures should be followed: 
1.  Complete the pre-printed labels with Investigator’s name, patient identification numbers, 

initials and date of specimen collection. 

2.  Allow serum to clot for 30 minutes. Spin at 2000 x g for 15 minutes to separate clot from 

serum. 

3.  Pipette the serum specimen into two separate plastic cryovials (supplied by Regeneron 

Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). 

4.  Complete corresponding lines for each blood draw on the shipping log. Include: patient 

identification number, initials, date of specimen collection. 

5.  All specimens must be stored frozen at -20°C (or colder) until shipped to the laboratory 

designated by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

6.  The Specimen Log Sheet must be completed and included along with all shipments. 
7.  Only the primary samples of each patient should be sent with the first shipment. This is to 
ensure that in case of damage during shipment there are duplicates at the site for backup.
