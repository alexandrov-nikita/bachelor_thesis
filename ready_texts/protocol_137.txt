STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD 
(per subject) 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

A 2-step design approach will be used according to the 
O'Brien and Fleming method: 
 
-  Interim  analysis  of  RR  on  the 

 
 
 

 

 
- Final analysis: 
 

1) Grade 3-4 Neurotoxicity :  

 

 

 

Incidence  of  Grade  3-4  neurotoxicity  will  be 
studied according to the oxaliplatin cumulative dose 
at  neurotoxicity  onset  using  the  life  table  method. 
Comparison  will  be  performed  using  a  2-sided 
logrank test, with a type I error of 0.05. 
 
2) Response Rate 

  

Non-inferiority  of  RR  will  be  demonstrated  if  the 
lower bound of the 95 % confidence interval of the 
ratio of RR is at least 0.80 and using a type I error 
of 0.048 (after taking in account the alpha-spending 
of the interim analysis). 

 
•  Therapy  will  consist  of  2-week  treatment  cycles 

and may last up to 1 year. 

•  Post  treatment  observation  for  treatment-related 
toxicities (including neurotoxicity) for  two months 
after the 30 days  post chemotherapy visit. 

•  Patients will be followed for progression, regardless 
of  the  number  of  cycles  received,  until  it  is 
documented or for 13 months after the first dose of 
study drug, whichever comes first. 

•  Patients with PD at any point during the study will 
receive  no  additional  study  treatment  under  this 
protocol.    Objective  evidence  of  the  timing  and 
extent of progressive disease will be recorded at the 
time of progression.

1.  INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 

 
1.1 Background & Rationale 

The  limiting  factor  of  chemotherapy  is  the  narrow  therapeutic  index.  Improving  the 
therapeutic index may be achieved through the use of agents protecting the normal tissue. 
These  agents  should  reduce  the  toxicity  without  compromising  tumor  cytotoxicity;  in 
addition  they  should  not  be  associated  with  other  toxicities  that might  interfere  with  the 
adequate delivery of the chemotherapy. 
 
Oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m² IV  2-hour on day 1 repeated every 2 weeks, in combination with 
5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin  (5-FU  /LV)  (bolus  +  infusion  days1-2  de  Gramont  regimen  : 
FOLFOX4), is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with Metastatic Colorectal 
Cancer (MCRC)  (see Appendix 1 : Summary of data and guidance for the investigator). 
A Response Rate (RR)  of 49.0% [42.1 – 56.1], a median Progression Free Survival (PFS)  
of 8.1 months [7.2 – 8.8] and a median Overall Survival (OS)  of 15.9 months are achieved 
with  this  chemotherapy  regimen  with  a  median  of  12  cycles/6  months  of  treatment  per 
patient (median cumulative dose of oxaliplatin : 837 mg/m²). 
The  dose-limiting  toxicity  of  oxaliplatin  is  a  cumulative  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy 
characterized  in  its  severe  form  by  distal  paresthesias  persisting  in-between  cycles  of 
treatment  with  occurrence  of  functional  disorders  affecting  daily  life  activities  such  as 
buttoning  (oxaliplatin  specific  neurotoxicity  scale  grade  3-4).  At  the  recommended dose 
and schedule of administration the cumulative incidence of severe neuropathy is 15 - 20% 
of patients, the median cumulative dose to onset being 874 mg/m² (10-11 cycles or at least 
5  months  of  full dose  treatment). Overall, the risk of experiencing a grade 3 neuropathy 
(cumulative probability) is about 18% of patients after a cumulative dose of 1000 mg/m² 
(12 cycles – 6 months of treatment) (or by class of cumulative doses: 850 to 1200 mg/m² - 
10 to 14 cycles at 85 mg/m² q 2 w). 
 
Xaliproden  is  an  orally  active  non-peptide  neurotrophic  and  neuroprotective  agent.  The 
mechanism  of  action,  although  not  fully  elucidated,  indicates  the  ability  to  minimize 
experimentally-induced degeneration of neurons. 
In vitro data suggest that xaliproden has a neuroprotective potential against chemotherapy 
induced peripheral neuropathy. 
Phase III clinical trials have shown the activity of xaliproden in patients with Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) at the dose of 1 or 2mg/day for up to 18 months, with the greatest 
effect observed at 1 mg/day in a pooled analysis of 2 trials. The main treatment-emergent 
adverse events (AEs)  (in excess of at least 2% as compared to the placebo group) with an 
apparent  dose-effect  were  :  insomnia,  nausea,  dizziness,  diarrhea,  paresthesias,  asthenia, 
fatigue,  vomiting,  vertigo,  tinnitus.  These  AEs  were  non  serious  in  nature,  rarely  led  to 
treatment  discontinuation  and  were  consistent  with  the  serotoninergic  properties  of  the

compound. Apart from an effect on glycemia (increased glycemia), the laboratory safety 
of xaliproden was satisfactory.

1.2.2 Preclinical data 

 
 
Xaliproden  is  an  orally  active  non-peptide  neurotrophic  and  neuroprotective  agent.  The 
mechanism of action of xaliproden has not been fully elucidated but results from a variety 
of lesion models of central and peripheral nervous system disorders indicate its ability to 
minimize experimentally induced degeneration of neurons. These data along with results 
of  in  vitro  models  for  neurotrophic  effects  suggest  that  xaliproden  either  mimics  or 
enhances the effects of naturally-occurring protein neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF …) which 
influence  the  development  and/or  repair  of  neurons.  Xaliproden  is  also  an  agonist  of  5-
HT1A receptors.

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

The  effect  of  xaliproden  on  sensorimotor  nerve  regeneration  was  evaluated  in  vivo  in 
acrylamide-induced  peripheral  neuropathy  in  rats.  In  vehicle-treated  animals,  acrylamide 
administration leads to a neuronal lesions which develop after several weeks of treatment 
into a paralysis of the posterior limbs. Motor function recovers gradually after withdrawal 
of the toxin, but recovery is not complete even 4 weeks after the last acrylamide injection. 
In rats administered xaliproden (3 to 10 mg/kg p.o. daily), the first signs of motor deficits 
appeared later than in vehicle-treated animals, the evolution of the deficits was slower, and 
their amplitude less important. Motor performance was also significantly improved during 
the  recovery  period  in  rats  treated  with  xaliproden  compared  to  that  in  vehicle-treated 
animals.  When  xaliproden  was  first  administered  at  later  times  during  the  acrylamide 
treatment (just before the start of the motor deficits ; just after their onset ; or at their peak 
occurrence), the compound was still able to reduce the motor deficits. 
 
In vitro the neuroprotective properties of xaliproden were studied in co-cultures of dorsal 
root  ganglia  (DRG)  and  Schwann  cells,  in  which  neuritogenesis  was  reduced  by  the 
cytostatic drugs cisplatin, vincristine and taxol. It was found that neurite outgrowth from 
DRG treated with cisplatin (3 µg/ml) and 10 µM xaliproden or oxaliplatin 5 µM and 3 µM 
xaliproden  (internal  note  dated  30/Jan/02)  for  3  days  was  significantly  higher  than  after 
treatment with either one of the two platinium-based drugs alone. Similarly, neuritogenesis 
from DRG treated with taxol (0.01 µg/ml) or vincristine (0.5 ng/ml) in combination with 
10  µM  xaliproden  was  significantly  increased  compared  to  treatment  with  taxol  or 
vincristine alone (1). 
 
Xaliproden (10 µM) did not impair in vitro the antiproliferative activity of taxol, cisplatin 
or oxaliplatin on the hormono-independent human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB/231. 
 
Xaliproden did not affect in vitro the growth or the proliferation of human leukemia cell 
lines  (internal  report  IVT007,  IVT008),  did  not  modify  the  blastic  transformation  of 
human  peripheral  blood  leukocytes  (IVT0006)  and  did  not  induce  DNA  synthesis  in 
quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells (IVT0005). Furthermore, xaliproden (10 mg/kg/day p.o.) did not 
affect the survival of mice inoculated i.p. with P388 murine leukemia cells (IVV002). 
 
All these findings indicate that xaliproden could be useful for the prevention and recovery 
from  neuropathies  induced  by  oncolytic  agents  without  compromising  their  tumor 
cytotoxicity 
 
1.2.3 Pharmacokinetic properties 

Xaliproden is well absorbed by the oral route, pharmacokinetics are linear at doses ranging 
from  0.5  to  2  mg  daily  and  food  does  not  significantly  modify  the  extent  of  absorption 
(Tmax delayed by 3 hours, from 2 to 5 hours).  
Xaliproden is widely distributed in the body (apparent distribution volume > 500 L) and is 
highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%), mainly albumin; no saturation at concentrations 
far above those achieved at the recommended dose (i.e. 1 mg daily) is observed. 

 

17/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

Xaliproden is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Xaliproden is excreted in the faeces and 
urine mainly as metabolites. 
In extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, the mean apparent plasma clearance is 2 L/h and the 
elimination  half-life  is  approximately  15  days.  Steady  state  plasma  concentrations  are 
generally obtained after 2 months and are approximately 5-fold higher than those observed 
after a single dose administration. 
In poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, steady state plasma concentrations are generally obtained 
after  6  months  and  are  approximately  2.4-fold  higher  than  those  observed  in  extensive 
metabolizers. 
When  co-administered  with  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitors  such  as  fluoxetine,  xaliproden 
plasma levels are in average 3.1-fold higher than those observed when administered alone. 
Since xaliproden is well tolerated in poor metabolizers, the increase in plasma levels due 
to the co-administration with CYP2D6-inhibitor drugs (see Appendix 2) is not expected to 
have clinical relevance.  
Based  on  in-vitro  data,  xaliproden  is  not  expected  to  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
drug  primarily  metabolized  by  CYP1A2,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2E1  or  CYP3A4. 
Xaliproden  may  increase  plasma  levels  of  drugs  primarily  metabolized  by  CYD2D6. 
However, maximum therapeutic xaliproden concentrations expected after 1 or 2 mg dose 
(i.e. < 0.5 µg/ml) are 8-fold lower than the inhibitory constant. 
Since  oxaliplatin  does  not  significantly  inhibit  cytochrome  P450  activity  in  vitro, 
metabolically  mediated  drug-drug  interactions  of  oxaliplatin  and  xaliproden  are  not 
anticipated. 
An in vivo healthy volunteer study demonstrated that xaliproden administered for 7 days, 
did not affect prothrombin time or the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. 
 
1.2.4 Preclinical safety data (toxicology) 

Xaliproden has no mutagenic or genotoxic activity. 
Reproductive  toxicity  in  rats  and  rabbits:  a  no-effect  level  could  not  be  established  for 
maternal  or  embryo-fetal  toxicity.  Studies  in  mice  and  rats  have  shown  that  xaliproden 
and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. 
 
Sub acute and chronic toxicity : studies in rodents and baboons showed lesions suggestive 
of sphingolipidosis in viscera and brain. Lesions are thought to result from a pronounced 
and prolonged inhibition of glucosylceramidase activity leading to a toxic accumulation of 
its substrate, glucosylceramide in macrophage of viscera, or glucosylsphingosine in brain. 

1.2.5 Clinical safety data 

Three ALS trials of 18 months duration, involving 1484 patients taking xaliproden 1 or 2 
mg  daily,  have  been  completed.  In  the  ALS  dossier,  1mg  daily  is  the  proposed 
recommended dose based on both efficacy and safety considerations.   
 
Adverse drug reactions of xaliproden were determined based on an excess incidence of ≥ 
2%  compared  to  placebo  in  the  pooled  data  from  the  3  clinical  trials  as  shown  in  the 
Table (1.2.5) 1.

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

An  analysis  of  the  time  to  onset  and  duration  of  xaliproden-related  AEs  has  shown  the 
following : 
•  Dizziness,  nausea  and  vomiting  were  observed  very  shortly  after  the  initiation  of 

treatment and lasted only 2 to 3 days. 

•  Tinnitus  and  paresthesias  (ie  :  tingling  sensation,  formication)  had  a  longer  time  to 

onset: about 3 weeks after treatment initiation, but also lasted only 2 to 3 days. 

•  Diarrhea  median  time  to onset was within 2 to 3 months of xaliproden treatment and 

the median duration of episodes was again 2 to 3 days. 
Overall,  these  AEs  were  consistent  in  nature  with  the  serotoninergic  properties  of 
xaliproden, of short duration and had no impact on the continuation of treatment (they 
led to treatment discontinuation for 0 to 0.4% of the patients). They resolved although 
xaliproden  treatment  continued,  suggesting  the  development  of  a  tolerance  to  these 
effects under treatment with xaliproden. 

•  Insomnia was observed after several weeks of xaliproden treatment, more rapidly at the 
higher dose of xaliproden (i.e. median time to onset during the 3 week of treatment for 
xaliproden  2  mg  daily)  and  tended  to  continue  throughout  treatment  leading  to 
discontinuation in only 0.4% of patients in the 1 mg daily group, 0.3% each in the 2 mg 
and placebo groups, respectively. 

-  Because the observed incidence of hyperglycemia (serotoninergic property) was higher 
for patients treated with xaliproden (6.5% in the 1 mg group) than in the placebo group, 
the diabetogenic potential of xaliproden from the ALS trials pooled data was assessed : 
De novo diabetes incidence was similar in both placebo and xaliproden 1 mg groups, 
no  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  diabetes  mellitus  was  reported  in  non-diabetic 
patient.  Mean  glucose  levels  and  mean  glycated  hemoglobin  levels  changes  between 
baseline  and  at  18  months  on-study  showed  higher  mean  values  in  both  xaliproden 
groups  as  compared  with  placebo.  However,  in  diabetic  patients  treated  with 
xaliproden,  increases  in  glucose  and  in  glycated  hemoglobin  levels  were  observed. 
Therefore  a  monitoring  of  glucose  levels  in  the  present  clinical  trial  is  planned. 
Adjustment  of  the  anti-diabetic  treatment  for  diabetic  patients  under  study  if 
hyperglycemia is observed, should be implemented. 

 
-  Edema events under xaliproden (pooled edema1 :  19.7% of patients in the 1 mg group, 

20.1% in 2 mg group; 15.8% in placebo) were found not to be of cardiac origin. 

-  Also, not shown in the table, about 10% of patients in each of the 3 groups, experienced 

allergy related AEs, such as eruption, enanthema, rashes, urticaria. 

 
-  In the 3 ALS trials, no consistent differences in the safety profile were found between 
poor and extensive metabolizers (28 patients in the 1 mg daily group and 24 patients in 
the  2  mg  group),  although  higher  plasma  concentrations  of  xaliproden  were  found  in 
poor metabolizers. Consistent with that finding, no pharmacokinetic (PK)  dependency

of the safety profile was evidenced. Also, the effect of concomitant exposure to either 
CYP2D6 inhibitor or substrate was analyzed in two ALS phase III trials.  

-  Although  unexpected,  a lower  (and  not  higher)  incidence of insomnia  and of  sensory 
disturbances (e.g. hyper/hypo/paresthesia, neuralgia) in patients treated with xaliproden 
was  observed  during  concomitant  administration of CYP2D6 inhibitor or substrate as 
compared to placebo. 

 
-  There were no xaliproden – related modifications of liver function tests, renal function 

or hematological parameters. 

 
-  There  was  no  evidence  of  either  inhibition  of  glucosylceramidase  activity  or  lesions 

such as those observed in animal toxicity studies (see  Clinical Investigator Brochure). 

 

2.  STUDY OBJECTIVES 

The present study of the addition of  xaliproden to the oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV combination 
treatment is aiming at reducing the oxaliplatin-induced cumulative peripheral neuropathy 
without compromising the activity/efficacy of the chemotherapy regimen in patients with 
MCRC. 
 
2.1 Primary 
•  Neuroprotection 
To  compare  the  incidence  per  patient  of  severe  oxaliplatin-induced  cumulative 
peripheral neurotoxicity (grade 3-4 specific scale) between : 

- 

- 

the control arm A : Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV (FOLFOX4) + placebo and 
the experimental arm B : Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV (FOLFOX4) + xaliproden 

in non-pretreated patients with MCRC. 
The  expected  risk  of  severe  neurotoxicity  in  the  control  arm  A  is  18%  of  patients  at  a 
cumulative dose of 1000 mg/m² - 12 cycles / 6 months of treatment [850 – 1200 mg/m², 10 
–  14  cycles].  If  a  risk  reduction  of  45%  in  the  experimental  arm  B  is  observed,  the 
incidence  of  severe  neurotoxicity  will  be  10%  for  patients  treated  with  xaliproden  in 
addition to the chemotherapy. 
 
•  Antitumoral efficacy : 
To  compare  the  Response  Rate  (RR)  between  the  control  arm  A  and  the 
experimental  arm  B  in  order  to  assure  that  the  efficacy  of  the  treatment  is  not 
compromised by the addition of xaliproden to the chemotherapy regimen. 
 
The expected RR in the control arm A is 49% with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)  [42% 
– 56%]. If non-inferiority in the experimental arm B, the lower bound of the 95% CI of the 
ratio of RR will be at least 0.80.

2.2 Secondary 

To evaluate for each of the treatment arm : 
 
•  The neurotoxicity : 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

-  Overall incidence per patient of peripheral neurotoxicity during treatment 
-  Time and dose to onset of peripheral neurotoxicity (grades 1, 2, 3-4) 
- 

Incidence of dose-reduction and dose-delay due to peripheral neurotoxicity 
Incidence of oxaliplatin treatment discontinuation due to peripheral neurotoxicity 

- 
-  Time to recovery (partial, complete) from grade 3-4 peripheral neurotoxicity  
-  Decrease of sensory action potential (Electromyography test) 
-  Neurotoxicity evaluation using the modified Norris Scale 

 

 

•  The antitumoral efficacy  :  

-  Progression  Free  Survival  (PFS).  The  expected  PFS  in  the  control  arm  A  is  8 

months [7 months – 9 months] 

-  Overall survival (OS) 

 
•  The Safety Profile (other than peripheral neurotoxicity) 
 

3.  STUDY DESIGN 

3.1 Description of the protocol 
•  This  is  a  randomized,  placebo  controlled,  2  armed    Phase  III  study  of  Xaliproden  in 
combination with Oxaliplatin + 5FU/LV in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  
It will be conducted at approximately 45 centers. 

•  After  50  eligible  patients  are  treated  and  evaluable  for  tumor  responses  in  arm  B,  a 
review of the number of responses and the safety will be performed. If the number of 
objective responses is less than 11, the hypothesis that the RR is greater than 40 % has 
a probability lower than 1% and the trial should stop for lack of efficacy. 

•  Description of the randomization method and treatment allocation procedure is located 

in section 5.6 of this protocol. 

 
3.2 Interim analysis 

Formal  Interim  Analysis  :  RR  comparison  between  the  2  arms  after  100  eligible 
patients  per  arm  are  treated  and  evaluable  for  response.  A  maximum  difference  of  18% 
between the control arm and the test arm should be observed in order to continue the trial. 
At this occasion a review of the safety profile will also be undertaken.

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

3.3 Study committees : Independent Data Monitoring Committee 

An  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)    will  be  set  up  to  review  trial 
enrolment, safety and efficacy data of the administered treatments.  The IDMC will consist 
of three external independent members (2 physicians and 1 biostatistician) not associated 
with  the  conduct  of  the  study.    This  committee  will  convene  at  least  every 6  months to 
review  safety  (toxicities  including  peripheral  neurotoxicity,  treatment  exposure,  SAEs 
including  the  rate  of  deaths  on  study  i.e.  within  30  days  of  last  chemotherapy 
administration)  and  other  issues  related  to  the  appropriate  conduct  of  the  trial.  In 
particular,  it  will  be  in  charge  of  examining  the  results  after  the  50  first  eligible  and 
evaluable patients in arm B and the results of the formal interim analysis on RR.  
 
Statistical listings, tables and analyses will be performed on unblinded data by an external 
statistician who will provide the results to the independent committee. The Sponsor will 
provide  blinded  data  to  the  external  statistician  and  will  not  participate  in  the  interim 
reviews/analyses. 

 

3.4 Duration of study participation 

Therapy will consist of 2-week treatment cycles for up to 1 year.  Patients should receive 
at  least  6  months  of  treatment  unless  disease  progression  or  unacceptable  toxicity  is 
observed. 
 
Observation  for  treatment-related  toxicity  (including  neurological  toxicity)  will  be  for  2 
months  after  30  days  following  the  last  dose  of  oxaliplatin  (Day  30  post  chemotherapy 
visit).  Follow-up  visits  will be  performed  each  month  for  two months after Day 30 post 
chemotherapy  visit.  Observation  may  continue  if  neurological  symptoms  have  not 
resolved by the two months post Day 30 visit. 
 
Patients  with  progressive  disease  (PD)    at  any  point  during  the  study  will  discontinue 
study treatment under this protocol. Objective evidence of PD will be recorded at the time 
of  progression.    Patients  without  evidence  of  progression,  regardless  of  the  number  of 
treatment cycles received, will be followed for progression until it is documented or for 13 
months after their first dose of study drug, whichever comes first, by CT  or MRI  scans 
every 2 months.   
After  PD  has  been  documented  and  after  the  follow-up  visits  have  been  completed, 
patients will be followed every 3 months, for neurotoxicity resolution -if applicable- and  
for survival.

Co-administration of leucovorin 
For simultaneous administration of oxaliplatin and leucovorin, separate infusion bags and 
lines must be used with Y-tubing connecting the 2 lines before the single injection site. 
 
Incompatibilities 
Do not combine with alkaline medications or media, which cause oxaliplatin to degrade.  
Do  not  administer  simultaneously  by  the  same  line.    Flush  line  after  oxaliplatin 
administration.   
 
Do not use preparation or administration needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum

Placebo  or  Xaliproden  daily  from  day  1  of  the  first  planned  chemotherapy  treatment 
cycle through the end of the last cycle with oxaliplatin 
 

  

Study treatment administration is to begin within 7 days after randomization. 

 
 
5.4 Guidelines for treatment modifications  

   

Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI  Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), Version 
2.0  (Appendix  5).  Neurosensory  toxicity  will  be  graded  according  to  the  Neurologic 
Toxicity  Scale  for  Oxaliplatin  Dose  Adjustments.  Patients  experiencing  serious  adverse 
events will be followed as described in section 7.1 
 
Reason(s)  for  dose  modifications  or  delays,  the  supportive  measures  taken,  and  the 
outcome will be documented in medical record. 
 
Xaliproden should be taken daily whatever chemotherapy dose reductions or delays are. 
Hyperglycemia under Xaliproden should lead to adjustment of concomitant treatment – if 
any - and follow up of glycemia should be implemented. Xaliproden will be stopped when 
the decision is taken to permanently discontinue the chemotherapy under study.  
 
 
 
5.4.1 Chemotherapy treatment delay 

Chemotherapy will be delayed until: 
 
•  Neutrophil count is ≥1.5 X 109/L and platelet count is ≥75 X 109/L  
•  Recovery from stomatitis or diarrhea to Grade 1 or less 
•  Recovery from skin toxicity to Grade 1 or less (see skin toxicity) 
•  Recovery from fatigue to Grade 2 or less. 
 
If  toxicity  requires  treatment  to  be  delayed  more  than  2  weeks  after  the  next  scheduled 
cycle of treatment during the first 6 months of treatment, the patient will be permanently 
withdrawn from treatment. For patients who remain on treatment for more than 6 months 
and  who  experience  toxicity  requiring  a  single  dosing delay  of  more  than  4  consecutive 
weeks, a q3 weeks  dosing schedule may be implemented. 
 
If  5-FU/LV  treatment  is  delayed,  then  the  associated  oxaliplatin  dose  should  also  be 
delayed.    If  5-FU/LV  treatment  is  permanently  discontinued,  single-agent  oxaliplatin 
treatment may be continued.  
 

 

28/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

For patients who have had dosing delays, all evaluations, including tumor evaluation, will 
be  correspondingly  delayed (with the exception of a confirming scan to be performed at 
least 4 weeks, but not more than 6 weeks, after the scan showing a response to treatment).   
 
5.4.2 Dose reductions 

5.4.2.1 Dose reduction for Hematologic toxicity : 

Dose modifications of oxaliplatin and 5FU/LV for hematologic toxicity will be based on 
the most severe toxicity observed during the previous cycle. 
 
• 

No  dose  modification  will  be  required  for  changes  in  hemoglobin  or  leukocyte 
counts. Blood transfusions should be carefully recorded. 
No dose modifications will be required for toxicity Grades 1 or 2. 
For Grade 4 neutropenia or Grade 3 or 4 Thrombocytopenia, the bolus 5-FU dose 
will  be  reduced  to  300  mg/m2/day,  the  5-FU  infusion  will  be  reduced  to  500 
mg/m2/day, the dose of oxaliplatin will be reduced to 65 mg/m2. 
For Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia, the bolus 5-FU dose will be reduced to 300 
mg/m2/day,  the  5-FU  infusion  will  be  reduced  to  500  mg/m2/day,  and  the  dose of 
oxaliplatin will be reduced to 65 mg/m2.

5.4.2.2 Dose Reduction for Non-Hematologic toxicities 

Based  on  the  most  severe  toxicity  experienced  since  the  last  cycle,  the  following  dose 
modifications  should  be  used  for  non-hematologic  toxicities.  Re-treatment  should  be 
delayed  until  all  non-hematologic  toxicities  have  subsided  to  Grade  2  or  less,  except 
stomatitis, diarrhea, and skin toxicity than should have subsided to Grade 1 or less. 
Treatment may be delayed up to 2 weeks after the next scheduled cycle of treatment to 
allow for this recovery. If the patient cannot meet the re-treatment criteria, in this 
timeframe, he/she will be taken off protocol treatment.

Nausea and Vomiting 
For  Grade  3  nausea  and/or  vomiting  that  occur  with  sub-optimal  anti-emetic  therapy, 
treatment should be continued for the next course with an effective anti-emetic treatment 
and  without  dose  modification.  If  Grade  4  vomiting  occurs  at  any  time  or  if  Grade  3 
nausea and/or vomiting persist in the next cycle, the dose of bolus 5-FU will be reduced to 
300  mg/m2/day,  the  5-FU  infusion  will  be  reduced  to  500  mg/m2/day,  and  the  dose  of 
oxaliplatin will be reduced to 65 mg/m2 
 
Diarrhea 
For Grade 3 diarrhea that occurs with sub-optimal anti-diarrheal therapy, treatment should 
be  continued  for  the  next  course  with  an  effective  anti-diarrheal  therapy  without  dose 
modification. If Grade 4 diarrhea occurs at any time or if Grade 3 diarrhea persists in the 
next cycle, the dose of bolus 5-FU will be reduced to 300 mg/m2/day, the 5-FU infusion 
will be reduced to 500 mg/m2/day and oxaliplatin will be reduced to 65 mg/m2. 
After  Grade  3  or  4  diarrhea,  the  patient  must  have  recovered  to  Grade  1  or  less  before 
treatment can be re- initiated. 
 
Stomatitis 
For Grade 3 stomatitis the dose of bolus 5-FU will be reduced to 300 mg/m2/day and the 5-
FU infusion will be reduced to 500 mg/m2/day. For Grade 4 stomatitis the dose of bolus 5-
FU  will  be  reduced  to  200  mg/m2/day  and  the  5-FU  infusion  will  be  reduced  to  400 
mg/m2/day. Oxaliplatin will be reduced to 65 mg/m2for Grade 4 stomatitis. After Grade 3 
or 4 stomatitis, the patient must have recovered to Grade 1 or less before treatment can be 
re-initiated. 
 
Cardiac toxicity 
For  Grade  ≥  2  cardiac  toxicity  which  is  clearly  attributable  to  5-FU,  patients  will  be 
permanently discontinued form 5-FU/LV therapy but may continue to receive oxaliplatin. 
 
Skin toxicity 
Treatment will be held for Grade 3 or 4 toxicity until recovery to Grade 1. Upon recovery 
from  Grade 3  or  4  toxicity,  bolus 5-FU will be reduced to 200 mg/m2/day and the 5-FU 
infusion will be reduced to 300 mg/m2/day. Oxaliplatin will not be dose reduced for skin 
toxicities.

The neurotoxicity includes paresthesias and dysesthesias of the hands, feet, and peri-oral 
region.    Patients  treated  with  oxaliplatin  in  this  study  will  be  counseled  to  avoid  cold 
drinks  and  exposure  to  cold  water  or  air,  especially  for  3-5  days  following  oxaliplatin 
administration. 
 
5.4.2.4 Laryngopharyngeal dysesthesias 

An  unusual  laryngopharyngeal  dysesthesia:  a  loss  of  sensation  of  breathing  (acute 
respiratory  distress)  without  any  objective  evidence  of  respiratory  distress  (hypoxia, 
laryngospasm,  or  bronchospasm)  also  has  been  observed.    This  neurotoxicity  may  be 
induced or exacerbated upon exposure to cold. 
 
Should  a  patient  develop  laryngopharyngeal  dysesthesia,  the  patient's  oxygen  saturation 
will  be  evaluated  via  a  pulse  oximeter  and,  if  normal,  an  anxiolytic  agent  or 
benzodiazepine  will  be  given  and  the  patient  should  be  observed  in  the  clinic  until  the 
episode has resolved.  The infusion may then be continued at 1/3 the rate.  Because this 
syndrome may be associated with the rapidity of oxaliplatin infusion, subsequent doses of 
oxaliplatin  should  be  administered  as  6-hour  infusions  (instead  of  the  normal  2-hour 
infusion).

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

5.4.2.5 Oral cryotherapy 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

Patients on oxaliplatin should not receive oral cryotherapy (such as ice chips) on Day 1 of 
each  cycle  as  this  may  exacerbate  oral  or  throat  dysesthesias,  and  laryngopharyngeal 
dysesthesia.   
 
5.4.2.6 Allergic Reactions 

For  Grade  1  or 2  acute  hypersensitivity  reactions,  no  dose modification  of  oxaliplatin is 
required  if,  in  the  Investigator’s  opinion,  it  is  in  the  patient’s  best  interest  to  continue.  
Pre-medication with dexamethasone 20 mg IV, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and one of the 
following:    cimetidine  300 mg  IV,  ranitidine  50 mg  IV,  or  famotidine  20  mg  IV 
30 minutes  prior  to  study  drug  administration  is  recommended.    If  an  allergic  reaction 
persists  into  the  next  cycle,  administer  50  mg  dexamethasone  PO  12 hours  and  6  hours 
prior to administration of oxaliplatin.   
 
For Grade 3 or 4 acute hypersensitivity reactions, treatment should be discontinued. 
 
5.4.2.7 Pulmonary fibrosis 

In the case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as nonproductive cough, dyspnea, 
crackles  or  radiological  pulmonary  infiltrates,  oxaliplatin  should  be  discontinued  until 
further investigations exclude interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. 
 
5.4.2.8 Other toxicities or miscellaneous events 

Other  toxicities  or  miscellaneous  events  not  listed  above  (i.e.,  which  could  include: 
auditory,  ocular,  metabolic,  hepatic,  central  nervous  system,  renal,  or  pulmonary  AEs) 
should be managed symptomatically if possible, if these are Grade <3 AEs.  For Grade 3 
AEs (clinically severe toxicities), chemotherapy should be held for a maximum of 2 weeks 
from  the  planned  date  of  re-infusion  until  toxicity  is  resolved  to  Grade  2  or  less,  then 
treatment  re-instituted  at  a  lower  dose,  if  medically  appropriate.    After  recovery  from 
toxicity Grade 3, a dose reduction of all drugs in subsequent cycles should be performed as 
follows:  oxaliplatin  to  65  mg/m2,  5-FU  bolus  to  300  mg/m2/day  and  5-FU  infusion  to 
500 mg/m2/day.    This  could  be  further  discussed  between  Investigator  and  Sponsor  if 
necessary.    In  case  of  no  resolution  to  Grade  2  or  less  (clinical  significant  AE)  after  a 
maximum  of  2  weeks  from  the  planned  date  of  re-infusion,  the  patient  should  be 
discontinued from treatment.  In case of clinically significant Grade 4 toxicity, the patient 
will  be  removed  from  treatment  and  followed  until  resolution  of  toxicity  according 
protocol and Investigator practice standards.

(Section  4.),  and  receipt  of  the  patient’s  informed  consent,  the  Investigator  will  call  a 
dedicated telephone number (Interactive Voice Randomization System (IVRS)  center) to 
receive  the  treatment  number  allocated  to  the  patient.  Patient  will  be  considered  as 
registered as soon as the allocation is given by the center. This treatment number will be 
maintained throughout the trial.  
The Operation  Manual provides details for this procedure. 

 

 

 
5.7 Packaging and labeling  

5.7.1 Xaliproden 

Xaliproden  and  matching  placebo  will  be  packaged  in  wallet  containing  18  capsules  (2-
week treatment). Each wallet will be labeled with the treatment number, the batch number 
and the expiry date. One-year treatment boxes containing 28 wallets will be supplied. 
The patient will be allocated one treatment number for the whole study.  
 
 
5.7.2  Oxaliplatin 

Information on expiration dates of oxaliplatin will be supplied on a lot-by-lot basis.  The 
Sponsor will notify the Investigator of any lots that are about to expire, and replacement 
supplies  will  be  shipped.    All  cancer  chemotherapeutic  agents  should  be  handled  with 
utmost care during preparation and administration.  To avoid any form of physical contact 
with the drug by the health care provider, gowns, gloves, and masks should be worn when 
appropriate.    As  a  parenteral  agent,  oxaliplatin  should  be  prepared  in  a  vertical-flow 
biologic  safety  cabinet.    Refer  to  hospital  guidelines  for  any  additional  precautions  that 
may apply.

of study drug will be returned to the investigator’s at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. 
Any unused capsules will be retrieved, their number related and the corresponding period 
documented on the CRF. 
 

6.  ASSESSMENT OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 

6.1 Efficacy 

6.1.1 Neuroprotection 

The  incidence  of  the  cumulative  peripheral  neurotoxicity  will  be  assessed  using  2 
parameters:  the  severity  grading  of  the  neurotoxicity  using  the  specific  oxaliplatin  scale 
((Table (5.4.2.3) 1)– section 5.4.2.3) and a neuro questionnaire (Modified Norris scale, see 
Appendix 4) (4). 
 

 

36/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

At  baseline  and  at  the  beginning  of  each  cycle  prior  to  treatment  a  neurological 
examination (see Appendix 3) will be performed by a neurologist (baseline) or the treating 
oncologist (each cycle) to determine the neurotoxicity severity grade.  At 12 cycles (or 6 
months on-study at least) or at the end of the treatment (+ 30 days following the last study-
chemotherapy  drug)  if  the  patient  withdraws  before  6  months,  the  neurological 
examination will be performed by the neurologist. The physician together with the patient 
will fill in the modified Norris Scale every 4 cycles. 
If  neurotoxicity  persists  at  study  withdrawal,  neurological  symptoms  will  be  followed 
every month for at least 2 months to document the time to recovery. 
 
Evaluation of motor and sensory conduction velocities will be performed at baseline and at 
12 cycles of treatment (or end of treatment  < 12 cycles) :  
Motor  conduction  velocity  :  peroneal  nerve  on  both  sides  and  compound  muscle  action 
potential (CMAP) and distal latency will be measured by standard methods. 
Sural  nerve  conduction  velocity  and  sensory  action  potential  (SAP)  will  be  recorded 
antidromically  by  surface  electrodes  on  both  sides.  When  SAPs  were  not  detectable  by 
surface electrodes, the near-nerve needle method will be used. For each patient, the sum of 
the  amplitudes  of  the  CMAPs  and  those  of  SAPs  of  both  sides  at  inclusion,  will  be 
compared with those at 12 cycles (or at end of treatment). 
The same Technique must be used by the same investigator at inclusion and at the end of 
study. EMG records should be carefully kept at study site.

6.1.2 Antitumoral efficacy 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

At all time points tumor evaluations must consist of a CT or MRI scan. At baseline, CT or 
MRI scan(s) should have been performed within 28 days of the 1st planned treatment. 
 
For patients with target lesions located in the liver, a CT or MRI scan of the abdomen is 
required.    A  chest  X-ray  is  also  required  at  each  tumor  evaluation  to  follow  non-target 
lesions or the appearance of new lesions in the lung. 
 
For patients with target lesions located in the lung, a CT or MRI of the chest is required. In 
order to follow non-target lesions or the appearance of new lesions in the liver, the CT or 
MRI images must also include the liver. 
 
For patients with target lesions located in the colon or rectum, a CT or MRI of the pelvis is 
required.    In  order  to  follow  non-target  lesions  or  the  appearance  of  new  lesions  in  the 
liver or lung, a CT or MRI of the abdomen and a chest X-ray is required. Chest X-ray at 
baseline should have been performed within 21 days of the 1st planned treatment. 
 
A tumor evaluation will be performed by a CT or MRI scan every 4 cycles, i.e. every 
8 weeks (2 months). A chest X-ray will also be performed if a chest CT is not performed.  
The  same  measuring  instrument  should  be  used  throughout  treatment  to  maintain 
consistency.  After a tumor evaluation is performed which demonstrates a tumor response, 
confirmation  of  the  response  will  be  obtained  by  a  second  examination  to  be 
performed not less than 4 weeks but not more than 6 weeks later. If a cycle is delayed, 
confirmation of the response will be performed no more than 6 weeks after the previous 
examination. 
Up  to  10  target  lesions  identified  at  baseline  will  be  followed throughout  the study.    At 
least  1  lesion  must  be  unidimensionally measurable  with  a diameter  of  at  least ≥20  mm 
using conventional CT or MRI or ≥10 mm using spiral CT. 
 
At the end of the study, the best overall response achieved by each patient during the study 
will be scored.  The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease 
the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the patient’s 
best response assignment will depend on the achievement of response by the RECIST (3) 
criteria  :  a  copy  of  the  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  Quick 
Reference is presented in Appendix 6. 
 
To be scored as a Complete Response (CR)  or Partial Response (PR) , the response must 
be confirmed by a repeat CT or MRI scan performed within 4-6 weeks. Disease response 
will be determined by either a CR defined as the disappearance of all target lesions or a PR 
defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter. 

 

38/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

Disease  progression  will  be  determined  by  at  least  a  20%  increase  in  the  sum  of  the 
longest  diameter  of  target  lesions,  taking  as  reference  the  smallest  sum  of  the  longest 
diameter  since  the  treatment  started  or  the  appearance  of  one  or  more  new  lesions.  The 
date  of  progression  is  defined  as  the  date  of  first  evidence  of  disease  progression 
documented  by  an  imaging  study,  not  the  confirmation  of  this  evaluation  obtained 
subsequently.  Hepatomegaly alone is not sufficient to assess response or progression. 
 
In the presence of evidence suggestive of progression, such as rising CEA, increasing liver 
enzymes,  declining  performance  status,  weight  loss  or  increasing  pain,  every  reasonable 
effort  should  be  made  to  document  the  nature  of  progressive  disease  by  appropriate 
imaging studies.  Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify 
for  partial  response  nor  sufficient  increase  to  qualify  for  progressive  disease,  taking  as 
reference  the  smallest  sum  of  the  longest  diameter  since  treatment  started.    The 
Investigator  may  remove  a  patient  from  the  study  either  for  progression  when  it  is  not 
possible to obtain an imaging study or for any other reason if it is determined that it is in 
the  best  interest  of  the  patient  to  do so; however, the rationale for this decision must be 
recorded in the patient’s medical chart. 
 
Tumor  evaluation  criteria  by  which  the  Investigator  will  judge  disease  response  or 
progression is summarized in (Table (6.1.2) 1). Clear evidence of response must be present 
in the patient’s medical record and this data will be recorded on the patient's Case Report 
Form (CRF).   
 
The  investigational  staff  at  each  site  must  retain  copies  of  images  to  document  tumor 
response status for all patients (i.e., all patients judged to have CR, PR, SD , or PD). 
 
For  each  individual  patient,  the  same  method  of  measurement  must  be  used  for  tumor 
evaluation throughout the study: chest X-ray, CT scan, or MRI scan.  If contrast agent is 
used at baseline, it must be used for all subsequent scans.  Ultrasound is not permitted for 
evaluation of tumor response.

of target lesions compared to the smallest diameter recorded 
during treatment.   

In addition, the appearance of any new lesions is considered PD. 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor

6.2 Safety 

All  patients  will  be  followed  for  safety  at  each  visit  during  treatment  and  follow  up 
((Section 9.1) (Table (9.1.1) 1 ). The severity of adverse event is determined using the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria version 2. (Appendix 5) 
 

7.  PATIENT SAFETY 

7.1 Adverse Events monitoring 

Definitions: 
 
An  Adverse  Event  is  any  untoward  medical  occurrence  in  a  patient  or  clinical 
investigation  patient  administered  a  pharmaceutical  product  and  which  does  not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
 

 

41/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•  Results in death or 
•  Is life-threatening or 

Note: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe. 

•  Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or  
•  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or 
•  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
•  Is a medically important event 
 
Medical  and  scientific  judgment  should  be  exercised  in  deciding  whether  expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient  or  may  require  intervention  to  prevent  one  of  the  other  outcomes  listed  in  the 
definition above. 
These should also usually be considered serious. 
 

Note: Examples  of  such  events  are  intensive  treatment  in  an  emergency  room  or  at  home  for  allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions orasymptomatic ALT increase > 10 ULN that do not 
result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 

 
All  death  occurring  while  the  patient  is  on  study  including  deaths  due  to  progressive 
disease  and  deaths  within  30  days  after  last administration  of  study  treatment  should be 
notified as SAE. 
 
Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment, including 
those occurring during the wash-out period (where applicable), are to be recorded on the 
corresponding page(s) included in the Case Report Form.  Whenever possible, symptoms 
should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis.  The Investigator should specify the 
date  of  onset,  maximal  intensity,  action  taken  with  respect  to  study  drug,  corrective 
therapy given, outcome and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility 
that the Adverse Event was caused by the study treatment. 
 
Serious Adverse Events 
In the case of a Serious Adverse Event the Investigator must immediately: 
•  SEND  (within  1 working  day,  preferably  by  fax) the  signed  and  dated  corresponding 
page(s) in the Case Report Form to the representative of the Monitoring Team whose 
name and address and fax number appear on the protocol ; 

•  ATTACH the photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these 
examinations  were  performed.    For  laboratory  results,  include  the  laboratory  normal 
ranges. 

 

42/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

For  blinded  studies,  the  code  must  be  broken  only  in  exceptional  circumstances  when 
knowledge of the study medication is essential for treating the patient. 
 
 
Follow-up 
 
•  The  Investigator  should  take  all  appropriate  measures  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the 
patients,  notably  he  should  follow  up  the  outcome  of  any  Adverse  Events  (clinical 
signs, laboratory values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or until consolidation 
of the patient conditions. 

•  In the case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient must be followed up until clinical 
recovery  is  complete  and  laboratory  results  have  returned  to  normal,  or  until 
progression has been stabilized.  This may imply that follow-up will continue after the 
patient  has  left  the  study  and  that  additional  investigations  may  be  requested  by  the 
Monitoring Team. 

•  In case of any Serious Adverse Event brought to the attention of the Investigator at any 
time after cessation of study medication and considered by him/her caused by the study 
treatment with a reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the Monitoring Team. 

 
7.2 Safety instructions specific to the study 

Adverse  events  will  be  recorded  for  all  patients  (including  those  withdrawing  from  the 
study treatment because of toxicity), 30 days following the last dose of oxaliplatin (Day 30 
post  chemotherapy  visit),  considering  Xaliproden  had  been  discontinued  within  this 
period.  Adverse  events  related  to  study  treatments  that  are observed, either during study 
treatment,  or  within  one  month  after  the  30th  day  following  the  last  dose  of  oxaliplatin 
(see  section  9.1.6),  will  be  followed  until  resolution  or  stabilization.  Neurological 
toxicities, present at withdrawal (Day 30 post chemotherapy visit) will be followed each 
month for at least two months after the Day 30 post chemotherapy visit.  
Adverse events possibly related to the study treatments, that occur within one month after 
the Day 30 post chemotherapy visit, will be recorded in the follow-up part of CRF (Follow 
up at one and two months).   
 
After the 30 days following the last dose of oxaliplatin, SAE will be notified to sponsor 
until the initiation of another anti-tumoral regimen (e.g second line chemotherapy). 
 
7.3 Laboratory tests monitoring 

Laboratories  and  clinical  tests  will  be  performed  throughout  the  study  as  specified  in 
(Section  9.1).  A  central  laboratory  will  not  be  used  for  this  study  and  laboratory 
evaluations will be performed by local laboratories.

8.  HANDLING OF STUDY TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION 

8.1 List of withdrawal criteria 

Patients  will  be  withdrawn  from  the  study  treatment  for  the  following  medical  and/or 
administrative reason :  
-  Completion of treatment (as described in Section 3.4). 
-  Disease progression (or death due to progressive disease) : the date and evidence for 

disease progression will be documented in the medical record; 

-  Adverse event, treatment-limiting toxicity, inter-current medical problem, 
-  Voluntary withdrawal, investigator’s decision. 
 
Post-treatment  follow-up  will  continue,  as  described  in  (Section  9.1.6).  When  a  patient 
withdraws from the study, the reason and date of withdrawal will be recorded on the CRF.  
An attempt to obtain all end-of-study evaluations is expected.  All data collected for the 
study must be recorded on CRFs and provided to the Sponsor. 
 
 
8.2 Reasons for withdrawal 

The  patients  may  withdraw  from  the  study  if  they  decide  to  do  so,  at  any  time  and 
irrespective of reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. 
 
8.3 Withdrawal follow-up procedure 

For  patients  considered  lost  of  follow-up,  the  CRF  must  be  filled  in  up  to  the  last  visit 
performed.  The  Investigator  should  make  every  effort  to  re-contact  and  to  identify  the 
reason why the patient failed to attend the visit and to determine his/her health status. 
 
8.4 Consequence 

Patients  who  have  been  withdrawn  from  the  study  cannot  be  re-included  in  the  study.  
Their inclusion and treatment number must not be re-used.  
 

9.  STUDY PROCEDURES 

9.1 Visit schedule 

The  assessments  and  measurements  to  be  conducted  during  the  screening  period  and

9.1.1 Baseline 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

An  interview  will  take  place  involving  the  patient  and  the  Investigator  to  determine 
whether or not the patient is eligible to enter the study. It is possible to make use of the 
assessments already performed as a routine procedure within 28 days before registration. If 
it  is  determined  that  the  patient  is  a  candidate  for  the  study,  the  patient  (or  his  or  her 
legally authorized representative) and the Investigator will sign the informed consent form. 
The  informed  consent  has  to  be  obtained  before  any  further  assessment  in  order  to 
complete the whole clinical study baseline assessments as required per protocol. 
 
If  female,  the  patient  must  not  be  pregnant  or  lactating.    Documentation  of  a  negative 
serum  HCG  pregnancy  test  for  women  of  childbearing  potential  is  required  prior  to 
randomization.    Men  and  women  who  are  fertile  must  use  a  medically  acceptable 
contraceptive  throughout  the  treatment  period  and  for  6  months  following  cessation  of 
treatment with oxaliplatin.  Patients must be made aware, before entering this trial, of the 
risk in becoming pregnant or in fathering children. 
 
•  Neurologist baseline visit 
 
Electromyography  test  has  to  be  performed  at  least  28  days  before  the  first  treatment 
administration. 
Motor  conduction  velocity  :  peroneal  nerve  on  both  sides  and  compound  muscle  action 
potential (CMAP) and distal latency will be measured by standards methods. 
Sural  nerve  conduction  velocity  and  sensory  action  potential  (SAP)  will  be  recorded 
antidromically  by  surface  electrodes  on  both  sides.  When  SAPs  were  not  detectable  by 
surface electrodes, the near-nerve needle method will be used. The skin temperature must 
be controlled. 
 
Neurologist will also complete the neuro-questionnaire (modified Norris Scale (4) together 
with the patient and performed a complete neuro-sensory assessment (see Appendix 3). 
 
•  The Investigator will then evaluate the results of the clinical and laboratory assessments 

as shown in Table (9.1.1) 1.

9.2 Definition of source data 

Source  Data :  All  information  of  clinical  findings,  observations,  or  other  activities  in  a 
clinical  trial  necessary  for  the  reconstruction  of  data  sources  and  evaluation  of  the  trial. 
Source  data  are  contained  in  source  documents  (original  records  or  certified  copies). 
Parameters  which  are  specifically  collected  for  the  study  in  the  CRF  (patient’s  diary, 
questionnaire ...) and which are not part of the patient’s medical file will be considered as 
source data. 
 
Source Documents : Original documents, data, and records (e.g. hospital records, clinical 
and  office  charts,  laboratory  notes,  memoranda,  records,  recorded  data  from  automated 
instruments,  copies  or  transcriptions  certified  after  verification  as  being  accurate  copies, 
microfiches,  photographic  negatives,  microfilm  or  magnetic  media,  x-rays,  subject  files, 
and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico-technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial).  

 

51/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

 
The patient must have consented to allow their medical records to be viewed by sponsor-
authorized  personnel  and  by  local  and  possibly  foreign  regulatory  authorities.  This 
information is included in the informed consent. Any effort should be done to keep in the 
hospital  records  the  radiographic  images  and  the  EMG  records  performed  during  the 
study. 
 
9.3 Access to the randomization code during the study 
•  In  case  of  a  Serious  Adverse  Event,  the  code  must  be  broken  only  in  exceptional 
circumstances  when  knowledge  of  the  study  medication  is  essential  for  treating  the 
patient.    If  possible  a  contact  should  be  initiated  with  the  Monitoring  Team  before 
breaking the code. 

•  The  IVRS  center  should  be  called  if  decoding  is  necessary,  only  if  this  fails,  sealed 
decoding envelopes supplied with the study treatment (or tear off labels) can be opened. 
They are kept in a safe place on site throughout the trial. The sponsor will retrieve them 
(opened or sealed) on completion of the clinical trial. 

 

10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

10.1 Statistical and analytical plans 

The section 10 contains a general description of the statistical design and of the analyses 
that will be performed to compare arm A and arm B on the 2 primary efficacy endpoints : 
oxaliplatin-induced  cumulative  neurotoxicity  and  response  rate.  Methods  are  also 
described for the analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints and safety. 
 
The methods presented in this section will be updated and validated during the course of 
the  study.  The  final  version  of  the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP  )  will  be  issued  before 
code breaking. 
 
 
10.2 Determination of sample size 

The 2 primary variables are: incidence of grade 3-4 neurotoxicity and response rate (RR). 
 
A 2-step design (using the O'Brien and Fleming (5) approach) is proposed with a formal 
interim analysis of RR. In addition, the possibility to stop prematurely the trial in case of 
inefficacy or safety issues is made possible by the use of an external IDMC.

  are  treated  and  evaluable  for  antitumoral  response.  A  formal  RR  analysis  and 
comparison  between  the  two  treatment arms  will  be  performed.  The  SAP  will  detail  the 
different possible results of the RR comparison. During this meeting a review of the safety 
profile including the neurotoxicity incidence in each treatment arm (observed incidence by 
patient  and  estimation  with  the  survival  life  table  approach),  will  be  presented  and 
discussed. The censoring and the hazard rates of the neurotoxicity events will be checked 
and  compared  to  the  protocol  assumptions.  In  case  of  large  deviations,  the  IDMC  may 
propose  any  recommendation  thought  to be  appropriate, including revisiting the sample 
size (6). 
 
For both parameters, the sample size will be adjusted according to the method described 
 
by Cui, Hung and Wang (6).

10.4.1 Disposition of patients 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

The  numbers  of  patients  randomized,  treated,  ITT,  Per  Protocol  will  be  summarized  by 
treatment arm.  Reasons for stopping treatment will be also described (See definitions of 
these populations in Section 10.5.1). 
 
10.4.2 Protocol deviations 

Protocol deviations will be listed and classified into minor/major deviations during a blind 
review before the randomization code is broken. 
Major protocol deviations, i.e. deviations leading to exclusion of patients or visits from the 
PP analysis, include, but are not limited to,  

•  Violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria (to be defined more precisely in the SAP). 
•  Receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimens not specified in the protocol. 
•  Failure  to  administer  the  randomized  treatment,  i.e.  xaliproden/placebo,  (such  as 

wrong regimen or no drug) 

•  Failure to follow dose modification procedure in the protocol. 
•  Receipt of concomitant anti-cancer treatment prohibited by the protocol. 
•  Missing data in key efficacy, especially tumoral evaluation, or safety parameters. 

 
 
10.5 Data analysis considerations 

10.5.1 Dataset analyzed 

All randomized patients will be included in the intent-to-treat  (ITT) population.  
 
All  patients  receiving  both  oxaliplatin  and  the  study  drug  (xaliproden/placebo)  will  be 
considered  as  treated  and  included  in  the  safety  analysis.  The  safety  of  non-treated 
patients will be listed separately.  
 
All patients who meet the main inclusion criteria (eligible), without major deviations on 
treatment  and  who  are  evaluable  for  response  (at  least  one  tumoral  evaluation  i.e.  4 
treatment cycles except for early progressors) will be included in the Per Protocol  (PP) 
population. 
 
A  subset  of  safety  population  for  neurotoxicity  analysis  will  be  defined:  patients 
exposed  to  the  chemotherapy  and  the  study  drug  (xaliproden/placebo)  for  at  least  6 
months.

mean, standard deviation, median and range. 
 
All  statistical  tests  will  be  performed  using  a  type  I  error  rate  of  0.05,  except  for  final 
analysis of RR (alpha-spending due to interim analysis, see description of RR analysis in 
Section 10.8.1.2 ).  
 
Details of statistical methods related to efficacy or safety can be found in efficacy or safety 
appropriate sections. 
 
10.5.3 General convention

•  Response Rate  
 
The  RR  is  defined  as  the  number  of  confirmed  responders  (CR  and  PR)  divided  by  the 
number  of  patients  considered  in  the  analysis  population  (ITT  or  Per  Protocol).  No 
independent external radiological review of radiological response will be performed. Only 
radiological  response  assessed  by  investigators  every  4  cycles  will  be  analyzed (see 
Section 6.1.2 for details on tumor evaluations based on the RECIST criteria).   
 
After a tumor evaluation is performed which demonstrates a tumor response (CR or PR), 
confirmation  of  the  response  will be  obtained  by  a  second  examination  to be  performed 
not less than 4 weeks but not more than 6 weeks later. If a cycle is delayed, confirmation 
of the response will be performed no more than 6 weeks after the previous examination. 
 
Confirmed response (CR or PR) are defined using the rules defined in the following table :

10.8.1.2 Primary analysis 

a)  Incidence of severe oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity 
 
The  incidence  of  Grade  3-4  neurotoxicity  will  be  studied  according  to  the  oxaliplatin 
cumulative dose at neurotoxicity onset using the life table method. Oxaliplatin cumulative 
dose to onset is defined as the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin (mg/m2) administered prior 
to and including the cycle at which neurotoxicity was first recorded. 
 
If  no  grade  3-4  neurotoxicity  for  a  particular  patient  occurs  before  the  patient  is  lost  to 
follow-up  or  before  the  end  of  trial  or  before  death,  this  patient  will  be  considered 
censored for this variable at D30 (30 days after the last oxaliplatin administration).  
 
At each level of cumulative dose, the number of patients at risk, the number of censored 
patients, the number of events, the probability to experiment neurosensory toxicity and the 
cumulative probability will be given.

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

 
The  incidence  of  Grade  3-4  neurotoxicity  will  be  compared  between  the  two  treatments 
arms by a 2-sided logrank test. 
 
b)  Response Rate 
 
The  analysis  of  the  RR  will  be  performed  using  a  2-step  design.  In  order  to  ensure  an 
overall  type  I  error  of  0.05, the following method will be performed (using the O'Brien,  
Fleming and Harrington (7) approach) : 
 
•  Interim analysis of the RR on the 100 first patients of each arm : formal comparison of 
RR  between  the  2  arms  using  a  one-sided  chi-square  test with a type I error equal to 
0.005 

•  Final  analysis  :  Non-inferiority  will  be  demonstrated  if  the  lower  bound  of  the  95 % 
confidence interval of the ratio of the response rates is at least 0.80 (8). This test will be 
performed  using  a  type  I  error  equal  to  0.048  (after  taking  in  account  the  alpha-
spending of the interim analysis).  

 
 
10.8.1.2.1 Data transformation before analysis, if any 

Any data transformation before analysis, if any, will be detailed in the final version of the 
SAP. 
 
 
10.8.1.3 Other analyses for primary variable(s) 

The  incidence  of  severe  oxaliplatin-induced  neurotoxicity  will  be  also  analyzed  on  the 
subset of patients evaluable for neurotoxicity, using the study treatment actually received 
(xaliproden or placebo).  
 
Additional  exploratory  analyses  may  be  considered.  For  example,  competitive  risks 
methods may be used to analyze the incidence of severe oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity.  
These additional analyses will be detailed in the final version of the SAP. 
 
 
10.8.2 Secondary / other efficacy variables 
•  Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response achieved by each patient during the study will be scored.   
It will be summarized by treatment group using counts and percents. 
 
•  Time-related parameters : PFS and OS 
 

 

59/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

OS  is  calculated  as  the  number  of  months  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  death 
(whatever the cause). 
PFS  is  calculated  as  the  number  of  months  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  disease 
progression/recurrence or death (whatever the cause). 
 
They will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with 95% Confidence Interval of 
the median survival.  
 
Censoring for OS and PFS will be handled similarly, according to the considered event: 
disease progression or death for PFS, death for OS. 
 
The censor mechanism for PFS is presented below : 
 
In the event that death or disease progression for a particular patient occurs after the end of 
trial  date,  the  PFS  for  that  patient  will  be  the  number  of  months  from  the  date  of 
randomization  to  the  end  of  trial  date.    In  the  analysis  the  patient  will  be  considered 
censored (without disease progression or death).  
 
If  a  patient  is  lost  to  follow-up  prior  to  the  end  of  trial  date  and  prior  to  experiencing 
disease progression or death, the PFS for that patient will be the number of months from 
the  date  of  randomization  to  the  latest  date  for  which  it  was  known  that  progression  or 
death  had  not  occurred.  In  the  analysis  this  patient  will  be  censored  (without  disease 
progression or death).  
 
In the PP analysis of time-related parameters, patients who receive additional anti-cancer 
therapy prior to documented disease recurrence will be considered censored on the date of 
anti-cancer therapy. 
 
 
•  Secondary parameters of neurotoxicity assessed by the oxaliplatin specific scale : 

 
o  Overall  incidence  per  patient  of  peripheral  neurotoxicity  during  treatment 

(grade 1, 2, 3-4) 

o  Time and dose to onset of peripheral neurotoxicity.  
o  Incidence of dose-reduction and dose-delay due to peripheral neurotoxicity: 
counts  and percents  of patients/cycles with dose-reduction and dose-delay 
due to peripheral neurotoxicity 

o  Incidence  of  oxaliplatin  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  peripheral 

neurotoxicity 

o  Time  to  recovery  (partial,  complete)  :  time  from  grade  3-4  neurotoxicity 
onset until partial or complete resolution. Partial resolution is a reduction in 
severity of at least one grade still > 0 (i.e. grade 3 to grade 2 or 1, or grade 2 
to grade 1).  Complete resolution is a reduction in severity to grade 0.  

 
Binary parameters will be summarized using counts and percents. 

 

60/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 
 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

 
Time/dose  to  onset  of  peripheral  neurotoxicity  and  time  to  recovery  (partial,  complete) 
will  be  estimated  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method,  with  95%  Confidence  Interval  of  the 
median survival. For time/dose to onset of neurotoxicity, censor mechanism of time/dose 
is presented in (Section 10.8.1.2). 
For time to recovery, in case the neurosensory toxicity is not resolved at the latest follow-
up, the resolution date will be the date of the follow-up, and duration will be considered 
right censored. 

 
 

•  The modified Norris scale is assessed by the treating oncologist every 4 cycles, and by 
the  neurologist  at  baseline  and  after  12  cycles  (or  end  of  treatment).  It  includes  27 
items graded 0 to 3 (0 = unable to perform a task, 3 = normal). The following Norris 
total score classes will be used (9):  

o  0 – 50 : severe disability (patient bedridden or chairbound) 
o  51 – 60 : moderate disability (patient needs assistance for most activities) 
o  61 – 70 : mild disability (patient needs assistance only on occasion) 
o  71 – 81  : normal 

 
The  Norris  classes  at  4-cycle  intervals  and  the  worst  Norris  class  by  patient  will  be 
summarized by treatment groups using counts and percents. 
 
A shift table showing the Norris class at 12 cycles (or end of treatment) vs. baseline will 
be also provided. 
 
The  consistency  of  the  evaluation  of  severe  neurotoxicity  using  the  2  scales  (modified 
Norris scale and oxaliplatin specific scale) should be described. 
 
•  EMG : CMAPs  and SAPs evaluations will be performed at baseline and after 12 cycles 
(or end of treatment). The evolution versus baseline will be summarized by treatment 
arm using absolute change and relative change.

# Posology and method of administration 
 

Pharmaceutical form 

Clinical particulars 

Posology 
 
FOR ADULTS ONLY 
 
Oxaliplatin has been administrated according to various dosages and schedules during its 
clinical  development.  The  two  most  common  regimens  were  85  mg/m²  intravenously 
repeated  every  2  weeks  and  130  mg/m²  intravenously  repeated  every  3  weeks.  These 
regimens correspond to the same dose intensity. 
 
Dosage  given  should  be  adjusted  according  to  tolerability  (see  7.4.3  "Special  warnings 
and precautions for use"). 
 
Oxaliplatin should always be administered before fluoropyrimidines. 
 
Oxaliplatin is administered as a 2- to 6-hour intravenous infusion in 250 to 500 mL of 5% 
dextrose solution. 
 
Oxaliplatin  was  mainly  used  in  combination  with  continuous  infusion  5-fluorouracil 
based regimens. For the bi-weekly treatment schedule 5-fluorouracil regimens combining 
bolus and continuous infusion were used.

Special populations 

 
• 

 
• 

 
• 

 Renal impairment:   

Oxaliplatin  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (See  7.4.2 
“Contra-indications”).  In patients with moderate renal impairment, treatment may be 
initiated  at  the  normally  recommended  dose  (see  7.4.3  “Special  warnings  and 
precautions for use”). There is no need for dose adjustment in patients with mild renal 
dysfunction. 

 Hepatic insufficiency: 

Oxaliplatin  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.  No 
increase  in  oxaliplatin  acute  toxicities  was  observed  in  the  subset  of  patients  with 
abnormal liver function tests at baseline. No specific dose adjustment for patients with 
abnormal liver function tests was performed during clinical development. 

 Elderly patients : 

No  increase  in  severe  toxicities  was  observed  when  oxaliplatin  was  used as  a  single 
agent  or  in  combination  with  5-fluorouracil  in  patients  over  the  age  of  65.  In 
consequence no specific dose adaptation is required for elderly patients. 

 
Method of administration 
 
Oxaliplatin is administered by intravenous infusion. 
 
The  administration  of  oxaliplatin  does  not  require  hyperhydration.  Oxaliplatin  is  to  be 
diluted in 250 to 500 mL of 5% dextrose solution to give a final oxaliplatin concentration 
of  not  less  than  0.2  mg/mL.  Oxaliplatin  must  be  infused  either  via  a  peripheral  vein  or 
central venous line over 2 to 6 hours. Oxaliplatin infusion should always precede that of 
5-fluorouracil.  When oxaliplatin is administered with folinic acid, separate infusion bags 
and lines must be used, with Y-tubing to connect the two lines before the single injection 
site. 
 
In the event of extravasation, administration must be discontinued immediately. 
 
Instructions for use 
 
Oxaliplatin  must  be  reconstituted  and  further  diluted before use. Only the recommended 
diluents  should  be  used  to  reconstitute  and  then  dilute  the  freeze-dried  product.  (See 
Section 7.6.6   “Instructions for use / handling and disposal”). 
 
# Contra-indications 
 
Oxaliplatin is contra-indicated in patients who 
•  have a known history of hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin. 
•  are breast feeding. 

72/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

 

•  have  myelosuppression  prior  to  starting  first  course,  as  defined  in  the  inclusion  / 

exclusion criteria of the study protocol. 

•  have a peripheral sensitive neuropathy with functional impairment prior to first course. 
•  have a severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). 
 
# Special warnings and precautions for use 

Oxaliplatin should only be used in specialized departments of oncology and should be 
administered under the supervision of an experienced oncologist. 

 
Oxaliplatin  did  not  demonstrate  nephrotoxicity.  However,  due  to  limited  information  on 
safety in patients with moderately impaired renal function, administration should only be 
considered after suitable appraisal of the benefit/risk for the patient.  In this situation, renal 
function should be closely monitored and dose adjusted according to toxicity. 
 
Patients with a history of allergic reaction to platinum compounds should be monitored for 
allergic  symptoms.  In  case  of  an  anaphylactic-like  reaction  to  oxaliplatin,  the  infusion 
should  be  immediately  discontinued  and  appropriate  symptomatic  treatment  initiated. 
Oxaliplatin rechallenge is contra-indicated. 
 
Oxaliplatin has minimal to no vesicant potential. Local mild to moderate inflammation has 
been reported.  However, in case of oxaliplatin extravasation, the infusion must be stopped 
immediately and usual local symptomatic treatment initiated. 
 
Neurological  toxicity  of  oxaliplatin  should  be  carefully  monitored,  especially  if  co-
administered  with  other  medications  with  specific  neurological  toxicity.  A  neurological 
examination should be performed before each administration and periodically thereafter. 
 
For  patients  who  develop  acute  laryngopharyngeal  dysesthesia  (see  7.4.7  “Undesirable 
effects”),  during  or  within  the  hours  following  the  2-hour  infusion,  the  next  oxaliplatin 
infusion should be administered over 6 hours. 
 
If  neurological  symptoms  (paresthesia,  dysesthesia)  occur,  oxaliplatin  dosage  should  be  
adjusted  based  on  the  duration  and  severity  of  these  symptoms  following  the  specific 
recommendations which can be found in the “dose and schedule modification” section of 
the study protocol. 
 
Gastrointestinal  toxicity,  which  manifests  as  nausea and vomiting, warrants prophylactic 
and/or  therapeutic  antiemetic  therapy  (see  7.4.7  “Undesirable  effects”).  Dehydration, 
paralytic  ileus,  intestinal  obstruction,  hypokalemia,  metabolic  acidosis  and  renal 
impairment  may  be  caused  by  severe  diarrhea/emesis  particularly  when  combining 
oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil. 
 
If  hematological  toxicity  occurs  (neutrophils  or  platelets),  administration  of  the  next 
course  of  therapy  should  be  postponed  until  hematological  values  return  to  acceptable 

73/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

levels  as  defined  in  the  study  protocol.  A  full  blood  count  with  white  cell  differential 
should be performed prior to start of therapy and before each subsequent course.   
 
Patients must be adequately informed of the risk of diarrhea/emesis and neutropenia after 
oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil  administration  so  that  they  can  urgently  contact  their  treating 
physician for appropriate management. 
 
For oxaliplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil (with or without folinic acid), the usual dose 
adjustments  for  5-fluorouracil  associated  toxicities  should  apply.    If  WHO  grade  4 
diarrhea,  grade  3-4  neutropenia  (neutrophils  < 1.0x109/l),  grade  3-4  thrombocytopenia 
(platelets < 50x109/l) occur, the dose of oxaliplatin should be reduced by 25%, in addition 
to any 5-fluorouracil dose reductions required. 
 
In the case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnoea, 
crackles  or  radiological  pulmonary  infiltrates,  oxaliplatin  should  be  discontinued  until 
further  pulmonary  investigations  exclude  an  interstitial  lung  disease  (see  section  7.4.7 
“Undesirable effects”).  
 
# Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 
In  patients  who  have  received  a  single  dose  of  85 mg/m2  of  oxaliplatin,  immediately 
before  administration  of  5-fluorouracil,  no  change  in  the  level  of  exposure  to 
5-fluorouracil  has  been  observed.  In  vitro,  no  significant  displacement  of  oxaliplatin 
binding  to  plasma  proteins  has  been  observed  with  the  following  agents:  erythromycin, 
salicylates,  granisetron,  paclitaxel,  and  sodium  valproate.    In  addition,  no  significant 
pharmacokinetic interactions with CPT-11 have been reported. 
 
# Pregnancy and lactation 
 
To date there is no available information on safety of use in pregnant women. Based on 
preclinical findings, oxaliplatin is likely to be lethal and /or teratogenic to the human fetus 
at  the  recommended  therapeutic  dose,  and  is  consequently  not  recommended  during 
pregnancy and should only be considered after suitably appraising the patient of the risk to 
the fetus and with the patient’s consent. 
 
Excretion  in  breast  milk  has  not  been  studied.  Breast-feeding  is  contra-indicated  during 
oxaliplatin therapy.

Grade 1-2 elevation of liver enzymes is frequent during treatment with oxaliplatin. 
 
In randomised studies comparing the combination of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid with 
the combination of 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin, the incidence of grade 3-4 
elevation of liver enzymes was comparable in both groups. 
 
Nervous system: 
 
The dose limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin is neurological.  It involves a sensory peripheral 
neuropathy  characterized  by  dysesthesia  and/or  paresthesia  of  the  extremities  with  or 
without  cramps,  often  triggered  by  the  cold.  These  symptoms  occur  in  85%  to  95%  of 
patients treated. The duration of these symptoms, which usually regress between courses 
of treatment, increases with the number of treatment cycles.  
 
The onset of pain and/or a functional disorder are indications, depending on the duration 
of  the  symptoms,  for  dose  adjustment,  or  even  treatment  discontinuation  (see  7.4.3 
“Special warnings and precautions for use”).  This functional disorder includes difficulties 
in  executing  delicate  movements  and  is  a  possible  consequence  of  sensory  impairment. 
The risk of occurrence of a functional disorder for a cumulative dose of approximately 800 
mg/m2  (i.e.  10  cycles)  is  15%  or  less.    The  neurological  signs  and  symptoms  improve 
when treatment is discontinued in the majority of cases. 
 
Acute  neurosensory  manifestations  (see  7.5.3  “Preclinical  safety  data”)  have  been 
reported. They  start within  hours of administration and often occur on exposure to cold.  
They  may  present  as  transient  paresthesia,  dysesthesia  and  hypoesthesia  or  as  an  acute 
syndrome  of  pharyngolaryngeal  dysesthesia.    This acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal 
dysesthesia,  with  an  incidence  estimated  between  1%  and  2%,  is  characterized  by 
subjective  sensations  of  dysphagia  and  dyspnoea,  without  any  objective  evidence  of 

76/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

respiratory  distress  (no  cyanosis  or  hypoxia)  or  of  laryngospasm  or  bronchospasm  (no 
stridor  or  wheezing);  jaw  spasm,  abnormal  tongue  sensation,  dysarthria  and  a feeling  of 
chest pressure have also been observed. Although antihistamines and bronchodilators have 
been administered in such cases, the symptoms are rapidly reversible even in the absence 
of treatment. Prolongation of the infusion helps to reduce the incidence of this syndrome 
(see 7.4.3 “Special warnings and precautions for use”). 
 
Other  neurological  symptoms  such  as  dysarthria,  loss  of  deep  tendon  reflex  and 
Lhermittes’s sign were reported during treatment with oxaliplatin.  Isolated cases of optic 
neuritis have been reported. 
 
Patients  should  be  informed  about  the  potential  consequences  of  exposure  to  cold.  It  is 
recommended  that  patients  avoid drinking  cold  beverages and  eating  frozen foods while 
being treated with oxaliplatin. 
 
Allergic reactions: 
 
Infrequent  allergic  reactions,  ranging  from  skin  rash  to  anaphylactic  shock  have  been 
described  with  other  platinum  derivatives.  Anaphylactic  type  reactions  were  reported  in 
around  0.5%  of  patients  treated  with  oxaliplatin  during  clinical  trial  and  in  the  post-
marketing experience. 
 
Other effects: 
 
Clinical ototoxicity occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with oxaliplatin. Cases of 
deafness have been rarely reported. 
 
Disturbances  of  renal  function  have  been  reported  in  approximately  3%  of  all  patients 
treated, with less than 1% of patients experiencing grade 3-4 abnormalities. 
 
During  clinical  and  post-marketing  studies,  no  significant  ventricular  arrhythmias  were 
reported with oxaliplatin administration. 
 
In combination with 5-fluorouracil, fever of moderate severity has been reported in 36% of 
patients.   
 
Grade 1-2 infections have been reported in 23% of patients. 
 
Febrile neutropenia occurs in less than 2% of patients. 
 
Rare cases of immune hemolytic anemia have been reported. 
 
Rare cases of acute interstitial lung disease and of pulmonary fibrosis have been reported 
(see Section 7.4.3 “Special warnings and precautions for use”).

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

Moderate  alopecia  has  been  reported  in 2%  of  patients  treated  with  oxaliplatin  as single 
agent  therapy;  the  combination  of  oxaliplatin  and  5-fluorouracil  did  not  increase  the 
incidence of alopecia observed during treatment with 5-fluorouracil alone. 
 
Oxaliplatin has minimal to no vesicant potential. Local mild to moderate inflammation has 
been reported (see 7.4.3 “Special warnings and precautions for use”). 
 
A transient fall in visual acuity has been reported in less than 0.1% of patients following 
administration of oxaliplatin. 
 
Dysarthria have been reported rarely (see subsection: “Nervous system”). 
 
# Overdose 
 
There  is  no known antidote to oxaliplatin. In cases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse 
events  can  be  expected. Monitoring  of  hematological  parameters  should  be  initiated and 
symptomatic treatment given. 
 
 
# Pharmacological properties 
 
# Pharmacodynamic properties 
 
Oxaliplatin  is  an  antineoplastic  drug  belonging  to  a  new  class  of  platinum  based 
compounds  in  which  the  platinum  atom  is  complexed  with  1,2-diaminocyclohexane 
(«DACH» )  and an oxalate group.  Oxaliplatin is a single enantiomer, the Cis -[oxalato  
(trans-λ-1,2- DACH ) platinum]. 
 
Oxaliplatin  exhibits  a  wide  spectrum  of  both in  vitro  cytotoxicity  and  in  vivo  antitumor 
activity  in  a  variety  of  tumor  model  systems  including  human  colorectal  cancer  models. 
Oxaliplatin  also  demonstrates  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  activity  in  various  cisplatin  resistant 
models.  A  synergistic  cytotoxic  action  has  been  observed  in  combination  with 
5-fluorouracil both in vitro and in vivo.  Studies on the mechanism of action of oxaliplatin, 
although  not  completely  elucidated,  show  that  the  aqua-derivatives  resulting  from  the 
biotransformation  of  oxaliplatin,  interact  with  DNA  to  form  both  inter-  and  intra-strand 
crosslinks, resulting in the disruption of DNA synthesis leading to cytotoxic and antitumor 
effects.

At  the  end  of  a  2-hour  infusion,  15%  of  the  administered  platinum  is  present  in  the 
systemic  circulation,  the  remaining  85%  being  rapidly  distributed  into  tissues  or 
eliminated in the urine. Irreversible binding to red blood cells and plasma, results in half-
lives in these matrices that are close to the natural turnover of red blood cells and serum 
albumin. No accumulation was observed in plasma ultrafiltrate following 85 mg/m2 every 
two weeks or 130 mg/m2 every three weeks and steady state was attained by cycle one in 
this matrix.  Inter- and intra-subject variability is generally low. 
 
Biotransformation in vitro is considered to be the result of non-enzymatic degradation and 
there is no evidence of cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of the diaminocyclohexane 
(DACH) ring. Oxaliplatin undergoes extensive biotransformation in patients, and no intact 
drug was detectable in plasma ultrafiltrate at the end of a 2 h infusion. Several cytotoxic 
biotransformation  products  including  the  monochloro,  dichloro  and  diaquo  DACH 
platinum species have been identified in the systemic circulation together with a number 
of inactive conjugates at later time points.   
 
Platinum  is  predominantly  excreted  in  urine,  with  clearance  mainly  in  the  48  hours 
following administration.  By day 5, approximately 54% of the total dose was recovered in 
the urine and < 3% in the feces. 
 
A  significant  decrease  in  clearance  from  17.6  ±  2.18  l/h  to  9.95  ±  1.91  l/h  in  renal 
impairment  was  observed  together with a statistically significant decrease in distribution 
volume  from  330  ±  40.9  to  241  ±  36.1  l.  The  effect  of  severe  renal  impairment  on 
platinum clearance has not been evaluated.

# Preclinical safety data 
 
The  target  organs  identified  in  preclinical  species  (mice,  rats,  dogs,  and/or  monkeys)  in 
single and multiple dose studies included the bone marrow, the gastrointestinal system, the 
kidney, the testes, the nervous system, and the heart.  The target organ toxicities observed 
in  animals  are  consistent  with  those  produced  by  other  platinum  containing  drugs  and 
DNA-damaging,  cytotoxic  drugs  used  in  the  treatment  of  human  cancers  with  the 
exception of the effects produced on the heart.  Effects on the heart were observed only in 
the dog and included electrophysiological disturbances with lethal ventricular fibrillation.  
It is considered that cardiotoxicity is specific to the dog or that the dog is more sensitive 
not only because it was observed in the dog alone but also because doses similar to those 
producing  lethal  cardiotoxicity  in  dogs  (150  mg/m2)  were  well  tolerated  by  humans.  
Preclinical  studies  using  rat  sensory  neurons  suggest  that  the  acute  neurosensory 
symptoms  related  to  oxaliplatin  may  involve  an  interaction  with  voltage-gated  Na+ 
channels. 
 
Oxaliplatin  was  mutagenic  and  clastogenic  in  mammalian  test  systems  and  produced 
embryo-fetal  toxicity  in  rats.  Oxaliplatin  is  considered  a  probable  carcinogen,  although 
carcinogenic studies have not been conducted.

# Instructions for handling 
 
The  handling  of  this  cytotoxic  agent  by  nursing  or  medical  personnel  requires  every 
precaution to guarantee the protection of the handler and his surroundings. 
 
The preparation of injectable solutions of cytotoxic agents must be carried out by trained 
specialist  personnel  with  knowledge  of  the  medicines  used,  in  conditions  that  guarantee 
the protection of the environment and in particular the protection of the personnel handling 
the  medicines.  It  requires  a  preparation  area  reserved for  this purpose.  It  is  forbidden to 
smoke, eat or drink in this area. 
 
Personnel  must  be  provided  with  appropriate  handling  materials,  notably  long-sleeved 
gowns,  protection  masks,  caps,  protective  goggles,  sterile  single-use  gloves,  protective 
covers for the work area, containers and collection bags for waste. 
 
Excreta and vomit must be handled with care. 
 
Pregnant women must be warned to avoid handling cytotoxic agents. 
  
Any  broken  container  must  be  treated  with  the  same  precautions  and  considered  as 
contaminated  waste.  Contaminated  waste  should  be  incinerated  in  suitably  labeled  rigid 
containers. See section “Disposal”. 
 
If  oxaliplatin  concentrate,  reconstituted  solution  or  infusion  solution,  should  come  into 
contact with skin, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. 
 
If  oxaliplatin  concentrate,  reconstituted  solution  or  infusion  solution,  should  come  into 
contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. 
 
 
# Special precautions for administration 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 

DO NOT use injection material containing aluminium. 
DO NOT administer undiluted. 
DO NOT reconstitute or dilute for infusion with saline solution. 
DO  NOT  mix  with  any  other  medication  in  the  same  infusion  bag  or  administer 
simultaneously by the same infusion line (in particular 5-fluorouracil, basic solutions, 
trometamol  and  folinic  acid  products  containing  trometamol  as  an  excipient). 
Oxaliplatin  can  be  co-administered  with  folinic  acid  infusion  using  a  Y-line  placed 
immediately before the site of injection. The drugs should not be combined in the same 
infusion bag. Folinic acid must be diluted using isotonic infusion solutions such as 5% 
glucose  solution  but  NOT  sodium  chloride  solutions  or  alkaline  solutions.    Flush  the 
line after oxaliplatin administration. 

• 

USE ONLY the recommended solvents (see below). 

82/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

• 

Any reconstituted solution that shows evidence of precipitation should not be used 
and should be destroyed with due regard to legal requirements for disposal of hazardous 
waste (see below). 

 
# Reconstitution of the solution 
 
• 

Water  for  injections  or  5%  dextrose  solution  should  be  used  to  reconstitute  the 

solution. 

For  a  vial  of  50  mg:  add  10  mL  of  solvent  to  obtain  a  concentration  of  5  mg 

oxaliplatin/mL. 

For  a  vial  of  100  mg:  add  20  mL  of  solvent  to  obtain  a  concentration  of  5  mg 

• 

• 

oxaliplatin/mL. 

 
From a microbiological and chemical point of view, the reconstituted solution should be 
diluted immediately with 5% dextrose solution. 
 
Inspect visually prior to use. Only clear solutions without particles should be used. 
 
The medicinal product is for single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded.  
 
# Dilution before infusion 
 
Withdraw  the  required  amount  of  reconstituted  solution  from  the  vial(s)  and  then  dilute 
with 250 to 500 ml of a 5% glucose solution to give an oxaliplatin concentration not less 
than 0.2 mg/ml. 
 
Administered by IV infusion. 
 
Chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C 
(36°F to 46°F).  
 
From  a  microbiological  point  of  view,  this  infusion  preparation  should  be  used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are 
the responsibility of the user and should normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 
8°C unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.   
 
Inspect visually prior to use. Only clear solutions without particles should be used. 
 
The medicinal product is for single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. 
 
NEVER use sodium chloride solution for either reconstitution or dilution. 
 
Infusion 
 
The administration of oxaliplatin does not require prehydration. 

83/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

 
Oxaliplatin diluted in 250 to 500 mL of a 5% dextrose solution to give a concentration not 
less than 0.2 mg/ml must be infused either by peripheral vein or central venous line over 2 
to 6 hours. When oxaliplatin is administered with 5-fluorouracil, the oxaliplatin infusion 
should precede that of 5-fluorouracil. 
 
Disposal 
 
Remnants  of  the  medicinal  product  as  well  as  all  materials  that  have  been  used  for 
reconstitution,  for  dilution  and  administration  must  be  destroyed  according  to  hospital 
standard procedures applicable to cytotoxic agents with due regard to current laws related 
to the disposal of hazardous waste.

Appendix 6: NEW GUIDELINES TO EVALUATE THE RESPONSE TO 

TREATMENT IN SOLID TUMORS 

 
 

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Quick Reference: 

 
Eligibility 
 
•  Only  patients  with  measurable  disease  at  baseline  should  be  included  in  protocols 

where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint.  

 

-  Measurable  disease  -  the  presence  of  at  least  one  measurable  lesion.  If  the 
measurable  disease  is  restricted  to  a  solitary  lesion,  its  neoplastic  nature  should  be 
confirmed by cytology/histology.  

-  Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
with longest diameter  ≥20 mm using conventional techniques or ≥10 mm with spiral 
CT scan. 

-  Nonmeasurable  lesions  -  all  other  lesions,  including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter 
<20  mm  with  conventional  techniques  or  <10  mm  with  spiral  CT  scan),  i.e.,  bone 
lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural/pericardial  effusion,  inflammatory 
breast  disease,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonis,  cystic  lesions,  and  also  abdominal 
masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques; and. 

   

•  All  measurements  should  be  taken  and  recorded  in  metric  notation,  using  a  ruler  or 
calipers.  All  baseline  evaluations  should  be  performed  as  closely  as  possible  to  the 
beginning  of  treatment  and  never  more  than  4  weeks  before  the  beginning  of  the 
treatment.  

 
•  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 

each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  

 
•  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules  and  palpable  lymph  nodes).  For  the  case  of  skin  lesions,  documentation  by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  

 
Methods of Measurement –  
 
•  CT  and  MRI  are  the  best  currently  available  and  reproducible  methods  to  measure 
target  lesions  selected  for  response  assessment.  Conventional  CT  and  MRI should  be 
performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should 
be  performed  using  a  5  mm  contiguous  reconstruction  algorithm.    This  applies  to 

121/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

tumors  of  the  chest,  abdomen  and  pelvis.  Head  and  neck  tumors  and  those  of 
extremities usually require specific protocols. 

 
•  Lesions  on  chest  X-ray  are  acceptable  as  measurable  lesions  when  they  are  clearly 

defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  

 
•  When  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  is  objective  response  evaluation,  ultrasound 
(US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative 
to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and 
thyroid  nodules.  US  might  also  be  useful  to  confirm  the  complete  disappearance  of 
superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination. 

 
•  The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet 
been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated 
equipment  and  a  high  level  of  expertise  that  may  only  be  available  in  some  centers. 
Therefore,  the  utilization  of  such  techniques  for  objective  tumor  response  should  be 
restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers. However, such techniques can 
be useful in confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained. 

 
•  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above 
the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response when all lesions have disappeared. 

 
•  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases 
(e.g.,  after  treatment  to  differentiate  between  residual  benign  lesions  and  residual 
malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors). 

 
Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Nontarget” lesions 
 
•  All  measurable  lesions  up  to  a  maximum  of  five  lesions  per  organ  and  10  lesions  in 
total,  representative  of  all  involved  organs  should  be  identified  as  target  lesions  and  
recorded and measured at baseline.  

 
•  Target  lesions  should  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  size  (lesions  with  the  longest 
diameter)  and  their  suitability  for  accurate  repeated  measurements  (either  by  imaging 
techniques or clinically).  

 
•  A  sum  of  the  longest  diameter  (LD)  for  all  target  lesions  will  be  calculated  and 
reported  as  the  baseline  sum  LD.  The  baseline  sum  LD  will  be  used  as  reference  by 
which to characterize the objective tumor. 

 
•  All  other  lesions  (or  sites  of  disease)  should  be  identified  as  nontarget  lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.

status should be confirmed later on by the review panel (or study chair).

Evaluation of best overall response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease  progression/recurrence  (taking  as  reference  for  PD  the  smallest  measurements 
recorded  since  the  treatment  started).  In  general,  the  patient's  best  response  assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria

•  Patients  with  a  global  deterioration  of  health  status  requiring  discontinuation  of 
treatment  without  objective  evidence  of  disease  progression  at  that  time  should  be 
classified  as  having  “symptomatic  deterioration”.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  

 
•  In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended  that  the  residual  lesion  be  investigated  (fine  needle  aspirate/biopsy)  to 
confirm the complete response status. 

 
Confirmation 
 
•  The  main  goal  of  confirmation  of  objective  response  is  to  avoid  overestimating  the 
response  rate  observed.    In  cases  where  confirmation  of  response  is  not  feasible,  it 
should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are 
not confirmed. 

 
•  To  be  assigned  a  status  of  PR  or  CR,  changes  in  tumor  measurements  must  be 
confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after 
the  criteria  for  response  are  first  met.  Longer  intervals  as  determined  by  the  study 
protocol may also be appropriate.  

 
•  In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once 
after  study  entry  at  a  minimum  interval  (in  general,  not  less  than  6-8  weeks)  that  is 
defined in the study protocol  

 

124/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

Duration of overall response 
 
•  The  duration  of  overall  response  is  measured  from  the  time  measurement  criteria  are 
met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence 
or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started. 

 
Duration of stable disease 
 
•  SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression 
are  met,  taking  as  reference  the  smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the  treatment 
started.  

 
•  The clinical relevance of the duration of SD varies for different tumor types and grades. 
Therefore, it is highly recommended that the protocol specify the minimal time interval 
required between two measurements for determination of SD. This time interval should 
take  into  account  the  expected  clinical  benefit  that  such  a  status  may  bring  to  the 
population under study.  

 
Response review 
 
•  For trials where the response rate is the primary endpoint it is strongly recommended 
that all responses be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study’s 
completion.  Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images is the 
best approach.  

 
Reporting of results 
 
•  All  patients included  in  the  study  must  be assessed for response to treatment, even if 
there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will 
be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 
3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death  from  toxicity,  7)  early  death  because  of  other  cause,  or  9)  unknown  (not 
assessable, insufficient data). 

 
•  All  of  the  patients  who  met  the  eligibility  criteria  should  be  included  in  the  main 
analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response categories 4-9 should be considered 
as  failing  to  respond  to  treatment (disease  progression).   Thus,  an incorrect treatment 
schedule  or  drug  administration  does  not  result  in  exclusion  from  the  analysis  of  the 
response rate.  Precise definitions for categories 4-9 will be protocol specific. 

 
•  All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. 
 
•  Subanalyses  may  then  be  performed  on  the  basis  of  a  subset  of  patients,  excluding 
those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to 

125/128 

CPR-EFC4972-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO  

other  reasons,  early  discontinuation  of  treatment,  major  protocol  violations,  etc.).  
However,  these  subanalyses  may  not  serve  as  the  basis  for  drawing  conclusions 
concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis 
should be clearly reported.   

 
•  The 95% confidence intervals should be provided.
