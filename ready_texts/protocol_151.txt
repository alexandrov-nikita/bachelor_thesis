Edition No.  1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

Objective 

Variable(s) 

To evaluate pulmonary symptom changes (in 
symptomatic US and Latin American patient 
population only) between ZD1839 and docetaxel 

To investigate the potential correlation between 
spirometry and pulmonary symptoms 

To evaluate patient-reported perceptions of 
treatment side effects between ZD1839 and 
docetaxel 

The proportion of patients with persistent 
improvement in one or more of the 
4 pulmonary items of the FACT-L LCS 
and group-average pulmonary scores (sum 
of all 4 LCS pulmonary items). 
Pulmonary symptom improvement must be 
demonstrated in the absence of clinically 
significant increases in the use of 
concomitant medications that, in the 
opinion of the investigator, could have 
resulted in symptom improvement. 

Evaluation of spirometry at two baseline 
measurements and at 6 weeks after 
initiation of study therapy 

Patient perception of treatment side effects 
as measured by one item (GP5) within the 
FACT-L PWB domain 

To evaluate changes in pain and fatigue (in 
symptomatic US and Latin American patient 
population only) between ZD1839 and docetaxel 

Changes in pain and fatigue as measured by 
the single items from the FACT-L PWB 
domain, weekly 

To evaluate a patient-reported global assessment of 
change in pulmonary symptoms between ZD1839 
and docetaxel, which will potentially provide an 
anchoring of the pulmonary symptoms endpoint to 
patient-perceived clinical benefit (in symptomatic 
US and Latin American patient population only) 

To evaluate the health care resource use by patients 
between ZD1839 and docetaxel 

Global assessment of change will be 
explored by asking patients weekly for the 
first 6 weeks if they feel their overall lung 
symptoms (referencing the 4 pulmonary 
items of the FACT-L LCS) are ‘better, 
about the same or worse’, since starting 
study medication 

Health care resource use including:  
inpatient hospital visits, outpatient visits, 
emergency room visits, doctor and nurse 
visits, medications, procedures, radiation 
therapy and supplemental oxygen use

Clinical Study Protocol:  Amended 
Study Code:  1839IL/0721 
Edition No.  1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

Study design 
Randomized, open-label, parallel group, international, multicenter, phase III study. 

Target patient population 
The study population will consist of patients aged (cid:152) 18 years with a life expectancy of at least 
8 weeks, who have histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC that is locally advanced or 
metastatic and not amenable to further surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent.  They 
must have progressive or recurrent disease following prior chemotherapy and be considered 
candidates for further chemotherapy with docetaxel.  Prior chemotherapy may have consisted 
of 1 or 2 regimens, but at least one must have been platinum-based.  Patients who initially 
presented with early stage disease but subsequently progressed or recurred are eligible if they 
received platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy or full cytotoxic doses of platinum therapy as 
part of a chemotherapy/radiotherapy regimen.  They will not be eligible if they have only 
received platinum at a radiosensitizing dosage.  Refractory to platinum and/or taxol is defined 
as progression on, or within, 3 months of completing platinum or taxol therapy. 

Patients will be recruited by investigational sites throughout the world that have expertise in 
treating patients with NSCLC.  At study entry, patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis 
using dynamic balancing (Pocock & Simon 1975) with respect to histology (adenocarcinoma 
vs. other), performance status (0-1 vs. 2), prior platinum therapy (refractory vs. received), 
prior paclitaxel therapy (refractory vs. received vs. none), prior regimens (1 vs. 2), smoking 
history (ever vs. never), and center. 

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration 
ZD1839 250 mg once daily in oral tablet form (one 250 mg per dose). 

Comparator, dosage and mode of administration 
Docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, intravenously over 1 hour. 

Duration of treatment 
Patients may continue to receive treatment with either ZD1839 or docetaxel until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or other specific criteria as defined in section 3.3.5.1. 

Statistical methods 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival between ZD1839 and 
docetaxel.  The goal is to demonstrate non-inferior or superior survival for ZD1839 compared 
with docetaxel. 

From TAX-317, the median survival for docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is 7.5 months, and for all 
patients randomized to best supportive care (BSC) it is 4.6 months (Shepherd et al 2000).  
There were approximately 45 and 77 deaths in the docetaxel and BSC arms, respectively.  
From these data, the estimated log hazard ratio (active-control effect size) for docetaxel to 
BSC is approximately 0.49 (-log 4.6/7.5) with a standard error of 0.18 (2/

45 +

77

).

Date:  14th September 2004 

The null hypothesis to be tested is that ZD1839 retains less than 50% of the active-control 
effect on survival.  The relative difference between the treatment arms will be analyzed by 
estimating a hazard ratio (ZD1839 to docetaxel) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) from an 
unadjusted proportional hazards model in the per-protocol (PP) population.  The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if the upper 95% CI limit for the log HR is less than k, where k is a 
constant (dependent on the number of observed events, the active-control effect size and its 
standard error) given by equation (10) in Rothmann et al 2003. 
If the null hypothesis of survival inferiority is rejected, then superior survival for ZD1839 will 
be declared relative to docetaxel if the lower 95% CI is above 1.0 (estimated in the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population) (closed test procedure per Morikawa & Yoshida 1995). 
The sample size goal is to have at least 85% power to reject the survival inferiority null 
hypothesis at a 2-sided 5% significance level versus the alternative hypothesis that the hazard 
ratio is 0.975.  This will require about 1150 observed patient failure times (Rothmann et al 
2003).  Approximately 1440 patients will be randomized.  Accrual is anticipated to take up to 
18 months with a concave cumulative distribution such that 50% of the target goal would be 
achieved by 12 months (67% total time).  Assuming exponential median survival of 6 months 
and 10% exponential loss to follow-up, sufficient events for the final analysis would be 
expected given a minimum follow-up of about 10 months (Lachin 1986). 
One interim survival analysis is planned to coincide with about 33% of the final survival 
analysis target events (~380 events).  The purpose of this analysis is to detect inferiority 
relating to the overall survival for ZD1839 relative to docetaxel. 
Overall survival will be compared as per the final analysis.  Considerations will be given to 
stop the study early if survival for ZD1839 is inferior to docetaxel at a 2-sided 10% 
significance level ie, the lower 90% CI for the survival hazard ratio (ZD1839:docetaxel) is 
greater than 1.0.  The analysis will have approximately 78% power when the true hazard ratio 
is 1.33, which corresponds to a median survival for docetaxel of 6 months versus 4.5 months 
for ZD1839.  Based on the sample size assumptions, the required cumulative events for the 
interim analysis are expected about 8 months prior to the end of recruitment. 
There will be no alpha adjustment for the final statistical analysis since there will be no 
opportunity at the interim to reject non-inferiority for overall survival. 
The sample size assumptions will be re-evaluated at the interim analysis based on the overall 
survival, pattern of recruitment, and loss to follow-up.  The minimum follow-up of the study 
may be revised as appropriate.

INTRODUCTION 

Investigators should be familiar with the Investigator Brochure. 

Background 

1.1 
ZD1839 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase.  Activation of the tyrosine kinase catalyses autophosphorylation and 
subsequent phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues, which then initiates a cellular signal 
transduction cascade.  Selective ZD1839 inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase results in 
interruption of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals responsible for cellular cancer processes 
such as proliferation, growth, metastases, angiogenesis and responsiveness to chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy. 

There is now considerable evidence of expression and over-expression of EGFR in an 
extensive range of human cancers eg, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as prostate, 
colorectal, head and neck, bladder, breast and gastric cancers.  Importantly, over-expression of 
EGFR has been correlated with poor prognosis features in many cases.  ZD1839 is currently 
being investigated as treatment for a range of human cancers. 

In phase I studies, ZD1839 has shown anti-tumor effects in patients with various solid tumors 
that were refractory to standard therapies or where no appropriate treatment was available, 
suggesting that ZD1839 may be useful in the treatment of various cancers. 

In global phase II studies (IDEAL 1 and 2), ZD1839 has demonstrated clinically significant 
anti-tumor activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have 
previously received chemotherapy.  In addition, ZD1839 palliated disease-related symptoms 
in these patients.  Two large randomised phase III studies (INTACT 1 and 2) of ZD1839 in 
combination with platinum based doublet chemotherapy regimens as first-line treatment in 
advanced NSCLC, failed to show a survival benefit over the doublet chemotherapy regimen 
alone.  The two chemotherapy regimens used were cisplatin and gemcitabine in INTACT 1, 
whilst carboplatin and paclitaxel was used in INTACT 2.  The safety profile of ZD1839 in the 
two studies was as expected from the monotherapy experience with no new major safety 
findings. 

Safety profile of ZD1839 

1.2 
For detailed safety information see the current version of the Investigator Brochure. 

As of May 2003, ZD1839 has been administered in clinical studies, expanded access or 
compassionate use or as a marketed drug, to approximately 75000 people worldwide. 

The majority of drug-related adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving ZD1839 (250 mg/day) 
monotherapy are mild and non-cumulative and rarely lead to withdrawal of ZD1839 therapy.  
The most commonly reported drug-related AEs, occurring in more than 20% of patients 
receiving ZD1839 250 mg/day are diarrhea, rash, pruritus, dry skin and acne.  Drug-related

AEs usually occur within the first month of therapy, infrequently require management and are 
generally reversible.  Approximately 8% of patients had a severe drug-related AE (National 
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, (NCI CTC) grade 3 or 4).  Only 1% of patients 
stopped therapy due to a drug-related AE. 

The frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in patients receiving ZD1839 
250 mg/day and the system/organ is shown in the table below:

a.  As of May 2003, approximately 75000 patients have received ZD1839 in worldwide clinical studies, 

expanded/compassionate use and post-marketing (Japan only).  Interstitial lung disease (ILD), 
regardless of cause, has been reported in patients treated with ZD1839, but is uncommon, with a 
worldwide frequency of approximately 1% (approximately 0.3% of 44000 patients exposed outside of 
Japan and approximately 2% of 31000 patients exposed in Japan).  This is lower than the frequency 
reported in association with other lung cancer therapies; the frequency in untreated patients with 
advanced NSCLC is unknown.  As of May 2003, ILD had a fatal outcome, whether deemed 
ZD1839-related or not, in 0.36% of this medically complex group of approximately 75000 patients 
receiving ZD1839 (0.09% outside of Japan; 0.73% in Japan).  The occurrence of both pulmonary 
toxicity and ILD was similar across all treatment arms in the placebo-controlled INTACT studies.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  

1.3 
Lung cancer is a common and lethal disease.  Worldwide, one million men and women die 
each year from advanced lung cancer.  In the US, it causes approximately 160000 deaths per 
year, which equates to one-third of all cancer-related deaths and more than for breast, colon 
and prostate cancers combined. 

Non-small cell histologies account for approximately 80% of all lung cancer cases (Landes et 
al 1999).  For patients with localised disease and no nodal involvement, 5-year survival rates 
of approximately 40% are expected with surgery.  Unfortunately, approximately 70% of 
patients with NSCLC present with advanced (stage III/IV) disease for which prognosis is 
poor.  With currently available treatments, the median survival for advanced stage IIIB or 
newly diagnosed stage IV NSCLC patients is only about 8 months, with a 1-year survival of 
approximately 35% (Ginsberg et al 1997). 

In a metanalysis of randomized study data, platinum-based chemotherapy has been shown to 
offer a modest survival benefit over best supportive care (BSC) (NSCLC Collaborative Group 
1995) and is now considered the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients with advanced 
stage IIIB or stage IV NSCLC.  The chemotherapy regimens most commonly prescribed 
consist of a platinum agent (cisplatin or carboplatin) combined with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, 
vinorelbine or docetaxel.  Recent large randomized studies (Schiller et al 2002, Scagliotti et al 
2001, Kelly et al 2001) have failed to demonstrate clear therapeutic advantage for any 
particular “doublet” chemotherapy regimen. 

Following first-line chemotherapy, the vast majority of patients will subsequently progress 
and some of these patients will be considered fit for additional, second-line, chemotherapy.  A 
large number of single arm, phase II studies of second line chemotherapy have been 
conducted but there has not been a clear correlation between response rate and survival in 
these phase II or in subsequent phase III studies.  Furthermore, despite the largely palliative 
intent of therapy in this recurrent setting, changes in clinically relevant endpoints such as 
disease-related symptoms and quality of life (QoL) assessment have generally not been 
included (Huisman et al 2000). 

The most extensively investigated drug is docetaxel which, in four phase II studies enrolling 
240 patients at a dose of 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, demonstrated objective tumor response 
rates of 14% to 22% and median survival time from 7 months to 11 months.  A further small 
study of 20 patients who received docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, reported a response 
rate of 20%, median survival of 11 months and 1-year survival of 18% (Fossella et al 2002). 

Based on these phase II results, two randomized phase III studies were undertaken in patients 
with advanced NSCLC who had Eastern Co-operative Group (ECOG) performance status 
(PS) 0 to 2 and had previously been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.  The first 
study compared docetaxel plus BSC with BSC alone (Shepherd et al 2000) whereas the 
second study compared docetaxel with either single agent vinorelbine or single agent 
ifosfamide (Fossella et al 2000).

Docetaxel plus BSC versus BSC alone 

1.4 
The initial design of the docetaxel plus BSC versus BSC alone study included docetaxel at a 
dose of 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.  However, approximately half way through the study, the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee identified a higher toxic death rate among the patients 
randomized to receive docetaxel.  The study was subsequently amended to reduce the 
docetaxel dose to 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and study data were analyzed and reported 
separately for the two different docetaxel doses.  In the first portion of the study, 49 patients 
received docetaxel (100 mg/m2) plus BSC and 51 patients BSC alone.  Following the 
amendment an additional 55 patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2) plus BSC and 49 patients 
BSC alone.  

Objective partial response (PR) was observed in 6% of all patients who received docetaxel 
with disease control rates (PR + stable disease (SD)) of 53% and 44% for patients at 
100 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 respectively.  Median time to progression (TTP) was significantly 
longer in patients who received docetaxel plus BSC than those receiving BSC alone; the 
difference being more marked for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 (12.3 weeks vs. 7.0 weeks 
p=0.004) than those treated at 100 mg/m2 (9.1 weeks vs. 5.9 weeks p=0.037).  Median 
survival of patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 was not significantly different from that of 
patients receiving BSC alone (median 5.9 months vs. 4.9 months p=0.871).  However, for 
patients who received docetaxel 75 mg/m2, there was a significant improvement in both 
median and 1-year survival when compared with those who received BSC alone (7.5 months 
vs. 4.6 months p=0.01 and 37% vs. 11% p=0.003). 

It was concluded that QoL, assessed using both the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) and 
the EORTC QoL instrument, demonstrated significant advantage for docetaxel-treated 
patients in several areas including pain, weight loss and PS (Dancey J et al 2004).  Patients 
who received docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 also required less opioid and non-opioid analgesics and 
palliative radiotherapy than patients who received BSC alone. 

Hematologic toxicity was greater among patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 than those 
receiving 75 mg/m2, with five toxic deaths occurring at the higher dose level.  The median 
number of cycles at 100 mg/m2 was two compared with four at 75 mg/m2.  Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia was reported in 67% and febrile neutropenia in 2% of the 55 patients treated at 
75 mg/m2.  With the exception of infection, the incidence of non-hematologic toxicity was 
comparable between the docetaxel and BSC arms.  It was notable that asthenia, commonly 
attributed to docetaxel, was actually seen more frequently in the BSC arm. 

Docetaxel versus Vinorelbine or Ifosfamide 

1.5 
In this study, docetaxel administered at a dose of either 75 mg/m2 or 100 mg/m2 was 
compared with single agent vinorelbine (30 mg/m2 day 1 and day 8 q 21) or ifosfamide 
(2 g/m2 day 1 to day 3 q 21).  Of the 373 patients enrolled, 250 received docetaxel (125 each 
at 100 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2) and 123 received either vinorelbine (89 patients) or ifosfamide 
(34 patients).

Objective PRs were significantly more frequent in the patients treated with docetaxel at 
100 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 than with vinorelbine or ifosfamide (11% vs. 7% vs. 1% p=0.001 
and p=0.036 respectively). 

The median TTP was similar across the three arms of the study (around 8 weeks) but 26-week 
progression-free survival was significantly better in either docetaxel arm than in the 
vinorelbine/ifosfamide arm (p<0.05).  The survival for the initial 6 months and the median 
survival were similar across the three arms of the study.  However, the 1-year survival was 
significantly better in the docetaxel 75 mg/m2 arm than in the vinorelbine/ifosfamide arm 
(32% vs. 19% p=0.025).  The 1-year survival estimate for the docetaxel 100 mg/m2 arm (21%) 
was similar to that for the vinorelbine/ifosfamide arm.  A further survival analysis was 
undertaken that censored survival at the time when a patient received additional cytotoxic 
therapy following progression.  This analysis showed that the 1-year survival rates for both 
docetaxel arms (32% for each arm) were significantly better than for the 
vinorelbine/ifosfamide arm (10% p<0.01). 

The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia (77% at 100 mg/m2 and 54% at 75 mg/m2) and febrile 
neutropenia (12% at 100 mg/m2 and 8% at 75 mg/m2) was higher in the docetaxel arms than in 
the vinorelbine/ifosfamide arm (30% and 1% respectively).  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was 
uncommon.  Non-hematologic toxicity was similar across the treatment arms.  There were 
four treatment-related deaths, two in the vinorelbine/ifosfamide arm and two in the docetaxel 
100 mg/m2 arm. 

QoL and symptom assessment showed a consistent trend in favor of the docetaxel arms.  
Appetite, symptom distress and overall QoL were better in patients receiving either 75 mg/m2 
or 100 mg/m2 than in patients receiving vinorelbine/ifosfamide and there was a positive trend 
for pain, dyspnea, fatigue and activity.  Only cough and hemoptysis favored the 
vinorelbine/ifosfamide arm.  The proportion of patients who experienced 10% or greater 
weight loss was significantly lower in the docetaxel 75 mg/m2 arm and a similar difference 
was found in the requirement for palliative radiotherapy. 

On the basis of the results from these two randomized studies, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 
3 weeks has been licensed worldwide for use in previously treated NSCLC.  However, 
although both studies were randomised, it should be noted that: 

1.  TTP and one year survival for the docetaxel 75 mg/m2 arm in the study of docetaxel plus 

BSC vs. BSC was comparable to that reported for first-line patients receiving doublet 
chemotherapy.  Moreover, it was markedly better than for the docetaxel 75 mg/m2 arm in 
the subsequent, larger randomized study versus vinorelbine or ifosfamide. 

2.  In the study comparing docetaxel to ifosfamide/vinorelbine median survival for docetaxel 

and single agent vinorelbine or ifosfamide was not significantly different and one-year 
survival differences were based on non-prospectively defined statistical analyses. 

3.  The docetaxel plus BSC vs. BSC study only, enrolled patients who were taxane-naïve, 

whereas the study of docetaxel vs. vinorelbine/ifosfamide included patients who had

previously received paclitaxel.  In this latter study, there was no apparent difference in the 
outcome for patients who were taxane-naïve versus those who had received prior 
paclitaxel, and the docetaxel license made no stipulation concerning prior paclitaxel 
therapy. 

4.  Patients in both studies were stratified with respect to their response to prior platinum 

therapy (refractory vs. resistant).  In the TAX317 study, approximately 18% of patients 
randomized to both 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel had progressive disease as their 
best response to cisplatin, while 20% of patients randomized to best supportive care had 
progressive disease as their best response to cisplatin.  The remainder of the patients in all 
treatment groups had either objective response or stable disease as their best response to 
cisplatin.  In this study, no patient who responded to docetaxel had progressed while on 
platinum-based chemotherapy.  In an author update to this study, it was shown that 
patients who were refractory to their prior platinum-based chemotherapy had a longer 
survival if they were treated with docetaxel compared to those patients treated only with 
best supportive care (Shepherd F et al 2001).  This suggests that even in the absence of 
response, there can be a survival benefit with disease stabilization from docetaxel 
administered in the second-line setting (Shepherd F, personal communication, 2004).  In 
the TAX320 study, 33% of the patients randomized to docetaxel 100 mg/m2 and 24% of 
patients randomized to docetaxel 75 mg/m2 had progressive disease as their best response 
to prior platinum therapy, while 32% of patients randomized to the control arm had 
progressive disease as their best response to prior platinum therapy.  The remainder of the 
patients in all of the treatment groups had either objective response or stable disease as 
their best response to prior platinum therapy.  There was a trend toward a higher partial 
response rate with docetaxel for patients who were platinum-resistant (10%) compared 
with those who were platinum refractory (5%).  Survival for the docetaxel 100 mg/m2 
group and the control groups also favored patients whose disease was platinum-resistant, 
although there was no such relationship for the patients treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2. 

No cytotoxic chemotherapy agent has been systematically evaluated in third-line NSCLC but 
ZD1839 has been licensed in that setting.  A recent retrospective review from MD Anderson 
Cancer Center and Institute Gustave Roussy indicated a response rate of only 2.3% among 
43 patients treated with a wide variety of cytotoxic agents in the third-line setting (Massarelli 
et al 2003).  The median survival for this group of patients was only 5.4 months, which is little 
different than might be expected for patients who received BSC only. 

ZD1839 in Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 

1.6 
Two dose-randomised, double blind, multicenter phase II studies, (Study 16/IDEAL 1 and 
Study 39/IDEAL 2) investigated the activity of ZD1839 250 mg and 500 mg/day in patients 
with previously treated NSCLC.  These studies included efficacy endpoints of both objective 
tumor response and alterations in disease-related symptoms. 

In Study 39 (Kris et al 2002), which was undertaken only in the US, patients were required to 
have received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, which must have included a platinum 
and docetaxel, either sequentially or concurrently.  In addition patients must have been

refractory (defined as progressing during or within 90 days of completing) or intolerant to 
their most recent chemotherapy regimen.  This study had co-primary endpoints of objective 
tumor response rate and rate of disease-related symptom improvement, the latter being 
assessed by the LCS of the FACT-L.  In order to ensure that all patients could be evaluated for 
disease-related symptom improvement, the LCS score at baseline (which would be 28 for 
asymptomatic and 0 for maximally symptomatic patients) was required to be < 24.  Patient 
reported LCS scores were recorded weekly and FACT L scores monthly.  Disease-related 
symptom improvement was prospectively defined as a 2-point increase over baseline in LCS 
score recorded at 2 assessments at least 28 days apart with no interval deterioration to more 
than 1 point below baseline. 

Objective tumor response was seen in 11.8% of the patients in Study 39 who received 
ZD1839 250 mg/day and a further 30.4% demonstrated stable disease.  On the basis of the 
predefined LCS score criteria, disease-related symptom improvement was demonstrated in 
approximately 43% of the patients who received ZD1839 250 mg/day.  Symptom 
improvement occurred rapidly in most patients, generally becoming evident within 1-2 weeks 
of commencing ZD1839, prior to the initial objective tumor evaluation by the investigator. 

There was a clear correlation between disease-related symptom improvement and objective 
tumor response, the vast majority of patients who achieved partial response (96%) or stable 
disease (71%) also demonstrating disease-related symptom improvement.  Conversely, only a 
minority of patients (17%) with a best response of progressive disease demonstrated 
improvement in disease-related symptoms.  

The magnitude of improvement in disease-related symptoms appeared to correlate with the 
level of tumor response.  The numerical magnitude of LCS score improvement was greater in 
patients with a partial response than those with stable disease.  Patients with stable disease, in 
turn, demonstrated a greater magnitude of improvement than patients with progressive 
disease. 

Additionally, patients who demonstrated improvement in their disease-related symptoms 
tended to have longer progression-free survival and overall survival than patients whose 
symptoms did not improve. 

The design of the second phase II study (Study 16/IDEAL 1) was similar to that of Study 39 
but enrolled less heavily pre-treated patients (either 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens with 
at least 1 having contained a platinum) and was undertaken in Europe, Australia, South Africa 
and Japan. 

Amongst the patients in Study 16 who received ZD1839 250 mg/day, 18.4% achieved an 
objective tumor response and a further 37% demonstrated SD.  Disease-related symptom 
improvement was demonstrated in 40.3% of the patients treated with ZD1839 250 mg/day. As 
in Study 39, symptom improvement occurred rapidly in most patients. 

Data from Study 16 also demonstrated a clear correlation between disease-related symptom 
improvement and objective tumor response.  Most patients who achieved partial response

(78%) or SD (53%) also demonstrated disease-related symptom improvement but this only 
occurred in a minority of patients (13%) with a best response of progressive disease. 

As in Study 39, the numerical magnitude of LCS score improvement correlated with the level 
of tumor response and patients who demonstrated improvement in their disease-related 
symptoms tended to have longer progression-free survival and overall survival than patients 
whose symptoms did not improve. 

 

Rationale for this study 

1.7 
The outlook for patients with recurrent advanced NSCLC is poor, with a median survival of 
approximately 4 months to 6 months at the time of first recurrence. 

Two separate randomized phase III studies have demonstrated an improvement in overall 
survival for docetaxel compared with either BSC or other single agent chemotherapy in this 
clinical setting, and docetaxel has been licensed for the treatment of patients who have 
previously received platinum-based chemotherapy.  In two uncontrolled randomized phase II 
studies, ZD1839 has demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patients with previously 
treated advanced NSCLC.  This was manifested both as objective tumor responses and 
improvement in disease-related symptoms and was achieved with a modest safety profile and 
an absence of many of the toxicities typically associated with classic cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
A randomized study is necessary to demonstrate that overall survival, the primary efficacy 
endpoint for this study, achieved with ZD1839 is not worse than that achieved with docetaxel, 
the current standard of care in patients with refractory NSCLC who have previously received 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 

The population for this study will consist of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who 
have previously received definitive treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and for 
whom docetaxel is the reasonable treatment option.  It is anticipated that this will primarily 
include patients who have received only one prior treatment regimen, but it may also include 
patients who have received two prior treatment regimens but who have not yet received 
docetaxel. 

The study will have a randomized, open-label, parallel arm, phase III design and will compare 
ZD1839 monotherapy 250 mg/day orally with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 
3 weeks with primary endpoint of overall survival.

STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 

(cid:156) 

3. 

Overall study design 

3.1 
This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III, multicenter international study.  
The total number of patients expected to be exposed to study procedures is approximately 
1440.  Patients will be recruited by investigational sites throughout the world that have 
expertise in treating patients with NSCLC. 

Patients will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

 

 

ZD1839 250 mg/day, orally  

Docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, intravenously over 1 hour 

The target population will be patients who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy, 
have progressive or recurrent disease and are now considered candidates for further 
chemotherapy with docetaxel.  Refractory to platinum and/or taxol is defined as progression 
on, or within, 3 months of completing platinum or taxol therapy.  At study entry, patients will 
be randomized on a 1:1 basis using dynamic balancing (Pocock & Simon 1975) with respect 
to histology (adenocarcinoma vs. other), performance status (0-1 vs. 2), prior platinum therapy 
(refractory vs. received), prior paclitaxel therapy (refractory vs. received vs. none), prior 
regimens (1 vs. 2), smoking history (ever vs. never), and center. 

Patients may continue to receive treatment with either ZD1839 or docetaxel until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or the occurrence of any of the other specific criteria 
defined in section 3.3.5.1. 

It is anticipated that, in the majority of patients, disease progression will be defined 
radiologically.  If an investigator believes that a patient has convincing evidence of “clinical 
progression” (for example worsening of PS that is clearly cancer related) but, despite adequate 
imaging, it is not possible to document objective radiological progression, the patient should 
be discussed with the AstraZeneca Clinical Study Team (CST) physician and a decision on 
discontinuation of study therapy made on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, radiological 
progression alone need not necessarily require the withdrawal of study therapy if, following 
discussion with the AstraZeneca CST physician, the patient is still deemed to be deriving 
clinical benefit. 

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be appointed to review the interim 
efficacy analysis during the course of the study.

The study plan (Table 2) indicates the number and timing of the planned visits.  The principal 
investigator/sub-investigator should adhere to the study plan, procedures and perform 
tests/observations according to the protocol.  For the purpose of this study, one cycle equals 
21 days and time occurs in 3-week blocks.  Any assessments/visits after screening should be 
performed within a window of plus or minus 3 working days of the scheduled visit date.  If 
selected screening evaluations are done within 7 days of Day 1, Cycle 1 of treatment, and are 
acceptable for study entry, they do not have to be repeated on Day 1 unless the investigator 
believes that they are likely to have significantly changed.

Footnotes to Study Plan 

a.  A full medical and surgical history should be obtained to include all relevant conditions.  Specific enquiries 

must be made regarding previous and existing history of pulmonary disease and/or systemic conditions 
associated with pulmonary involvement eg, connective tissue disease.  Questions regarding smoking history 
will be obtained at screening only. 

b.  At screening, spirometry assessment must be conducted as two separate measurements in all patients to 

allow comparison in patients with worsening of respiratory symptoms of unknown etiology.  The first may 
be up to 21 days prior to randomization, the second must be within 7 days prior to randomization.  The two 
spirometry assessments must not be conducted on the same day.  Subsequent spirometries will be performed 
at visit 4 and then again if clinically indicated.  This data will be recorded on additional case report forms 
(CRFs) to be provided. 

c.  Pre-menopausal women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 

7 days before Day 1 of treatment.  If the results are positive, the patient is ineligible for the study.  In the 
event of suspected pregnancy during the study, the test should be repeated. 

d. 

If assessed within 7 days before randomization and meets the stated eligibility criteria (if applicable), it need 
not be repeated on Day 1 of cycle 1 unless investigator believes that it is likely to have changed 
significantly. 

e.  Physical examination includes heart rate, blood pressure, height, weight and neurological examination.  

After height at screening has been obtained, it is not necessary to repeat height unless clinically indicated.  
Weight should be measured at screening, Day 1 of each cycle and as clinically indicated. 

f.  Data collection on concomitant medication includes information on dose, route, schedule, start date, 

indication, stop date and reason for stopping, and will continue for 1 month after withdrawal from 
randomised study medication.  Also for symptomatic patients in all US and Latin American centers only, 
patient-reported changes in the use of ‘as required’ (PRN) bronchodilators, cough suppressant & 
expectorants, opiates and oxygen are collected weekly.  This information will be made available to the 
treating physician for each 3-weekly clinic visit.  In conjunction with information on regularly prescribed 
medications, the treating physician will then make an assessment of whether any concomitant medication 
changes in any of the previous 3 weeks could have resulted in clinically meaningful pulmonary symptom 
improvement. 

g.  Screening hematology/biochemistry/urinalysis are assessed within 7 days of randomization.  Subsequent 

hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis assessments should be done at Day 1 of each cycle and at 
discontinuation within plus or minus 3 days, and when clinically indicated.  Hematology will be assessed on 
a weekly basis and as clinically indicated for patients receiving docetaxel.  See section 4.7.2 for specific list 
of laboratory analyses to be done at the beginning of each cycle. 

h. 

If tissue samples or slides are available, and plasma and urine samples taken for biomarker analysis, see 
Appendix E.  Samples are only to be collected from patients who consented to biomarker research.

i.  The specific imaging modality will be at the discretion of individual investigators but screening assessment 
must be able to define adequately all areas of disease and to document measurable disease according to the 
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.  Subsequent, repeat imaging (every 
6 weeks as per the study plan) should follow the RECIST guidelines, which requires the same method of 
assessment and the same technique to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at screening 
and during follow-up.  Additional scans for confirmation of CR and PR will not be routinely undertaken.  
Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  Suggested imaging 
would include: Computerized Tomography (CT) scan with contrast of the chest and upper abdomen to 
include the adrenal glands bilaterally, brain CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast (in 
symptomatic patients), chest X-ray, bone scan (if assessment shows new areas of abnormal uptake, then 
areas of disease must be confirmed by X-ray), MRI of the spine with gadolinium contrast (for suspected 
spinal cord compression).  Any patient who discontinues from study treatment for reasons other than disease 
progression (except for withdrawal of consent by the patient) should continue to have objective tumor 
assessments every 6 weeks in order to collect information on progression of disease.  Target and non-target 
lesions should be selected from the baseline scan and documented on the RECIST modules prior to 
performing the first follow-up scan. 

j.  All patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (Functional assessment of Cancer Therapy for Lung Cancer 

(FACT-L), perception of treatment side effects, PRF, pain & fatigue, Global Assessment of Change in 
Pulmonary Symptoms) will be collected.  Collection of PROs will continue for 1 month after discontinuation 
from study therapy, except for the Global Assessment of Change, which will only be collected for the first 
6 weeks following instigation of study therapy.  Weekly questionnaires will be completed by 
symptomatic patients in all US and Latin American centers only (for the definition of a symptomatic 
patient see section 4.6.3.1). 

k.  Weekly questionnaires will be completed by symptomatic patients in all US and Latin American centers 

only.  Weekly questionnaires will consist of the LCS domain of the FACT-L, FACT-L questions on pain and 
fatigue, the perception of treatment side effects question, and the Global Assessment of Change in 
Pulmonary Symptoms question.  Patients will use paper questionnaires to answer the weekly questionnaires.  
Patients should commence completing weekly questionnaires on day 8 of cycle 1. 

l.  Baseline FACT-L questionnaires should be given to patients at screening (day -7 through day 0).  

Subsequent questionnaires should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle, at the time of discontinuation of 
study therapy, and at one month after discontinuation.  The Global Assessment of Change will not be part of 
the baseline questionnaire.  FACT-L will only be collected in those countries that have a validated 
translation. 

m.  Health care resource use should be collected at screening, Day 1 of each cycle, at any unscheduled visit that 
requires the patient to see a physician or nurse, and at discontinuation of study therapy.  Health care resource 
use will also be followed for 1 month after discontinuation. 

n. 

In the event of any subjective eye symptoms or new or worsening respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, 
breathlessness), appropriate medical advice should be sought promptly.  Any symptoms should be treated as 
clinically indicated and reported as an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) if appropriate.

o.  AEs must be collected from the time of consent.  After discontinuation, all ongoing study-related AEs or 

SAEs must be followed until resolution where possible unless, in the investigator’s opinion, the condition is 
unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease.  All new AEs and SAEs occurring during the 
30 calendar days after the last dose of study drug must be reported (if SAEs, they must be reported to 
AstraZeneca within 24 hours) and followed to resolution as above. 

p.  After discontinuation from the study for any reason (except for withdrawal of consent by the patient), the 

patient, patient’s family, or the patient’s current physician must be contacted every 8 weeks for survival 
information.  In addition, all subsequent anticancer therapy treatments will be collected during this time, 
until death.  A statement of death form should be submitted at any point during the study when a patient has 
died. 

q.  ZD1839 will be dispensed every 3 months (4 cycles) while on study and any unused ZD1839 should be 

returned. 

Rationale for study design, doses and control groups 
Dose 

3.2 
3.2.1 
In the two large phase II studies (IDEAL 1 and 2) comparing the 250 mg/day and 500 mg/day 
dose levels of ZD1839 in patients with previously treated NSCLC, response rates, disease 
control rates, and symptom improvement rates were similar for each dose, while the incidence 
of drug-related AEs was clearly lower at the 250 mg/day dose than at the 500 mg/day dose.  
Therefore, 250 mg/day is considered to be the appropriate dose of ZD1839 in patients with 
previously treated NSCLC. 

In the two randomised phase III studies of docetaxel in NSCLC patients previously treated 
with platinum-based chemotherapy, two docetaxel doses were investigated (100 mg/m2 every 
3 weeks and 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks).  Patients treated at the lower dose of 75 mg/m2 every 
3 weeks experienced less toxicity and longer survival.  Based on these data, 75 mg/m2 is the 
licensed dose for patients with previously treated NSCLC and is the appropriate docetaxel 
dose for use in this study. 

Overall survival 

3.2.2 
The patients eligible for this study will be those with recurrent, previously treated, locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC who would be considered candidates for further chemotherapy 
with docetaxel.  There is no known curative therapy for these patients but docetaxel has 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival when compared to 
BSC.  For this study, it is hypothesized that overall survival in those patients who receive 
ZD1839 is not worse than in those patients who receive docetaxel.

Radiological, objective progression of disease.  If an investigator believes that a 
patient has convincing evidence of “clinical progression” (for example worsening of 
PS that is clearly cancer related) but, despite adequate imaging, it is not possible to 
document objective radiological progression, the patient should be discussed with 
the AstraZeneca CST physician and a decision on discontinuation of study therapy 
made on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, radiological progression alone need 
not necessarily require the withdrawal of study therapy if, following discussion with 
the AstraZeneca CST physician, the patient is still deemed to be deriving clinical 
benefit. 

Death 

Patient lost to follow-up 

Other (investigator’s discretion) 

3.3.5.2  Procedures for discontinuation 
Patients who discontinue should always be asked about the reason(s) for their discontinuation 
and about the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they should be seen and assessed by an 
investigator(s).  The reason for discontinuation and the date of discontinuation (date of last 
dose) must be documented on the CRF.  If possible, any questionnaires (eg, for QoL 
assessments) should be completed and any remaining investigational products should be 
returned by the patient. 

All patients who have new or worsening CTC grade 3 or 4 laboratory values at the time of 
discontinuation must have further tests performed and the results recorded on the appropriate 
CRF until the laboratory values have returned to CTC grade 1 or 2, unless these values are not 
likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In these cases, the investigators must 
record their opinions on the CRFs and in the patient’s medical records.  Laboratory 
abnormalities should not be reported as AEs unless any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled, the 
laboratory abnormality causes the patient to discontinue from the study, or the investigator 
insists the abnormality should be reported as an AE. 

At discontinuation all on-going study-related toxicities and SAEs must be followed until 
resolution unless, in the investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the 
patient’s underlying disease. 

After discontinuation from treatment, patients must be followed up for all existing and new 
AEs for 30 calendar days after the last dose of study drug.  All new AEs and SAEs occurring 
during the 30 calendar days after the last dose of study drug must be reported (if SAEs they 
must be reported to AstraZeneca within 24 hours) and followed to resolution as above.  They 
will also immediately inform AstraZeneca of the discontinuation.  Any SAE should be 
communicated to AstraZeneca according to the procedures defined in section 4.7.

Edition Number 1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

Any patient who discontinues from study treatment for reasons other than progression (except 
for voluntary discontinuation by the patient) should continue to have objective tumor 
assessments every 6 weeks in order to collect information on progression of disease. 

When disease progression has been documented, the long-term follow up information for 
survival should be collected at least every 8 weeks by telephone contact with the patient, 
patient’s family, or by contact with the patient’s current physician.  In addition, all subsequent 
chemotherapy, radiation, surgical or other anticancer therapy during the time until death is to 
be recorded.  A statement of death form should be submitted at any point during the study 
when a patient has died. 

Treatments 
3.4 
3.4.1 
Investigational products 
3.4.1.1  Presentation of ZD1839 
AstraZeneca will supply ZD1839 to the investigator as brown, film-coated round-shaped 
tablets for use as follows: 

 

Strength (mg)  Formulation Number 

ZD1839  250 mg tablet 

 

Descriptive information for ZD1839 can be found in the Investigator Brochure. 

For all centers, tablets will be packed in high-density polyethylene bottles with child-resistant 
closures.  Each bottle will contain 100 tablets, sufficient for 4-cycles supply plus overage.  
ZD1839 will be dispensed to patients in the AstraZeneca packaging provided: packaging 
includes bottles, caps and label.  Bottle tamper-evident seals should not be broken prior to 
dispensing to a patient. 

3.4.1.2  ZD1839 dose and treatment regimen 
The ZD1839 dose level for this study is 250 mg and will be dispensed as a 4-cycle (3 months) 
supply.  Study treatment will be dispensed to patients on Day 1 of cycle 1 and every 4 cycles 
thereafter, until discontinuation of study therapy.  Patients receiving ZD1839 should maintain 
a 21-day cycle whenever possible to ensure consistency on both treatment arms. 

On Day 1 of the first cycle, ZD1839 should be administered during the clinic visit.  
Subsequently, ZD1839 treatment will be taken once a day, every day about the same time.  It 
can be taken with or without food.  If the patient forgets to take a dose they should take the 
missed dose as soon as they remember, as long as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose is 
due.  If the patient has emesis within 30 minutes of taking a dose, the dose may be repeated as 
long as this is done at least 12 hours before the next dose is due. 

If doses are regularly missed during any treatment period, AstraZeneca must be informed and 
the patient noted as non-compliant on the CRFs.  Severely non-compliant patients may be 
excluded from some per-protocol (PP) analyses and may be discontinued from the study.

3.4.1.3  Labelling 
Each bottle of ZD1839 will have an investigational-use label permanently affixed to the 
outside, stating that the drug is for clinical study use only and should be kept out of reach of 
children.  Instructions stating that the tablet should be taken as a single dose orally at the same 
time each day will be included.  Labels will include blank lines for enrolment code (E-code) 
and date dispensed.  Each label will also include a tear-off portion that should be applied to 
the CRF upon dispensing. 

Storage of ZD1839 

3.4.1.4 
For all centers, the tablets must be stored in a lockable storage area. 

For ROW centers the tablets must be stored below 30°C. 

For US centers the tablets must be stored at controlled room temperature between 20ºC and 
25ºC. 

For Canadian centers the tablets must be stored between 15ºC and 30ºC. 

3.4.1.5  ZD1839 accountability 
It is the investigator/institution’s responsibility to establish a system for handling study 
treatments, including investigational products, so as to ensure that: 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

Deliveries of such products from AstraZeneca are correctly received by a 
responsible person (eg, a pharmacist) 

Deliveries are recorded 

Study treatments are handled and stored safely and properly 

Study treatments are dispensed only to study patients in accordance with the 
protocol 

Site staff should check the study drug at each patient visit to ensure that the patient 
is taking the tablets as directed 

Patients must return all unused medication and empty containers to the investigator 

At the end of the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage 
and destroyed/returned stock.  Records of usage should include the patient initials and E-code 
of the person to whom the study treatment was dispensed, the quantity and date of dispensing, 
and unused study treatment returned to the investigator.  This record is in addition to any drug 
accountability information recorded on the CRFs.  Any discrepancies must be accounted for 
on the appropriate form.  Certificates of delivery and return must be signed, preferably by the 
investigator or a pharmacist, and copies retained in the Investigator File.

Study Code 1839IL/0721  
Edition Number 1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

After drug accountability has been completed by the AstraZeneca monitor, all unused or 
returned medication should be destroyed at site wherever possible (except in the US, see 
below).  In the event that this is not possible the medication should be returned to the local 
distribution center for destruction. 

For US centers please return the medication to: 
USI 

 

 

Each time ZD1839 is dispensed to a patient, the dispenser should complete the patient E-code 
and the date dispensed on the label.  The tear-off label should be attached to the patient drug 
accountability CRF, and the relevant box initialled on the CRF.  Patient drug accountability 
CRFs will be checked by the monitor at each monitoring visit. 

3.4.1.6  Presentation of comparator/chemotherapy 
Docetaxel is manufactured commercially as Taxotere® by Aventis.  It is sterile, 
non-pyrogenic, and available in single-dose vials containing 20 mg (0.5 ml) or 80 mg (2.0 ml) 
docetaxel (anhydrous).  Each ml contains 40 mg docetaxel (anhydrous) and 1040 mg 
polysorbate 80.  Taxotere (docetaxel) Injection Concentrate requires dilution prior to use, and 
the Injection Concentrate is accompanied by a vial containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, 
single-dose diluent of 13% ethanol in water for this purpose, and is supplied in 1.5 ml and 
6.0 ml vials. 

3.4.1.7  Docetaxel doses and treatment regimens 
Patients will receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2, administered intravenously over 1 hour, every 
3 weeks (1 cycle = 21 days).  If excessive toxicity or side effects are observed at this dose, 
patients may receive a dose reduction to docetaxel 60 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles. 

Docetaxel doses will be calculated using the patient’s actual height and weight to determine 
the patient’s body surface area (BSA) using the DuBois and DuBois formula below: 

BSA = 0.007184 x Weight (kg)0.425 x Height (cm)0.725 

Each required dose will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number. 

The appropriate number of vials for docetaxel injection concentrate should stand at room 
temperature for approximately 5 minutes.  The contents of the diluent vials are then 
transferred in a sterile manner to docetaxel injection concentrate vials yielding a concentration 
of 10 mg of docetaxel/ml.  This solution should be clear.  This initial diluted docetaxel is then 
injected into a 250 ml infusion bag/bottle of either 0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% 
dextrose solution to produce a final concentration of 0.3 mg docetaxel/ml to 
0.74 mg docetaxel/ml.

Do not refrigerate the reconstituted docetaxel, as a precipitate will form.  For stability and 
storage of reconstituted vials and infusion bag refer to local data sheets (see Appendix F). 

Anti-emetics should be administered in conjunction with docetaxel.  Anti-emetic treatment 
should be administered to patients from the first cycle and the prophylactic use of a 5HT3 
antagonist is recommended.  All patients should be pre-medicated with oral corticosteroids 
(dexamethasone 8 mg orally twice daily) for 3 days starting 24 hours prior to docetaxel 
infusion to reduce the incidence of fluid retention and severity of hypersensitivity reactions.  
Alternative corticosteroid pre-medication may be considered for individual patients if 
contraindications exist to the regimen described above.  Investigators should discuss 
alternative pre-medication with the AstraZeneca CST physician. 

Screening 

3.4.2  Method of assigning patients to treatment groups 
3.4.2.1 
As patients are screened for the study, they must be allocated an E-code.  The E-code is a 
7 digit number made up of the center number and the patient number within that particular 
center eg, the first patient screened at center number 0025 would be assigned the E-code 
E0025001, the second patient screened would be E0025002 and so on.  This number is the 
patient’s unique identifier and is used to identify the patient on the CRFs.  When a patient is 
entered into screening, the investigator should contact the Centralized 
Registration/Randomisation Center (ClinPhone) by telephone to register the patient.  All 
screened patients are assigned an E-code irrespective of whether or not they are subsequently 
randomized to receive study treatment. 

The actual treatment given to individual patients will be determined by a randomisation 
scheme prepared by the Biostatistics Group, AstraZeneca.  Patient eligibility will be 
established before treatment randomisation.  Patients will be randomised strictly sequentially, 
as patients are eligible for enrolment/randomisation.  Patient randomisation numbers which 
identify the treatment assigned to an individual patient will be allocated as patients enter the 
study. 

3.4.2.2  Randomization 
Once the eligibility of a patient has been confirmed, the investigator (or nominated assistant) 
should contact the Centralized Registration/ Randomization Center (ClinPhone) by telephone 
for the issue of a patient randomization code and allocation of randomized therapy.  Patients 
will be randomised on a 1:1 basis using dynamic balancing (Pocock & Simon 1975) with 
respect to histology (adenocarcinoma vs. other), performance status (0-1 vs. 2), prior platinum 
therapy (refractory vs. received), prior paclitaxel therapy (refractory vs. received vs. none), 
prior regimens (1 vs. 2), smoking history (ever vs. never), and center.  Patients will be 
identified to the Centralized Registration/ Randomization Center (ClinPhone) using patient 
initials, E-code, and date of birth.  The Centralized Registration/ Randomization Center 
(ClinPhone) will inform the investigator of the patient randomization number and treatment to 
be allocated.  The patient randomisation number will correspond to either ZD1839 or

docetaxel treatment allocation.  Centers will also receive a faxed copy of the completed 
registration details for confirmation. 

Patients may begin study therapy up to 72 hours following the date of randomization (to allow 
for weekends). 

If a patient discontinues from the study, the E-code and randomization number will not be 
reused, and the patient will not be allowed to re-enter the study. 

Blinding and procedures for unblinding the study (not applicable) 
Pre-study, concomitant and post-study treatment(s) 

3.4.3 
3.4.4 
3.4.4.1  Treatment for cancer 
Except for ZD1839 or docetaxel, no systemic treatment or radiotherapy known to have an 
effect on NSCLC may be used while receiving study therapy. 

Exceptions: 

(cid:156)  Patients may receive palliative radiotherapy at the site of bony metastases that were 

present at baseline, providing the investigator does not feel that the bone pain is 
indicative of clinical disease progression.  If a patient has further bone pain for which a 
second course of palliative radiation therapy is considered, the patient should be 
discussed with the AstraZeneca CST Physician to decide if it is necessary for the 
patient to be discontinued from study therapy. 

(cid:156)  Bisphosphonates may be used for treatment of pain at the site of bony metastases that 
were present at baseline, or for treatment of hypercalcaemia providing the investigator 
does not feel that these are indicative of clinical disease progression. 

(cid:156)  Erythropoietin may be used for the treatment of patients with symptomatic anaemia, in 

line with standard local clinical practice. 

Patients who experience isolated relapse in the central nervous system but whose systemic 
disease is unchanged or improved should be discussed with the AstraZeneca CST physician.  
It may be possible for patients who the investigator considers to be deriving continuing 
clinical benefit to remain on study therapy. 

The need for radiotherapy to any other site should be discussed with the AstraZeneca CST 
Physician, and any decisions made on a case-by-case basis. 

3.4.4.2  Other concomitant treatment 
No concomitant use of the following drugs is allowed: phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, 
barbiturates or St John’s Wort, as these drugs induce CYP3A4 and may decrease levels of 
ZD1839.

Clinical Study Protocol:  Amended 
Study Code 1839IL/0721  
Edition Number 1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors eg, itraconazole, may result in increased levels of 
ZD1839.  This exposure may be clinically relevant since adverse experiences are related to 
dose and exposure. 

Co-administration of drugs that cause significant sustained elevations in gastric pH (cid:152) 5 may 
reduce plasma concentrations of ZD1839 and therefore may reduce efficacy. 

Further elevations of International Normalized Ratio (INR) and/or bleeding events have been 
reported in some patients taking warfarin while on ZD1839.  Patients taking warfarin 
(coumadin) should be monitored regularly for changes in their prothrombin time (PT) or INR. 

There have been no formal clinical studies to evaluate the drug interactions of docetaxel with 
other medications.  In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be 
modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit or are 
metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4, such as cyclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, 
erythromycin and troleandomycin.  Caution should be exercised with these drugs when 
treating patients receiving docetaxel as there is a potential for a significant interaction. 

The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is permitted at the investigator’s 
discretion.  However, routine prophylaxis with these agents is not recommended and may not 
be used instead of protocol prescribed dose reductions for docetaxel myelosupression.  
Erythropoietin may be used according to local institutional guidelines.  The reason(s) for the 
use of either growth factor and dates of treatment should be recorded in the patient’s medical 
records and appropriate section of the CRF. 

Other medication, that is considered necessary for the patient’s safety and well-being, may be 
given at the discretion of the investigator(s).  The administration of all medication (including 
investigational products) must be recorded in the appropriate sections of the CRF. 

In addition, for symptomatic US and Latin American patients only, patient-reported changes 
in the use of PRN bronchodilators, cough suppressant and expectorants, opiates and oxygen, 
will be collected weekly. See section 4.4.1. 

If surgery is considered necessary for the patient, requirements for interruptions to ZD1839 
treatment should first be discussed with the AstraZeneca CST physician on a case-by-case 
basis. 

Palliative thoracic radiotherapy may be administered at the discretion of the Investigator.  It is 
anticipated that the vast majority of patients who require palliative thoracic radiotherapy will 
have disease progression and will, therefore, discontinue study therapy.  If the investigator 
does not feel that this will be in the best interest of a specific patient, then the situation should 
be discussed with the AstraZeneca CST physician and decisions made on a case-by-case basis. 

ZD1839 should be discontinued for at least 3 days prior to initiation of, and during, the 
radiation therapy.  ZD1839 should not be restarted less than 1 week since completion of prior 
radiotherapy, and not until any radiotherapy related toxicity has subsided.

The use of docetaxel in patients requiring palliative thoracic radiotherapy should follow 
standard local clinical practice. 

3.4.4.3  Treatment options post-final data analysis 
Patients will continue on their assigned treatment until the survival results are known for the 
study.  At this time, the long-term treatment for ongoing patients will be assessed and 
determined based on the outcome of the study. 

Treatment compliance 

3.4.5 
Patients will self-administer ZD1839.  In order to demonstrate compliance, patients will be 
required to return any unused drug at dispensing visits. 

Management of Toxicity - ZD1839 

3.5 
In all cases where the patient has discontinued due to unusual or unusually severe toxicity 
considered related to ZD1839, the investigator must contact AstraZeneca (see Medical 
Emergency Procedure page 2 of this protocol). 

ZD1839 dose interruption/reduction 

3.5.1 
Dose interruptions should be used as the first approach to managing toxicity except ILD (see 
section 3.5.6).  Repeat dose interruptions are allowed as required, for a maximum of 14 days 
on each occasion.  If toxicity recurs after drug re-challenge and, if further interruptions are 
considered insufficient to manage the toxicity, withdrawal of the patient may be considered. 

For patients receiving ZD1839, no dose reduction is allowed. 

3.5.2  Management of skin toxicity 
Patients with poorly tolerated skin toxicity may be managed by providing a brief (up to 
14 days) interruption of ZD1839; the daily dose of ZD1839 should then be reinstated.  
However, the rash may improve without the need for interrupting treatment with ZD1839. 

There is no known or established standard treatment proven effective for drug-related skin 
rashes or skin changes due to ZD1839.  Most commonly, a pustular rash has been observed, 
which frequently improves even when the same dose of ZD1839 therapy is continued 
uninterrupted. 

Investigators have had varying degrees of success with a variety of agents used to manage 
skin rashes.  These include mild to moderate strength steroid creams, either topical or 
systemic antihistamines and occasionally retinoid creams.  The need for oral or topical 
antibiotics is a clinical decision of the investigator and should be preceded by a culture of 
affected areas and, if indicated, a dermatology consultation.  Oral retinoids should not be 
given because of theoretical concerns about negatively affecting the ZD1839 mechanism of 
action.

The use of oral steroids for dermatological conditions should be discussed with an AZ CST 
physician.  Dry skin can be managed with simple emollients. 

3.5.3  Management of GI toxicity 
If GI toxicity is not appropriately managed, this may be associated with the development of 
dehydration.  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice promptly in the event of 
developing severe or persistent diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or anorexia. 

3.5.3.1  Nausea and/or vomiting 
In patients who have emesis and are unable to retain ZD1839, every attempt should be made 
to control the nausea and vomiting.  The dose of ZD1839 may be repeated if emesis occurs 
within 30 minutes of taking the tablet. 

3.5.3.2  Diarrhea 
Diarrhea has been successfully managed with anti-diarrheal agents such as loperamide. 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

CTC grade 1-2 diarrhea.  No specific supportive care is usually needed or 
indicated.  Oral fluid intake should be encouraged 

CTC grade 3 or 4 diarrhea.  If this occurs immediate supportive care measures 
should be instigated and ZD1839 should be interrupted for up to a maximum of 
14 days until resolution, or the diarrhea has decreased in severity to CTC grade 1.  
If CTC grade 3 or 4 diarrhea recurs, and in the investigators opinion cannot be 
controlled by further drug interruptions and optimal symptomatic management, then 
ZD1839 should be discontinued 

If a grade 4 diarrhea is associated with hemodynamic collapse, the investigator 
should notify the AstraZeneca CST physician to discuss the patient’s further 
participation in the study, and report as an SAE 

3.5.4  Management of elevated transaminases 
Asymptomatic increases in liver transaminases have been observed in patients receiving 
ZD1839.  ZD1839 should be used cautiously in the presence of mild to moderate increases of 
liver transaminases.  Discontinuation should be considered if changes are severe. 

3.5.5  Management of ocular toxicity 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice promptly in the event of developing any eye 
symptoms. 

3.5.6  Management of Interstitial Lung Disease 
ILD, including interstitial pneumonitis, is a common complication of lung diseases including 
advanced lung cancer, regardless of treatment.  It has been widely observed in clinical studies 
in which chemotherapy (incidence generally ranges from 3% to 6%) and/or radiotherapy

(incidence generally ranges from 10% to 15%) has been used for the treatment of advanced 
lung cancer. 

ILD, which may be acute in onset, has been observed uncommonly in patients treated with 
ZD1839.  These patients usually present with a fairly acute onset of dyspnea sometimes 
associated with cough or low-grade fever.  This may become quite severe within a short 
period of time and usually results in hospitalization.  Radiological investigations, often 
including CT scan, frequently show pulmonary infiltrates or interstitial shadowing with 
ground glass appearance.  There is often respiratory distress with arterial oxygen desaturation.  
Cultures are frequently negative for bacterial growth.  In a number of cases, the event has 
responded to steroid therapy but this is not always so and some cases have been fatal.  Patients 
with concurrent idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia, pneumoconiosis, 
radiation pneumonia or drug-induced pneumonia have been observed to have an increased 
mortality rate from this condition. 

If patients present with an acute worsening or new onset of respiratory symptoms such as 
dyspnea, cough and fever, ZD1839 should be interrupted and the patient promptly 
investigated for ILD.  If ILD is confirmed, and is believed to be ZD1839-related, ZD1839 
should be permanently discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. 

3.5.6.1  Guidelines for the assessment of patients developing new onset or worsening of 

respiratory symptoms 

If, during the course of the study, a patient develops new onset, or worsening of existing 
respiratory symptoms then ZD1839 should be temporarily interrupted and investigations 
undertaken to define the aetiology of these symptoms. 

Clinical investigation (radiological studies and pulmonary function studies) should be strongly 
considered.  It is anticipated that these investigations would include at least a chest X-ray and 
repeat spirometry.  Specialist pulmonary consultation should also be considered.  Further 
clinical management will be dictated by the results of these investigations and the clinical 
condition of the patient. 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

Clinical presentation and investigations indicate a diagnosis other than ILD:  
Patients should receive appropriate therapy, which will vary according to the 
specific diagnosis made (eg, intercurrent infection, progressive disease, pulmonary 
edema, pulmonary embolus).  Depending on the clinical situation, ZD1839 may or 
may not need to be discontinued.  This will be at the discretion of the investigator 
but if there is any uncertainty, the investigator should contact the AstraZeneca CST 
physician. 

Clinical presentation and investigations indicate/suggest a diagnosis of ILD: 
ZD1839 should be discontinued and an attempt should be made to define the extent 
of and a specific etiology for the ILD (eg, radiation pneumonitis, viral or fungal 
infections, pulmonary fibrosis).  This is likely to require high resolution CT 
scanning (HRCT) and full pulmonary function testing, with measurement of

transfer factor.  Additional investigations such as bronchoalveolar lavage, 
trans-bronchial biopsy or video assisted trans-thoracic biopsy should also be 
undertaken if clinically appropriate.  Specialist pulmonary consultation is 
strongly recommended. 

The patient should receive all therapeutic and supportive intervention deemed 
appropriate by the investigator.  The use of corticosteroids should be considered. 

The investigator should contact AstraZeneca within 24 hours to report the ILD as a 
SAE.  Further information will subsequently be collected by AstraZeneca in the 
form of a detailed questionnaire.  This will allow for prospective data collection to 
evaluate the incidence, duration, severity and reversibility of episodes of ILD. 

Clinical presentation and investigations inconclusive:  In this situation, the 
continued administration of ZD1839 should be at the discretion of the investigator.  
However, if there is any uncertainty regarding the continuation of study medication, 
the investigator should contact the AstraZeneca CST physician. 

The patient should be closely monitored for further changes in respiratory 
symptoms, which may indicate the need for additional or repeat investigations 
and/or specialist pulmonary consultation. 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

If additional or repeat investigations indicate/suggest a diagnosis of ILD, the patient should be 
managed as described above. 

Other toxicity 

3.5.7 
For any other CTC grade 3 or 4 toxicity or any clinically significant lower grade toxicity, 
treatment with ZD1839 should be interrupted for a maximum of 14 days until the patient 
recovers completely or the toxicity reverts to CTC grade 1 or to baseline grade. 

In all cases where a patient has been withdrawn due to unusual or unusually severe toxicity 
considered related to ZD1839, the investigator must contact the AstraZeneca CST physician. 

Docetaxel adverse events, dose reduction and treatment delays 

3.6 
Dose-limiting toxicities for docetaxel include myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, and 
severe neuropathies.  The most frequent toxicity is neutropenia which is reported at Grade 3 or 
4 in 65% of patients treated at a dose of 75 mg/m2.  Neutropenia is typically of early onset, 
with nadirs at around 7 days, but recovers by Day 21 in nearly all patients.  At a dose of 
75 mg/m2, febrile neutropenia is reported in 6.3% of patients but thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 
or 4 anemia are rarely reported.  Less than 6% of patients report Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal 
or neurological toxicity.  Severe skin reactions are uncommon but alopecia is reported in at 
least half of all patients.  Fluid retention occurs with greater frequency with cumulative doses 
above 400 mg/m2 and is the dose-limiting toxicity with cumulative doses.  The 
pathophysiology of fluid retention has not been fully defined but is thought to be related to 
cytokine release and microvascular changes.  A marked reduction in the time to onset and

severity of fluid retention can be achieved with the use of oral steroids 24 hours prior to and 
continuing for 48 hours after the administration of docetaxel. 

General rules 

3.6.1 
Every effort should be made to administer the full dose regimen to maximise dose-intensity, 
and to manage possible drug-related toxicity for the sake of the patient so that they may be 
able to benefit from therapy and remain evaluable for one or more efficacy end-points. 

Toxicities should be managed symptomatically.  If toxicity occurs, the appropriate treatment 
will be used to ameliorate signs and symptoms including anti-emetics for nausea and 
vomiting, anti-diarrheals for diarrhea, and antipyretics and antihistamines for drug fever. 

If a patient experiences several toxicities and there are conflicting recommendations, the most 
conservative dose adjustment will be adopted. 

Treatment may be delayed by a maximum of 21 days to allow recovery from acute toxicity.  If 
treatment delay longer than 21 days is required, the patient should be withdrawn from further 
docetaxel treatment. 

A treatment delay (cid:152) 3 days should be justified in the CRF. 

No re-escalation of the dose is permitted once dose reduction has taken place as a result of any 
toxicity.  Following dose reduction to 60 mg/m2 , further toxicity that would necessitate dose 
reduction should lead to discontinuation of docetaxel, with the exception of neutropenia (see 
Table 4). 

Hematological toxicity 

3.6.2 
Docetaxel may cause myelosuppression at the dose levels infused during this study.   

Before the start of any cycle of docetaxel, the following hematologic criteria must be met: 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

ANC (cid:152) 1.5 x 109/L 

Platelets (cid:152) 100 x 109/L 

Docetaxel may be withheld for up to 21 days to allow recovery of myelosuppression.  If 
haematologic recovery has not occurred within 21 days, docetaxel therapy should be 
discontinued. 

The dose of docetaxel to be administered at a given cycle will depend upon the haematologic 
nadir from the preceding cycle. 

(cid:156) 

Neutropenia - Patients with afebrile, grade 4 neutropenia (cid:152)7 days or grade 3 to 4 
neutropenia associated with fever (one reading of oral temperature > 38.5° C, or 
three readings of oral temperature > 38.0° C in a 24-hour period) should have their 
dosage for subsequent cycles reduced as shown in Table 4.

Thrombocytopenia – Patients experiencing grade 4 thrombocytopenia should have 
their dosage for subsequent cycles reduced to 60 mg/m2.  A further episode of

Docetaxel should not be administered to any patients with serum total bilirubin >ULRR.  If 
serum total bilirubin is > ULRR on treatment day, hold docetaxel until serum total bilirubin is 
(cid:136) ULRR (maximum 21 days), and then re-treat at a reduced dose (60 mg/m2).  If serum total 
bilirubin has not returned to < ULRR within 21 days, docetaxel therapy should be

Nausea/vomiting 

3.6.4 
Anti-emetic treatment should be administered to patients from the first cycle and the 
prophylactic use of a 5HT3 antagonist is recommended. 

If, despite appropriate medication, grade (cid:152) 3 nausea/vomiting still occurs, the dose of 
docetaxel should be reduced to 60 mg/m2.  If despite dose reduction, nausea/vomiting still 
occurs at grade (cid:152) 3, the patient should be withdrawn from further study treatment. 

Diarrhea  

3.6.5 
No prophylactic treatment for diarrhea is recommended for cycle 1.  However, following the 
first episode of diarrhea, the patient should receive symptomatic treatment with loperamide: 
4 mg following the first episode, then 2 mg following each new episode until recovery of 
diarrhea (no more than 16 mg daily). 

If, despite the use of loperamide, grade (cid:152) 3 diarrhea still occurs, the dose of docetaxel should 
be reduced to 60 mg/m2.  If, despite dose reduction, diarrhea still occurs at grade (cid:152) 3, the 
patient should be withdrawn from further study treatment. 

Neuropathies 

3.6.6 
For peripheral neuropathy, the docetaxel dose should be reduced to 60 mg/m2 without 
treatment delay for Grade 2 motor or sensory neuropathies.  Treatment should be discontinued 
for Grade 3/4 neuropathies. 

Skin toxicity 

3.6.7 
For skin toxicities of CTC Grades 0 to 2 no dose modifications are necessary. 

For Grade 3 toxicities treatment should be delayed until (cid:136) Grade 1 for a maximum of 21 days 
and the dose of docetaxel then reduced to 60 mg/m2.  If there is no recovery to (cid:136) Grade 1 
within the 21 days delay treatment should be discontinued. 

Docetaxel-induced fluid retention 

3.6.8 
No dose reduction is planned for fluid retention (peripheral oedema and/or effusions) 
occurring during the treatment with docetaxel. 

The patient’s body weight will be recorded and followed as frequently as possible to 
document any weight gain that could be related to oedema. 

Recommended Treatment 
Treatment should commence when signs and/or symptoms of fluid retention are observed, 
including weight gain from baseline (cid:152) grade 1 not otherwise explained. 

Based on the hypothesis of capillary damage due to docetaxel, the following treatment is 
recommended if fluid retention occurs: furosemide 20 mg orally once daily.

Clinical Study Protocol:  Amended 
Study Code 1839IL/0721  
Edition Number 1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

If the symptoms cannot be controlled adequately ie, worsening of the fluid retention or 
spread to another area, the dose of furosemide should be increased to 40 mg.  The addition of 
oral metolazone at the recommended dose together with potassium with or without 
magnesium supplements may be useful. 

The clinical tolerance of the patient, the overall tumor response and the medical judgement 
of the investigator will determine if it is in the patient’s best interest to continue or to 
discontinue docetaxel.  It is recommended however, that patients with fluid retention of 
grade (cid:152) 3 severity should be withdrawn from further chemotherapy. 

If it is difficult to make a judgement as to whether an effusion is disease-related or 
docetaxel-related, the treatment should be continued, provided there is no worsening of the 
effusion during treatment. 

Hypersensitivity Reactions 

3.6.9 
Treatment should be discontinued for Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions.  There are no dose 
reductions for hypersensitivity reactions 

Anaphylactic-like reactions may occur during or following the docetaxel infusion.  Facial 
edema, bronchoconstriction, tachycardia and hypotension may occur within minutes of 
docetaxel administration.  As a routine precaution, resuscitation equipment and other agents 
(eg, epinephrine, prednisone equivalents etc.) should be available during and following the 
infusion.

At a minimum, re-assessment of grade 3 or 4 toxicity should be performed twice weekly and 
more frequently if clinically indicated.  Reinstitution of docetaxel therapy should be guided by 
the dose modification schedule described above.

4.3.1 

Quality of Life (QoL) - Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Lung 
(FACT-L) 

4.3.1.1  Methods of assessment 
Data on PROs and QoL will be assessed by using the FACT-L.  FACT-L has been validated 
with respect to its psychometric properties and sensitivity to clinical changes (Cella et al 1993, 
1995 and 2002).  This questionnaire has been used in many clinical studies in patients with 
advanced lung cancer, including previous AstraZeneca studies, and is appropriate, valid and 
sensitive to clinical changes in this study population. 

4.3.1.2  Derivation of outcome variables 
The following subscale scores will be derived from the FACT-L questionnaire: 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

FACT-L total score – the sum of physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being 
(FWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and LCS 
domains 

Trial Outcome Index (TOI) which is the sum of the PWB, FWB and LCS domain 
scores 

Pulmonary symptom improvement score 

If less than 50% of the subscale items are missing, the subscale score will be divided by the 
number of non-missing items and multiplied by the total number of items on the subscale.  If 
50% or more of the items are missing, that subscale will be treated as missing.  The reason for 
any missing data will be identified.  If data is missing at random, the above techniques will be 
used.  If there is evidence that the missing data is systematic, missing values will be handled 
to ensure that any possible bias is minimized. 

Administration of PRO questionnaires 

4.3.2 
Paper questionnaires will be utilized for collection of all PROs.  Patients will complete 
questionnaires either at home (for the weekly LCS) or at a scheduled clinic visit (for the 
3-weekly FACT-L).  Each center must allocate responsibility for monitoring compliance with 
completion of questionnaires to a specific individual (eg, a Research Nurse).  The 
AstraZeneca Clinical Team will provide relevant training for patient education, monitoring 
and administration of the paper questionnaires.  It is also important that the significance and 
relevance of the data are explained carefully to participating patients so that they are 
motivated to comply with data collection (Fallowfield et al 1987).  Questionnaires will only be 
monitored for completion/compliance, not for answers. 

The instructions for completion of the FACT-L are:

associated 95% confidence interval (CI). 

Time to progression 

4.6.2 
4.6.2.1  Method of assessment 
TTP will be assessed from the overall tumor evaluation at each tumor assessment per RECIST 
criteria (see Appendix C) and investigator clinical judgement and/or the date of patient death. 

4.6.2.2  Derivation of outcome variables  
Time to progression is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the 
earlier date of objective disease progression per RECIST criteria or death due to any cause in 
the absence of progression.  Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis 
will be censored at the time of their latest objective tumor assessment.  This includes patients 
lost to follow-up or who have withdrawn consent.  The TTP for patients without post-baseline 
tumor assessment is defined as zero days. 

The progression-free rates and their standard errors at 4 months and 6 months will be 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and Greenwood’s formula. 

The following conventions will be applied in the derivation of overall time to progression: 

(cid:156) 

Patients with global deterioration alone without objective radiologic progression 
will be considered to have progressive disease categorized as “symptomatic 
progression”.  In such cases, tumor assessments will be continued to document 
objective progression.  If evidence of objective radiologic progression is obtained

(cid:156) 

prior to subsequent anti-cancer therapy, and within 6 weeks from the last scheduled 
tumor assessment, then the date of progression will be revised to the date of 
objective radiologic progression.  If death in the absence of objective radiologic 
progression occurs within 6 weeks of the last scheduled assessment, regardless of 
subsequent therapy, then the date of progression will be revised to the date of death.  
Otherwise the date of progression will be the date of symptomatic progression. 

For patients who withdraw from therapy without evidence of disease progression 
(symptomatic or radiologic), tumor assessments will be continued to document 
objective progression.  If evidence of objective radiologic progression is obtained 
prior to subsequent anti-cancer therapy and within 6 weeks from the last scheduled 
tumor assessment, then the patient will be considered to have objective progression 
on the date of radiologic progression.  If death in the absence of objective radiologic 
progression occurs within 6 weeks of the last scheduled assessment, regardless of 
subsequent therapy, then the patient will be considered to have objective 
progression on the date of death.  Otherwise, the patient will be censored for 
progression at the last full tumor assessment. 

Pulmonary symptom improvement 

4.6.3 
4.6.3.1  Methods of assessment 
Improvement in pulmonary symptoms will be assessed from the four pulmonary specific 
items of the LCS portion of the FACT-L (short of breath, ease of breathing, tightness in chest 
and cough). 

This outcome variable will only be measured in the symptomatic US and Latin American 
patient population.  Patients will be considered symptomatic if they have at least one of the 
following FACT-L pulmonary items at baseline that scores either Very much or Quite a bit  

 

I have been short of breath 

I have been coughing 

I feel tightness in my chest 

 

OR 

Patients will be considered symptomatic if they score Not at all or A little bit on the 
following FACT-L pulmonary items at baseline:  

Breathing is easy for me

Study Code 1839IL/0721  
Edition Number 1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

4.6.3.2  Derivation of outcome variable 
Pulmonary symptom improvement is defined as an improvement from baseline in at least 1 
moderate (score 1) or severe (score 0) pulmonary item of the FACT-L LCS of at least 2 points 
that is maintained for at least 28 days ie, improvement from moderate (score 1) to minimal 
(score 3) or none (score 4), or improvement from severe (score 0) to mild (score 2), minimal 
(score 3), or none (score 4). 

During an interval of item improvement, the overall pulmonary symptom score (sum of all 4 
LCS pulmonary items) must be at least 2 points above baseline, and all pulmonary item scores 
can be no more than 1 point below baseline. 

To allow tolerance for missed assessments, no more than 1 scheduled assessment (LCS 
weekly or FACT-L every 3 weeks) in an interval of item improvement can be missing. 

Pulmonary symptom improvement must be demonstrated in the absence of significant 
increases in the use of concomitant medications that itself could have resulted in 
improvement, as assessed by the investigator. 

The overall pulmonary symptom improvement rate will be calculated as the percentage of 
patients analyzed with improvement. 

Objective tumor response  

4.6.4 
4.6.4.1  Methods of assessment 
The RECIST criteria will be used by the investigator to assess objective tumor response.  
Post-baseline tumor evaluations should use the same modality (CT, MRI etc.) as at baseline 
and should preferably be undertaken at the same institution.  Target and non-target lesions 
should be selected from the baseline scan and documented on the RECIST modules prior to 
performing the first follow-up scan. 

Upon discontinuation of the patient or study closure, the investigator should assign an overall 
best response for the patient based on the definitions given per RECIST criteria. 

The overall best tumor response rate will be calculated as the percentage of patients analyzed 
with CR or PR with or without confirmation with imaging at least 28 days following the initial 
date of response. 

Time to and duration of objective tumor response 

4.6.5 
4.6.5.1  Methods of assessment 
Time to and duration of objective tumor response will be assessed from the overall tumor 
evaluation at each tumor assessment per RECIST criteria and investigator clinical judgment.  
These variables apply only to patients with an overall objective response of CR or PR.

4.6.5.2  Derivation of outcome variable 
Time to objective tumor response is defined as the interval between the date of randomization 
and the first documented response of CR or PR.  Duration of objective tumor response is 
defined as the interval between the date of first documented response of CR or PR and the 
earlier date of objective disease progression per RECIST criteria or death due to any cause in 
the absence of progression.  Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis 
will be censored at the date of their last objective tumor assessment. 

Note:  The conventions for TTP will be applied for duration of objective response. 

Improvement in patient-reported functionality (PRF) 

4.6.6 
4.6.6.1  Methods of assessment 
Improvement in PRF will be assessed from the TOI, which is the sum of the PWB, FWB and 
LCS domains of the FACT-L (see Appendix D). 

4.6.6.2  Derivation of outcome variable 
Overall improvement in PRF is defined as an improvement from baseline in the TOI of 
6 points or more sustained for at least 21 days.  To allow tolerance for missed assessments, no 
more than one FACT-L assessment in this interval can be missing. 

The overall PRF improvement rate will be calculated as the percentage of patients analyzed 
with improvement. 

Improvement in quality of life (QoL) 

4.6.7 
4.6.7.1  Methods of assessment 
Improvement in QoL will be assessed from the FACT-L total score. 

4.6.7.2  Derivation of outcome variable 
Overall improvement in QoL is defined as an improvement from baseline in the FACT-L total 
score of 6 points or more sustained for at least 21 days.  To allow tolerance for missed 
assessments, no more than one FACT-L assessment in this interval can be missing. 

Correlation between spirometry and pulmonary symptoms 

4.6.8 
4.6.8.1  Methods of assessment 
Evaluation of spirometry will occur at two screening measurements and at Day 43 (visit 4) 
after initiation of study therapy. 

4.6.8.2  Calculation or derivation of outcome variable 
Spirometry results will be evaluated in relation to selected PROs and clinical outcomes.

Patient-reported perceptions of treatment side effects 

4.6.9 
4.6.9.1  Methods of assessment 
Patient-reported perception of treatment side effects will be measured by question GP5 of the 
FACT-L PWB domain:  “I am bothered by side effects of treatment”. 

4.6.9.2  Derivation of outcome variable 
Question GP5 will be scored per the FACT-L scoring algorithm from the patient’s answer. 

4.6.10  Changes in pain and fatigue 
4.6.10.1  Methods of assessment 
Pain and fatigue, which are symptoms commonly associated with advancing cancer, will be 
included in weekly assessments.  Two questions (GP1 (Fatigue) and GP4 (Pain)) from the 
FACT-L PWB domain will be used for this assessment. 

This outcome variable will only be measured in the symptomatic US and Latin American 
patient population. 

4.6.10.2  Derivation of outcome variable 
These two questions will be scored per the FACT-L scoring algorithm from the patient’s 
answer. 

Patient global assessment of change in pulmonary symptoms 

4.6.11 
4.6.11.1  Methods of assessment 
Patient global assessment of change in pulmonary symptoms will be explored through the use 
of the following question, which will be collected weekly up to 6 weeks: 

(cid:156) 

“Compared to the way you felt before you took your first dose of study medication 
on this study, would you say the way you generally feel about your lung symptoms 
(taking into account shortness of breath, coughing, tightness in the chest and ease of 
breathing) is better, about the same or worse?”. 

This outcome variable will only be measured in the symptomatic US and Latin American 
patient population. 

4.6.11.2  Derivation of outcome variable 
The patient assessment of change in pulmonary symptoms will be categorized as ‘better, 
about the same, or worse’. 

EGFR and other related biomarker status

performed at a central laboratory: analysis of total and/or activated EGFR and other ErbB 
family receptors, related signal transduction, proliferation and apoptosis markers, mutation 
status for the EGFR gene and for genes of associated pathways, serum cytokine levels, plasma 
and urine proteomic profiles and metabonomic profiles.  Additional information will be 
provided for preparation and shipment of these specimens.  For tumor tissue samples, 
paraffin-embedded blocks are preferred.  However, re-cut sections or slides from diagnosis 
and later will also be accepted. 

In addition, proteomic and metabonomic profiling methodologies to identify new markers 
which may be of predictive value in targeting appropriate patient populations, or evaluating 
basic biological mechanisms will also be undertaken.  Details are given in Appendix E. 

Since this is a complex area of investigation, which is rapidly evolving and as yet not 
completely understood, data obtained in this study will not be definitive but potentially can be 
used in hypothesis generation. 

All costs related to the procurement of tissue or slides will be reimbursed by AstraZeneca.  
Any data obtained from analysis of tumor tissue, urine or plasma samples will be used for 
basic science research only, and patient confidentiality will be preserved internally and in any 
presentations or publications.  The samples will be available to scientists either within 
AstraZeneca or at laboratories/research institutes contracted to AstraZeneca and patient 
confidentiality will be preserved.  Initials and E-codes will be used on all documents brought 
into AstraZeneca and date of birth will be used as an additional identifier.  A master list is 
retained at each center linking initials to patient E-code. 

Samples will be retained for 10 years and data for 15 years in line with AstraZeneca’s current 
policy. 

4.6.12.2  Derivation of outcome variable 
Where consent has been obtained, and in patients where appropriate biological samples are 
available (tumor tissue, and/or plasma/serum and/or urine samples), the following will be 
assessed: tumor EGFR and other related biomarkers to investigate qualitative and quantitative 
aspects of signal transduction pathways and mutation status for the EGFR gene and for genes 
of associated pathways.  Measurement of biomarkers in serum, plasma and urine - including 
plasma and urine proteomics, serum cytokines and metabonomics - at baseline and during 
therapy will also be assessed. 

See Appendices E and H for details on processing and evaluation of samples.

Adverse events 

4.7.1 
4.7.1.1  Definitions 
The definitions of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and other significant 
adverse events (OAEs) are given below.  It is of the utmost importance that all staff involved 
in the study are familiar with the content of this section.  The principal investigator is 
responsible for ensuring this. 

Adverse event 
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a 
pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), or signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical 
studies from the time of signing informed consent, an AE can include an undesirable medical 
condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study 
treatment has been administered. 

(a) 

Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be 
reported as an AE. 

Serious adverse event 
A SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), 
and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or more 
of the following criteria: 

(cid:156)

Results in death 

Is immediately life-threatening 

Requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation 

Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 

Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 

Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 

Any events or hospitalisation that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be 
reported as a SAE. 

The causality of SAEs (ie, their relationship to study treatment) will be assessed by the 
investigator(s), who in completing the relevant case report form must answer “yes” or “no” to 
the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have

been caused by the drug?”  For further guidance on the definition of a SAE and a guide to the 
interpretation of the causality question, see Appendix B to the Clinical Study Protocol. 

Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be reported as 
an SAE. 

Other significant adverse event (OAE) 
OAEs will be identified by the Drug Safety Physician and if applicable also by the CST 
Physician during the evaluation of safety data for the Clinical Study Report.  Significant AEs 
of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to discontinuation of 
the patient from study treatment, will be classified as OAEs.  Examples of these are marked 
hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain events that lead to intervention 
(other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction or significant additional 
treatment.  For each OAE, a narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study 
Report. 

4.7.1.2  Recording of adverse events 
(i) 

Method for detecting AE/SAE 

At each visit the method of detecting AE and SAEs in this study will be by:  

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

(cid:156) 

Information volunteered by the patient, or caregiver 

Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient at every visit such as 
the following: How are you feeling?  Have you had any (other) medical problems 
since your last visit 

Observation by the investigational team, other care providers or relatives 

(ii) 

Time period for collection of AE/SAEs  

Non serious AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time consent is given, throughout the 
treatment period and up to and including the 30 day follow-up period. 

(iii) 

Collection of AE data 

All AEs will be recorded on the CRFs provided.  A description of the event, including its date 
of onset and resolution, whether it constitutes a SAE or not, any action taken (eg, changes to 
study treatment, other treatment given, and follow-up tests) and outcome, should be provided 
along with the investigator’s assessment of causality (the relationship to the study 
treatment[s]).  AEs will also be graded according to the National Cancer Institute common 
toxicity criteria Version 2.0 (NCI CTC), and changes tracked on the relevant CRF.

(iv) 

Causality 

For an AE to be a suspected drug-related event, there should be at least a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship between the study medicinal product and the AE (see 
Appendix B for guidelines on interpretation of causality and bullet points below). 

(cid:156)

Time course – temporal relationship to receiving drug 

Consistency with known drug profile 

De-challenge experience – AE resolves after stopping drug 

No alternative cause – AE cannot be explained by aetiology, underlying disease, 
etc. 

Re-challenge experience – AE reoccurs when drug reintroduced 

Laboratory tests 

(v) 

Study participation events 

In addition to making a causality assessment with respect to the study treatment, the 
investigator should also consider whether study participation (ie, protocol mandated 
procedures such as invasive tests, change to existing therapy) contributed to the occurrence of 
the event. SAEs considered to be related to study participation, should be reported in the usual 
SAE timeframes to AstraZeneca Drug Safety whether they occur pre, during or post the study 
treatment period. 

(vi) 

Intensity 

It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 4.7.1.1.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke 
that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be 
an SAE. 

(vii) 

Disease progression 

Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be reported as an 
AE. 
(viii) 

Lack of efficacy 

When there is deterioration in the condition for which the study treatment is being used (ie, 
NSCLC), there may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such 
cases, unless AstraZeneca or the reporting physician considers that the study treatment

Clinical Study Protocol:  Amended 
Study Code 1839IL/0721  
Edition Number 1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

contributed to the deterioration, or local regulations state to the contrary, the deterioration 
should be considered to be a lack of efficacy and not an AE.  
(ix) 

Deaths 

All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol defined follow-up period after 
the administration of the last dose of study treatment, must be reported as follows: 

Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported to the study monitor at the 
next monitoring visit and should be documented in the CRF but should not be reported as a 
SAE. 

Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of disease under study, the AE 
causing the death must be reported to the study monitor as a SAE within 24 hours.  The report 
should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of disease, if 
appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death.  

Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.  A post mortem maybe 
helpful in the assessment of the cause of death and, if performed, a copy of the post-mortem 
results should be forwarded to AstraZeneca Drug Safety within the usual timeframes. 

(x) 

New Cancers 

The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet at 
least one of the serious criteria.  New cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the 
administration of the study treatment and have been identified after the inclusion of the patient 
into the study.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  Symptoms of 
metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE as they are considered 
to be disease progression. 
(xi) 

Abnormal laboratory findings/vital signs 

The reporting of laboratory /vital signs abnormalities as both laboratory findings and adverse 
events should be avoided.  They should not be reported as an AE unless any criterion for a 
SAE is fulfilled, the laboratory /vital signs abnormalities causes the patient to discontinue 
from the study, or the investigator insists the abnormality should be reported as an AE.  If an 
abnormal laboratory value /vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the 
sign/symptom should be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant CRF. 
See Section 3.3.5.2 (Procedures for discontinuation) for recording of laboratory values at time 
of discontinuation. 
(xii) 

Pregnancy 

Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported in accordance with the procedures described in 
section 9.4 (Procedures in case of pregnancy).  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE

unless there is a suspicion that an investigational product may have interfered with the 
effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 

(xiii) 

Follow up of AEs/SAEs 

After the initial AE/SAE report the investigator is required to follow up proactively each 
patient and provide further information to AstraZeneca on the patient’s condition.  During the 
study, all AE/SAEs should be followed up to resolution or until the condition stabilises, unless 
the event is considered by the investigator to be unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s 
underlying disease, or the patient is lost to follow-up. 

(xiv) 

Handling unresolved AE/SAEs at completion/discontinuation 

All study-related toxicities and SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless, in the 
investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying 
disease. 

AstraZeneca reserves the right to ask for further information on any AE which may be 
considered of interest. 

4.7.1.3  Reporting of serious adverse events 
Investigators and other site personnel must inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives of 
any SAE that occurs in the course of the study within 1 day (ie, immediately but no later than 
the end of the next business day) of when he or she becomes aware of it. 

The AstraZeneca representative will work with the investigator to compile all the necessary 
information and ensure that the AstraZeneca Drug Safety Department (ie, Clintrace Data 
Entry Site) receives a report within 1 day for all fatal and life-threatening cases and by day 5 
for all other SAEs. 

Follow-up information on SAEs must also be reported by the investigator within the same 
time frames. 

If a non-serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow-up information must also 
be provided to AstraZeneca within 1 day as described above. 

All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product.  All SAEs will be recorded in the case report form.  The investigator is responsible 
for informing the Ethics Committee and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local 
requirements.

For serum cytokine samples, a single venous blood sample (10 ml) will be collected for each 
patient at baseline prior to first dose of study medication, then again at each tumor assessment 
(days 43, 85, 127 etc.) and finally after withdrawal of study therapy.  These samples should 
also be taken prior to the patient receiving any study medication on that day. 

Please refer to Appendices E and H for details on collection and processing of samples for 
biomarker and serum cytokine analysis.

Method of statistical analysis 
Primary Efficacy Variable 

6.4 
6.4.1 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival between ZD1839 and 
docetaxel.  The goal is to demonstrate non-inferior or superior survival for ZD1839 compared 
with docetaxel. 

The null hypothesis to be tested is that ZD1839 retains less than 50% of the active-control 
effect on survival [log hazard ratio scale].  The relative difference between the treatment arms 
will be analysed by estimating a hazard ratio (ZD1839 to docetaxel) and its 95% CI from an 
unadjusted proportional hazards model in the PP population.  The null hypothesis will be 
rejected if the upper 95% CI limit for the log HR is less than k, where k is a constant 
(dependent on the number of observed events, the active-control effect size and its standard 
error) given by equation (10) in Rothmann et al 2003. 

If the null hypothesis of survival inferiority is rejected, then superior survival for ZD1839 will 
be declared relative to docetaxel if the lower 95% CI is above 1.0 (estimated in the ITT 
population) (closed test procedure per Morikawa & Yoshida 1995). 

Kaplan-Meier plots will be produced for overall survival (Kaplan and Meier 1958).

Nonparametric 95% CIs will be calculated for the median event times and their difference 
(Brookmeyer& Crowley 1982, Su & Wei 1993). 

Secondary efficacy variables 

6.4.2 
6.4.2.1  Time to progression 
The primary statistical analysis for TTP will be in the evaluable for response population.  This 
variable will also be analyzed in the ITT population to assess population sensitivity. 

For TTP, the relative difference between the treatment arms will be analyzed by estimating a 
hazard ratio and its 95% CI for ZD1839 to docetaxel from a proportional hazards model.  The 
model will allow for the effect of treatment and include covariates for histology 
(adenocarcinoma vs. other), performance status (0-1 vs. 2), prior platinum therapy (refractory 
vs. received), smoking history (ever vs. never), prior paclitaxel therapy (refractory vs. 
received vs. none), prior regimens (1 vs. 2), sex and race (Asian vs. other). 

Kaplan-Meier plots will be produced for TTP (Kaplan and Meier 1958). 

Nonparametric 95% CIs will be calculated for the median event times and their difference 
(Brookmeyer & Crowley 1982, Su & Wei 1993). 

6.4.2.2  Progression-free rates at 4 months and 6 months 
The primary analysis population for progression-free rates at 4 months and 6 months will be 
the evaluable for response population.  This endpoint will also be analyzed in ITT population 
to assess population sensitivity. 

The progression-free rates at 4 months and 6 months and their 95% CIs for each treatment arm 
and their difference will estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and Greenwood’s formula, 
and a z test will be used to test for a treatment difference. 

6.4.2.3  Objective tumor response rate 
The primary analysis population for objective tumor response rate will be the evaluable for 
response population.  This endpoint will also be analyzed in the ITT population to assess 
population sensitivity. 

Improvement in patient-reported functionality (PRF) 

The objective response rate will be analyzed as per the pulmonary symptom improvement rate 
(see section 6.4.3.2). 
6.4.2.4 
The primary analysis population for improvement in PRF will be the evaluable for QoL 
improvement population.  To assess population sensitivity, comparisons will also be made in 
the ITT and PP populations. 
The proportion of patients showing improvement in PRF as measured by the TOI of FACT-L 
will be analyzed as per the pulmonary symptom improvement rate (see section 6.4.3.2).

Improvement in quality of life (QoL) 

6.4.2.5 
The primary analysis population for improvement in QoL will be the evaluable for QoL 
population.  To assess population sensitivity, comparisons will also be made in the ITT and PP 
populations. 
The proportion of patients showing improvement in QoL as measured by the FACT-L total 
score will be analyzed as per the pulmonary symptom improvement rate (see section 6.4.3.2). 
6.4.2.6  Assessment of safety profiles 
All patients who receive ZD1839/docetaxel will be included in the assessment of safety 
profiles (evaluable for safety population).  Safety profiles will be assessed in terms of AEs and 
laboratory data/vital signs that will be collected for all patients.  At the end of the study, 
appropriate summaries of laboratory data/vital signs and AEs will be produced and compared 
across the two treatment arms. 

Exploratory variables 

6.4.3 
6.4.3.1  EGFR and other related biomarker status 
Appropriate statistical methods will be used to explore the correlation between tumor 
biomarkers and clinical outcomes. 

6.4.3.2  Pulmonary symptom changes 
The primary analysis population for pulmonary symptom changes will be the evaluable for 
pulmonary symptom improvement population. 
The treatment difference in the pulmonary symptom improvement rate will be analyzed using 
a multivariate logistic regression model.  The model will allow for the effect of treatment and 
will include the covariates for histology (adenocarcinoma vs. other), performance status (0-1 
vs. 2), prior platinum therapy (refractory vs. received), smoking history (ever vs. never), prior 
therapy with paclitaxel (refractory vs. received vs. none), prior regimens (1 vs. 2), sex and 
race (Asian vs. other).  The odds ratio for treatment (ZD1839 to docetaxel) will be estimated 
from the model along with its associated 95% CI.  The improvement rate will be estimated for 
each treatment arm and an associated exact 95% CI will be calculated for each arm as well as 
for the difference between rates using the Newcombe-Wilson score method (uncorrected). 

The primary analysis population for pulmonary score group changes will be the evaluable for 
QoL population. 

A piece-wise linear growth-curve model will be used to characterize overall and time-specific 
differences in pulmonary scores between treatment arms.  The model development will 
evaluate appropriate assumptions about missing data mechanisms to address the potential for 
bias in estimates of relative treatment differences.  The overall treatment comparison will be 
based on a contrast of the pulmonary score area under concentration-time curve (AUC) for 
each treatment arm over the first 4 months.

The primary analysis population for patient-reported perceptions of treatment side effects will 
be the PP population.  This endpoint will also be analyzed in the evaluable for safety 
population to assess population sensitivity. 

The analysis will be restricted to scores for item GP5 of the FACT-L PWB domain obtained at 
screening (Visit 1), day 22 (Visit 3), and day 43 (Visit 4). 

A repeated measures model will be used to characterize overall and time-specific differences 
in item GP5 scores between treatment arms.  The model development will evaluate 
appropriate assumptions about missing data mechanisms to address the potential for bias in 
estimates of relative treatment differences. 

6.4.3.5  Pain and fatigue 
The primary analysis population for pain and fatigue changes will be the evaluable for QoL 
population in the US only. 

Descriptive measures for changes in pain and fatigue will be provided for each treatment arm.  
Changes will be examined in relation to PROs and selected clinical outcomes.

Various components of medical care resource use will include inpatient hospital stays, 
outpatient visits, emergency room visits, doctor and nurse visits, medication use, procedures, 
radiation therapy, and supplemental oxygen use. 

Determination of sample size 

6.5 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival between ZD1839 and 
docetaxel.  The goal is to demonstrate non-inferior or superior survival for ZD1839 compared 
with docetaxel.

From TAX-317, the median survival for docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is 7.5 months, and for all 
patients randomized to BSC it is 4.6 months (Shepherd et al 2000).  There were approximately 
45 and 77 deaths in the docetaxel and BSC arms, respectively.  From these data, the estimated 
log hazard ratio (active-control effect size) for docetaxel to BSC is approximately 0.49 (-log 
4.6/7.5) with a standard error of 0.18 (2/

45 +

77

). 

The null hypothesis to be tested is that ZD1839 retains less than 50% of the active-control 
effect on survival.  The relative difference between the treatment arms will be analyzed by 
estimating a hazard ratio (ZD1839 to docetaxel) and its 95% CI from an unadjusted 
proportional hazards model in the PP population.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if the 
upper 95% CI limit for the log HR is less than k, where k is a constant (dependent on the 
number of observed events, the active-control effect size and its standard error) given by 
equation (10) in Rothmann et al 2003. 
If the null hypothesis of survival inferiority is rejected, then superior survival for ZD1839 will 
be declared relative to docetaxel if the lower 95% CI is above 1.0 (estimated in the intention-
to-treat population) (closed test procedure per Morikawa & Yoshida 1995). 
The sample size goal is to have at least 85% power to reject the survival inferiority null 
hypothesis at a 2-sided 5% significance level versus the alternative hypothesis that the hazard 
ratio is 0.975.  This will require about 1150 observed patient failure times (Rothmann et al 
2003).  Approximately 1440 patients will be randomized.  Accrual is anticipated to take up to 
18 months with a concave cumulative distribution such that 50% of the target goal would be 
achieved by 12 months (67% total time).  Assuming exponential median survival of 6 months 
and 10% exponential loss to follow-up, sufficient events for the final analysis would be 
expected given a minimum follow-up of about 10 months (Lachin, 1986). 
6.6 
One interim survival analysis is planned to coincide with about 33% of the final survival 
analysis target events (~380 events).  The purpose of this analysis is to detect inferiority 
relating to the overall survival for ZD1839 relative to docetaxel. 
Overall survival will be compared as per the final analysis.  Considerations will be given to 
stop the study early if survival for ZD1839 is inferior to docetaxel at a 2-sided 10% 
significance level ie, the lower 90% CI for the survival hazard ratio (ZD1839:docetaxel) is 
greater than 1.0.  The analysis will have approximately 78% power when the true hazard ratio 
is 1.33, which corresponds to a median survival for docetaxel of 6 months versus 4.5 months 
for ZD1839.  Based on the sample size assumptions, the required cumulative events for the 
interim analysis are expected about 8 months prior to the end of recruitment. 
There will be no alpha adjustment for the final statistical analysis since there will be no 
opportunity at the interim to reject non-inferiority for overall survival. 
The sample size assumptions will be re-evaluated at the interim analysis based on the overall 
survival, pattern of recruitment, and loss to follow-up.  The minimum follow-up of the study 
may be revised as appropriate.

ZD1839 

9.3 
9.3.1 
There is currently no known antidote for ZD1839.  The treatment of AEs associated with 
overdose should be supportive for the underlying adverse symptoms.

Clinical Study Protocol:  Amended 
Study Code 1839IL/0721  
Edition Number 1 
Date:  14th September 2004 

Doses of study treatment in excess of that specified in the clinical study protocol are 
considered to be an overdose.  Overdose, with or without associated symptoms should be 
handled in the same way as a SAE and sent to AstraZeneca Drug Safety.  Signs or symptoms 
of an overdose that meet the criteria of serious should be reported as a SAE in the appropriate 
timeframes (see Section 4.7.1.3.) and be documented as clinical sequelae to an overdose. 

Docetaxel 

9.3.2 
There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdosage.  In case of overdosage, the patient 
should be kept in a specialized unit where vital functions can be closely monitored.  
Anticipated complications of overdosage include:  bone marrow suppression, peripheral 
neurotoxicity, and mucositis.  Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible 
after discovery of overdose.  Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as 
needed. 

Procedures in case of pregnancy 

9.4 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational 
product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive treatment.  All reports of 
congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Elective terminations of pregnancy for 
medical reasons, and any serious complications of pregnancy (including spontaneous 
miscarriage) should be reported as SAEs.  Elective terminations of pregnancy for non-medical 
reasons without complications should not be handled as AEs. 

All pregnancies including pregnancies in partners of male patients who are being treated with 
ZD1839 or docetaxel should be reported using the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form.  The 
first part of the form is used to collect information before the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known.  This should be completed as soon as possible after it has been identified that the 
patient received an AstraZeneca product during pregnancy.  It should be sent to AstraZeneca, 
Drug Safety within 45 days.  The second part of the form records the outcome of the 
pregnancy and should be sent to AstraZeneca Drug Safety within AE or SAE timeframes if 
appropriate.  Reports of normal outcomes should be sent within 45 days. 

The time period for collecting information on the occurrence of a pregnancy is from first 
administration of study treatment up to and including the follow-up period. 

The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth 
or congenital abnormality/birth defects) must be followed up and documented (on the 
pregnancy outcome report form) even if the patient was discontinued from the study.
