Criteria 

 
Original Text 
•  Age 65 years or 

older  

 
New/Revised Text 
•  Subject is not a 

candidate for high-dose 
chemotherapy with stem 
cell transplantation due 
to: 
age - subject is 65 years 
or older 

− 

−  OR in subjects less than 

65 years of age - 
presence of important 
comorbid … negative 
impact on tolerability of 
high-dose chemotherapy 
with stem cell 
transplantation. Sponsor 
review … and approval 
is required before 
randomization. 
 

•  … related organ or 

tissue damage.37 
Asymptomatic multiple 
myeloma-related organ 
or tissue … indicated 
below are met. 
 

•  … serum monoclonal 
protein value (>1 g/dL 
of IgG or IgM M-
protein, >0.5 g/dL of 
IgA M-protein, … 

4.2. Inclusion 
Criteria (continued) 

•  … related organ 

or tissue 
damage.37 

 

•  … serum 

monoclonal 
protein value 
(>1 g/dL of IgG 
M-protein, 
>0.5 g/dL of IgA 
M-protein, … 
 

Description and 
Rationale 
Nontransplant protocol 
will also allow subjects 
who are non-transplant 
candidates for other 
medical reasons than age. 
Please note that subject 
choice or lack of 
availability of the 
high-dose chemotherapy 
with stem cell 
transplantation option at 
study site is not sufficient 
rationale for fulfilling this 
criterion.

Blood samples for PK 
sampling should be collected 
from the arm contralateral … 
(i.e., opposite arms should be 
used for PK sampling and 
VELCADE administration). 
 

Description and 
Rationale 
Subjects with a high 
baseline tumor load, when 
having a rapid and 
profound response to the 
study drug, may 
experience tumor lysis 
syndrome. Adequate 
hydration and treatment 
with allopurinol is part of 
the prevention and 
treatment of tumor lysis 
syndrome. 
 
As indicated in 
Section 1.2, reactivation of 
herpes zoster is a potential 
risk of VELCADE. 
Antiviral prophylaxis 
decreases the risk of 
herpes zoster reactivation, 
especially in this elderly 
subject population. 
 
By sampling in the arm 
contralateral to the site of 
administration, 
overestimating the 
concentration of 
VELCADE in plasma will 
be avoided. 
 
Since time to progression 
is the primary endpoint of 
this study it is essential 
that we collect all 
information on disease 
progression, even after any 
subsequent treatment has 
started. Therefore, subjects 
will be followed until PD 
even if subsequent therapy 
is started.

Rationale 
Subjects with a high

treatment medication, may 
experience tumor lysis 
syndrome in which high 
amounts of electrolytes are 
set free in the blood. 
Additional blood sampling 
for chemistry labs in 
subjects at risk will 
improve safety monitoring 
for these subjects. 
 
There is concern that early 
termination of treatment in 
case of IF-negative CR 
may lead to insufficient 
duration of treatment and 
early relapse. As long as 
study treatment is 
tolerated, subjects may 
benefit from continued 
treatment as it may 
prolong the duration of the

As a consequence of the outcome of the third 
interim analysis, and in line with protocol 
section 11.5, the subjects in MP treatment 
group who are still receiving treatment are 
given the option to cross-over to Vc-MP for 
the remainder of their treatment period. 

After the third interim analysis and as of 01 
January 2008, the investigator will no longer 
be required to assess and report subject 
response to therapy using efficacy 
measurements and disease response criteria 
as described in Section 9.3. The subjects’ 
disease status may be further followed as per 
the local institution guidelines. 
The Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC), on 13 September 2007, 
has notified the sponsor that, on the occasion 
of the third interim analysis, the pre-specified 
statistical boundary for TTP has been 
crossed. Because of the highly significant 
difference in efficacy endpoints observed 
between the 2 treatment arms, in favor of the 
Vc-MP treatment group, as well as a 
favorable benefit risk ratio for the study, the 
IDMC releases the third interim data to the 
Sponsors’ Steering Committee. 
Based on IDMC recommendations, the 
Sponsor has decided to unblind the study and 
to analyze efficacy and safety data and to 
report results. The updated OS analysis will 
be performed when 174 deaths (2/3 of the 
total number of deaths planned) have been 
observed to confirm the early survival benefit 
observed. The O’Brien-Fleming alpha

An Open-Label, Randomized Study of VELCADE™/Melphalan/Prednisone Versus 
Melphalan/Prednisone in Subjects With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma  
 
SYNOPSIS 
OBJECTIVES: 
The  primary  efficacy  objective  of  this  study  is  to  determine  whether  the  addition  of  VELCADE 
(Bortezomib  for  Injection)  to  standard  melphalan/prednisone  (MP)  therapy  improves  the  time  to 
disease progression (TTP) in subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma.  

The secondary objectives of this study are to determine whether the addition of VELCADE to standard 
MP therapy in subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma improves the following: overall 
survival  (OS),  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  complete  response  (CR)  rate,  overall  response  rate 
(CR +  partial  response  [PR]),  time  to  response,  and  duration  of  response.  An  additional  secondary 
objective  is  to  measure  and  test  global  health  status  as  measured  by  the  European  Organization  for 
Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  (EORTC)  QLQ-C30,  a  patient–reported  outcome  (PRO) 
instrument. 

Other  objectives  include  collection  of  medical  resource  utilization  (MRU)  information  and  use  of  a 
preference-based PRO instrument (EQ-5D) to calculate utility values, both of which may be used in 
future economic evaluation models.  

Safety of the VELCADE/melphalan/prednisone (Vc-MP) combination will also be assessed including 
selected measures of clinical benefit (e.g., incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 infections). 

The impact of melphalan and prednisone on the clinical pharmacokinetics of VELCADE will also be 
evaluated. 

Exploratory objectives of this study are pharmacogenomics and proteomics. Pharmacogenomics will 
evaluate  variations  in  drug  metabolizing  genes  and  their  relationship  to  pharmacokinetic  disposition 
parameters  as  well  as  variations  in  genes  that  may  be  related  to  response  to  VELCADE  or 
susceptibility to or prognosis of multiple myeloma. Proteomics will explore the association between 
patterns of proteins, peptides, or small molecule components in serum, and response to VELCADE or 
susceptibility to or prognosis of multiple myeloma. 

OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN ∗: 
This  is  a  randomized,  open-label,  multicenter  study  consisting  of  3 phases:  a  Prerandomization 
(Screening) Phase, an Open-label Treatment Phase, and a Posttreatment Phase. Study eligibility will be 
determined during the Screening Phase. Subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are 
not  candidates  for  high  dose  chemotherapy  with  stem  cell  transplantation  will  be  enrolled. 
Approximately 680 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups  with stratification 
according  to  baseline  beta2-microglobulin,  baseline  albumin  levels,  and  region  (North  America, 
Europe,  other).  Subjects  will  be  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1  allocation  to  receive  either  Vc-MP 
(Treatment  Group A)  or  MP  (Treatment  Group B).  Subjects  in  Treatment  Group A  will  receive 
VELCADE (twice weekly [Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5] for four 6-week cycles [8 doses per cycle] followed 
by once weekly [Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5] for five 6-week cycles [4 doses per cycle]) in combination with 
melphalan  and  prednisone  once  daily  on  Days 1  to  4  of  each  6-week  cycle.  Subjects  in  Treatment 
Group B will receive 9 cycles of melphalan and prednisone once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 6-week 

                                                           

∗     This section of the protocol has been revised. Please refer to the section of this document entitled 
PROTOCOL  AMENDMENTS  (Amendment INT-5,  12  February  2008)  for  a  detailed 
description of the specific changes.

cycle.  For  both  groups,  treatment  will  continue  for  a  maximum  of  9 cycles  (54 weeks)  and  will  be 
discontinued if disease progression or an unacceptable treatment-related toxicity occurs, or if a subject 
withdraws consent. Throughout the Open-label Treatment and Posttreatment Phases, the investigator 
will  assess  the  subject’s  response  to  therapy  using  the  results  of  efficacy  evaluations  conducted  at 
equivalent frequency in each treatment group and by implementing defined disease response criteria. 
In the Posttreatment Phase, subjects will be followed until death or a maximum of 4.5 years after the 
last subject is randomly assigned to treatment in the study. The primary endpoint is TTP. Secondary 
endpoints include OS, PFS, CR rate, overall response rate, time to response, duration of response, and 
PROs. Efficacy assessments include: myeloma protein measurements in serum and 24-hour urine, bone 
marrow  examination,  skeletal  survey,  documentation  of  extramedullary  plasmacytomas,  and  serum 
calcium  adjusted  for  albumin.  Patient-reported  outcomes  will  be  assessed  in  this  study  through  the 
EORTC  QLQ-C30,  the  Functional  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illnesses–Fatigue  (FACIT-F),  and  the 
EQ-5D  scales.  Medical  resource  utilization  information  will  also  be  collected  throughout  the  study. 
Full  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  will  be  created  for  VELCADE  using  blood  samples  from  a 
subset of approximately 16 subjects in Treatment Group A. Safety  will be evaluated throughout the 
study by assessment of adverse events including selected measures of clinical benefit, and changes in 
physical  examinations,  Karnofsky  performance  status  scores,  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer 
Therapy/Gynecologic  Oncology  Group-Neurotoxicity  (FACT/GOG-Ntx)  scores,  vital  signs,  and 
clinical laboratory findings. The FACT/GOG-Ntx scale will be used as a checklist to assist with the 
clinical safety evaluation of neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy symptoms. Protocol-specified 
dose modifications of VELCADE, melphalan, or prednisone will be made, as necessary. Subjects will 
be evaluated for toxicity before any new dose of study drug is prescribed. Investigators will focus on 
hematologic toxicity (especially thrombocytopenia), on early indications of neuropathy, and on other 
nonhematologic toxicity. Doses can be held or reduced based on the severity of and the recovery from 
a previous toxicity. Dose re-escalations are not allowed for any of the study drugs. 

Three interim analyses are planned. The first interim analysis, for safety monitoring, will be performed 
when  approximately  100 subjects  (50 per  arm)  have  been  on  study  long  enough  to  complete  1 
treatment cycle (all doses of melphalan and prednisone, and at least 6 of the 8 doses of VELCADE) or 
have  been  terminated  early.  The  second  interim  analysis,  to  re-evaluate  the  sample  size  based  on 
accumulated  study  data  and  to  monitor  safety  data,  will  be  performed  when  approximately 
570 subjects have been enrolled. The third interim analysis will be performed when approximately two 
thirds  of  the  events  (260 events)  have  been  observed  or  1 year  has  elapsed  after  the  second  interim 
analysis,  whichever  comes  first.  An  independent  statistician  will  perform  interim  analyses.  An 
Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)  will  meet  following  completion  of  each  interim 
analysis to evaluate safety data and results of the prospectively defined interim analysis of efficacy.  

Pharmacogenetic and proteomic/metabolomic exploratory analyses are planned on blood samples from 
subjects who agree to participate in these parts of the study.  

Based  on  IDMC  recommendations,  the  Sponsor  has  decided  to  unblind  the  study  and  to  analyze 
efficacy and safety data and to report results. As a consequence of the highly significant difference in 
efficacy endpoints observed between the 2 treatment arms in favor of the Vc-MP treatment group, as 
well as a favorable benefit risk ratio for the study, the following changes will become effective: 

•  The pre-specified statistical boundaries for the primary endpoint TTP and the secondary endpoints 

PFS and ORR have been crossed, no further analyses will be performed.  
In line with protocol section 11.5, the subjects in the MP treatment group are given the option to 
crossover to Vc-MP for remaining treatment.  

• 

•  An update of the analysis on OS will be performed when approximately 174 subjects have died.

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 
SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED) 
•  Data collection: survival data, subsequent therapy data, and safety data (including recovery data) 

will continue to be collected as specified in the protocol; however, collection of other efficacy data 
and PRO data will be terminated as of 01 January 2008. 

STUDY POPULATION:  
The subject population comprises male and female subjects, who have symptomatic multiple myeloma 
or  asymptomatic  multiple  myeloma  with  related  organ  or  tissue  damage,  presence  of  measurable 
disease, Karnofsky performance status score greater than or equal to 60%, and clinical hematology and 
chemistry  laboratory  values  that  meet  predefined  criteria.  It  is  expected  that  approximately 
680 subjects  will  be  enrolled.  Potential  subjects  will  be  excluded  who  are  candidates  for  high-dose 
chemotherapy  with  stem  cell  transplantation;  have  a  diagnosis  of  smoldering  multiple  myeloma, 
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), or Waldenström’s disease; have had 
prior or current systemic therapy for multiple myeloma; have had radiation therapy, plasmapheresis, or 
major surgery within 30 days before randomization; or have peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain, 
Grade 2 or higher.  

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION *: 
According  to  the  randomized  treatment  assignment,  subjects  will  receive  either  Vc-MP  (Treatment 
Group A)  or  MP  (Treatment  Group B).  Subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  will  be  treated  for  a 
maximum of 54 weeks (nine 6-week cycles). Subjects in Treatment Group A will receive four 6-week 
cycles with VELCADE 1.3 mg/m2 as a bolus intravenous injection on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 
32 followed by a 10-day rest period (Days 33 to 42), and oral melphalan 9 mg/m2 and oral prednisone 
60 mg/m2 once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 6-week cycle, followed by a 38-day rest period (Days 5 to 
42). The next five 6-week cycles will consist of VELCADE 1.3 mg/m2 as a bolus intravenous injection 
on  Days 1,  8,  22,  and  29  followed  by  a  12-day  rest  period  (Days 30  to  42),  and  oral  melphalan, 
9 mg/m2 and oral prednisone 60 mg/m2 once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 6-week cycle, followed by a 
38-day  rest  period  (Days 5  to  42).  Subjects  in  Treatment  Group B  will  receive  9 cycles  with  oral 
melphalan 9 mg/m2 and oral prednisone 60 mg/m2 once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 6-week cycle, 
followed  by  a  38-day  rest  period  (Days 5  to  42).  Dose  modifications  of  VELCADE,  melphalan,  or 
prednisone  for  toxicities  will  be  allowed.  Two  dose  reductions  are  permitted  for  VELCADE 
(1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2 and 1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2). Two dose reductions are permitted for melphalan 
(9 mg/m2 to 6.75 mg/m2 and 6.75 mg/m2 to 4.5 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2 to 45 mg/m2 and 45 
mg/m2 to 30 mg/m2).  

As a consequence of the outcome of the third interim analysis, and in line with protocol section 11.5, 
the subjects in the MP treatment group who are still receiving treatment after Amendment INT-5 are 
given the option to cross-over to Vc-MP for the remainder of their treatment period. 

PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS: 
Pharmacokinetic  sampling  will  be  performed  at  a  subset  of  investigational  centers.  Full  plasma 
concentration-time  profiles  of  VELCADE  will  be  obtained  from  approximately  16 subjects  in 
Treatment  Group A.  On  Day 25  of  Cycle 1  (without  coadministration  with  MP)  and  on  Day 4  of 
Cycle 2 (with coadministration with MP), blood samples will be collected immediately before dosing, 
and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 24 hours after VELCADE administration. Subjects 
who  do  not  complete  the  pharmacokinetic  assessment  will  be  replaced  so  that  full  profiles  from 
16 subjects are obtained. Concentrations of VELCADE in plasma will be determined using a validated 

                                                           

*     This section of the protocol has been revised. Please refer to the section of this document entitled 
PROTOCOL  AMENDMENTS  (Amendment INT-5,  12  February  2008)  for  a  detailed 
description of the specific changes.

SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED) 
LC-MS/MS  method.  Pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  VELCADE  will  be  calculated  using 
noncompartmental methods.  

EFFICACY EVALUATIONS/CRITERIA *:  
Efficacy evaluations will be based on changes in myeloma protein measurements in serum and 24-hour 
urine, bone marrow examination, skeletal survey, extramedullary plasmacytomas, and serum calcium 
adjusted  for  albumin.  The  sponsor  will  assess  progressive  disease  and  response  according  to  the 
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) criteria. In addition, clinical relapse will 
be assessed according to the recently published International Uniform Response Criteria for multiple 
myeloma  established  by  the  International  Myeloma  Working  Group  (IMWG).1  An  attempt  will  be 
made  to  collect  data  for  the  assessment  of  stringent  complete  response  (sCR)  if  these  data  are 
available. 

The primary efficacy endpoint, TTP, will be measured in months from the date of randomization to the 
date of the first observation of either disease progression or relapse from immunofixation-negative CR, 
on the basis of EBMT criteria.  

Secondary  endpoints  include:  OS  (time  between  randomization  and  death);  PFS  (time  between 
randomization  and  either  disease  progression  or  death,  whichever  occurs  first);  CR  rate;  overall 
response rate (CR + PR); time to response (in subjects with a confirmed response, is the time between 
randomization  and  the  first  documentation  of  response);  duration  of  response  (in  subjects  with 
confirmed response is the time between first documentation of response and disease progression); and 
change in PRO scores. 

After the third interim analysis and as of 01 January 2008, the investigator will no longer be required 
to  assess  and  report  subject  response  to  therapy  using  efficacy  measurements  and  disease  response 
criteria  as  described  in  Section  9.3. The  subjects’ disease  status  may  be  further  followed  as  per  the 
local institution guidelines. 

SAFETY EVALUATIONS: 
Safety evaluations will be based on changes in physical examinations, Karnofsky performance status 
scores,  FACT/GOG-Ntx  scores,  heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  and  clinical  laboratory  findings  from 
pretherapy  to  the  End-of-Treatment  Visit,  and  the  observation  or  report  of  any  adverse  events 
(including laboratory abnormalities reported as adverse events) that occur from the first study-related 
procedure  until  30 days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug  or  until  the  start  of  subsequent  systemic 
antimyeloma therapy, if earlier, and those adverse events (including laboratory abnormalities reported 
as adverse events) occurring after 30 days if considered related to study drug. The intensity (severity) 
of adverse events will be assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Version 3.0.  

STATISTICAL METHODS: 
The  sample  size  calculation  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  median  TTP  for  the  MP  arm  is 
18 months.  Assuming  Vc-MP  can  improve  TTP  by  33%,  i.e.,  assuming  the  hazard  ratio  (MP  vs. 
Vc-MP) of 1.33, the total number of events needed for the study is a minimum of 390 (power is 80% 
and  2-sided  alpha  is  0.05).  With  an  18-month  accrual  period  and  an  18-month  follow  up,  the  total 
sample size needed for the study is approximately 680 (340/arm) subjects. The sample size calculation 
has taken a 5% dropout rate into consideration.

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 
SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED) 
Data on demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for each treatment group. The 
primary  endpoint  analysis  will  consist  of  a  stratified  log-rank  test  for  the  comparison  of  the  TTP 
distribution  between  the  2 treatments.  Stratification  factors  include  beta2-microglobulin  (<2.5 mg/L, 
2.5  to  5.5 mg/L,  >5.5 mg/L),  albumin  (<3.5 g/dL  and  ≥3.5 g/dL  [SI  Units:  <35 g/L,  ≥35 g/L]),  and 
region  (North  America,  Europe,  other).  The  Kaplan-Meier  method  will  be  used  to  estimate  the 
distribution of overall TTP for each treatment. The secondary endpoint analyses consist of a stratified 
log-rank  test  for  comparison  of  the  OS  and  PFS  between  treatments,  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  to 
estimate the distribution of OS and PFS for each treatment, the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test 
for comparison of the CR rates and objective response rates between the 2 treatment groups, and the 
95% confidence interval of the difference of the response rates between the 2 treatments. Additionally, 
the time to response will be compared using a log-rank test and duration of response will be provided 
descriptively with response rate. The PFS analysis will also be considered as a sensitivity analysis for 
the  primary  endpoint,  TTP.  The  primary  endpoint  for  the  PRO  analysis  will  be  the  global  health 
status/quality of life subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30. The change in PRO scores between baseline 
and each postbaseline assessment will be described overall and according to the response to treatment.  

Detailed tabulations of safety data (adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, Karnofsky status 
scores,  FACT/GOG-Ntx  scores,  and  clinical  laboratory  tests)  will  be  provided  for  all  subjects  who 
received study drug. The number and percent of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events will 
be summarized. Selected measures of clinical benefit, e.g., frequency of Grade 3 or Grade 4 infections 
will  be  provided.  The  analysis  of  FACT/GOG-Ntx  scores  will  include  change  from  baseline  and 
relationship of scores to treatment-related events. Summaries of other safety parameters by treatment 
group will also be provided where appropriate.  
The primary parameters of interest for the pharmacokinetic statistical analysis will be AUC24h and Cmax 
of  VELCADE.  The  analysis  will  be  performed  on  log-transformed  estimated  pharmacokinetic 
parameters.  Mixed  effects  models  will  be  fit  to  the  data  with  one  of  the  estimated  pharmacokinetic 
parameters of interest as the dependent variable, treatment as fixed effect, and subject as a random effect. 
The estimated least square means and intrasubject variance from the mixed effects model will be used to 
construct 90% confidence intervals for the difference in means on the log scale between the 2 treatments. 
The limits of the confidence intervals will be retransformed using antilogarithms to obtain 90% confidence 
intervals  for  the  ratio  of  the  mean  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  VELCADE  with  and  without 
coadministration of melphalan and prednisone.

TIME AND EVENTS SCHEDULE (CONTINUED) 

Vc-MP = VELCADE/melphalan/prednisone; MP = melphalan/prednisone; D = Day 
a  Procedures recorded below are to be repeated with each treatment cycle except as noted. 
b  For subjects who discontinue study drug before disease progression and before completion of the 54 weeks of treatment in the Open-label, Treatment Phase, posttreatment assessments should continue 

every 3 weeks (serum quantitative immunoglobulins, serum and 24-hour urine M-protein assessments, and serum calcium corrected for albumin every 3 weeks; and radiology for extramedullary 
plasmacytomas and completion of PRO questionnaires every 6 weeks) for the remainder of the 54 weeks after the date of randomization, then every 8 weeks thereafter. For subjects who complete the 
54 weeks of treatment in the Open-label Treatment Phase before disease progression, posttreatment visits will be performed every 8 weeks. After disease progression is documented, subsequent 
treatment and survival status will be documented at least every 12 weeks. Evidence of clinical relapse will also be documented at the time at which it is first detected.  

c  Results of tests obtained prior to signing of the informed consent as part of the subject’s standard care can be used for this study if performed within 21 days before randomization. 
d  PRO questionnaires to be completed before other assessments are performed or study drug is administered. MRUs are collected continuously throughout the study. 
e  Performed by central laboratory. Only one serum and one 24-hour urine sample is required by the central laboratory to perform quantitative immunoglobulin, SPEP, UPEP, and serum and urine 

immunofixation testing.  

If blood and 24-hour urine samples collected at screening were taken within 14 days before Cycle 1, Day 1, then it is not mandatory to collect these samples again at Cycle 1, Day 1 visit. 

f  Subjects with immunofixation-negative nonsecretory multiple myeloma are not required to provide a serum or 24-hour urine sample after Screening. 
g 
h  Samples collected until the development of confirmed PD, if this test is the basis for the evidence of PD, then this evaluation is to be confirmed by a second measurement 1 to 3 weeks later. 
i  To identify the isotype prior to therapy, then during treatment at times of response assessment when a CR is suspected (that is when the serum or 24-hour urine M-protein is 0 or nonquantifiable).  

After a subject has confirmed CR, the central laboratory should perform serum and urine immunofixation every time a SPEP and UPEP are performed. A positive immunofixation with confirmation is 
sufficient to assess relapse from CR. 

If known or suspected extramedullary plasmacytomas. 

j  To be performed at baseline. Postbaseline tests performed if indicated by symptoms.  
k 
l  Same diagnostic test as baseline should be used for all assessments. 
m  Cycles 2 to 9: Only performed if baseline extramedullary plasmacytomas were documented. May be performed at anytime if indicated due to suspicion of new plasmacytomas. 
n  Perform at baseline and if a CR is suspected. Only 1 sample is needed to document a CR in subjects with secretory myeloma – no confirmatory test is needed. In nonsecretory and oligosecretory 

subjects, the test must be repeated and confirmed if a CR is suspected. During the Screening Phase, 2 bone marrow samples are to be collected for evaluation by the local laboratory, 1 for morphology 
and 1 for cytogenetics. For repeat samples, 1 bone marrow sample is required for morphology evaluation. 

If the screening labs were taken within 5 days before Cycle 1, Day 1 dosing, it is not necessary to repeat these tests on Cycle 1, Day 1. 

o  An additional hematology test can be scheduled at the investigator’s discretion in the treatment-free weeks (Week 3 and Week 6). 
p 
q  Hb, WBC, platelet count, and ANC results required before dosing. 
r  Laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry) may be performed within 24 hours before each day. 
s  Only those subjects with VELCADE administration scheduled.  
t  Chemistries include sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, calcium, creatinine, BUN/urea, uric acid, glucose (random), total bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, and albumin. If female 

subjects are still having menstrual periods and are not surgically sterile, they must have a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test at screening. Pregnancy tests (serum or urine) may be repeated 
throughout the study at the discretion of the investigator. 
In subjects at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (such as Stage III of Salmon-Durie Staging or Stage II of the ISS Staging) it is also recommended to test electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, 
and phosphate), uric acid, creatinine, BUN/urea) during the first cycle every time that a hematology sample is scheduled. Additionally, for subjects at risk for tumor lysis syndrome, allopurinol 
treatment should be considered and special attention should be given to adequate hydration. 

v  Sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, and BUN/urea results required before dosing.  
w  Predose (immediately prior to dosing) and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 24 hours after VELCADE administration. All blood samples are to be drawn from a peripheral vein. Blood 

u 

samples will be collected from approximately 16 subjects in Treatment Group A at selected investigational centers.

INTRODUCTION 
VELCADE  (Bortezomib  for  Injection)  is  a  small  molecule  proteasome 
inhibitor  being  codeveloped  by  Millennium  Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. 
(Millennium)  and  Johnson  &  Johnson  Pharmaceutical  Research  & 
Development (J&JPRD).  

The term Sponsor used throughout this document refers to the entities listed 
in  the  Contact  Information  page(s),  which  will  be  provided  as  a  separate 
document. 

1.1.  Background 

VELCADE  is  a  small  molecule  proteasome  inhibitor.  It  is  currently 
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by 
the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) for the 
treatment of multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least 2 prior 
therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.2,3 
Remarkable  antitumor  activity  of  VELCADE  has  also  been  observed  in 
earlier disease phases of multiple myeloma (refer to Section 1.1.4, Clinical 
Experience of VELCADE). The drug is currently being tested in a variety of 
other hematologic and solid tumors. 

By inhibiting a single molecular target, the proteasome, VELCADE affects 
multiple signaling pathways. The antineoplastic effect of VELCADE likely 
involves several distinct mechanisms, including inhibition of cell growth and 
survival  pathways,  induction  of  apoptosis,  and  inhibition  of  expression  of 
genes that control cellular adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Thus, the 
mechanisms  by  which  VELCADE  elicits  its  antitumor  activity  may  vary 
among tumor types, and the extent to which each affected pathway is critical 
to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ. VELCADE has a novel 
pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo 
assays.4 In addition, VELCADE has shown cytotoxic activity in a variety of 
xenograft  tumor  models,  both  as  a  single  agent  and  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy  and  radiation.5-9  Notably,  VELCADE  induces  apoptosis  in 
cells that over express bcl-2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth 
and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.10 

VELCADE  is  thought  to  be  efficacious  in  multiple  myeloma  via  its 
inhibition  of  nuclear  factor  κB  (NF-κB)  activation,  its  attenuation  of

interleukin-6-mediated  cell  growth,  a  direct  apoptotic  effect,  and  possibly 
antiangiogenic and other effects.11 

Nonclinical Pharmacology 

1.1.1. 
Pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  conducted  in  the  rat 
and  cynomolgus  monkey.  Upon 
intravenous  bolus  administration, 
VELCADE displays a rapid distribution phase (t1/2α <10 minutes) followed 
by a longer elimination phase (t1/2β 5 to 15 hours). VELCADE has a large 
volume  of  distribution  (range  5  to  50 L/kg).  The  plasma  pharmacokinetic 
profile is consistent with a 2-compartment model. 

The pharmacodynamic action of VELCADE is well established and can be 
measured through an ex vivo assay (20S proteasome activity).12 This assay 
was  used  to  determine  the  duration  of  drug  effect  in  lieu  of  the 
pharmacokinetic data in the early preclinical toxicology studies as well as to 
set a guide for dose escalation in humans. 

Following  dosing  with  VELCADE  in  the  rat  and  cynomolgus  monkey, 
proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood had a half-life less than 24 hours, 
with proteasome activity returning to pretreatment baseline within 24 hours 
in  monkeys  and  within  48  to  72 hours  in  rats  after  a  single  dose  of 
VELCADE. Further, intermittent but high inhibition (>70%) of proteasome 
activity was better tolerated than sustained inhibition.  

Nonclinical Toxicity 

1.1.2. 
Single-dose intravenous toxicity studies were conducted with VELCADE in 
the  mouse,  rat,  dog,  and  monkey  to  establish  the  single-dose  maximum 
tolerated  dose  (MTD).  The  MTDs  were  0.25 mg/kg  (1.5 mg/m2)  and 
0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the 2 most sensitive species, rat and monkey. 

Repeat-dose  multicycle  toxicity  studies  of  3  and  6 months  in  the  rat  and 
9 months  in  the  monkey,  each  with  8-week  recovery  periods,  were 
conducted  to  characterize  the  chronic  toxicity  of  VELCADE  when 
administered by the clinical route and regimen of administration. The MTD 
in  the  6-month  rat  study  was  0.10 mg/kg  (0.6 mg/m2)  and  the  key  target 
organs were the gastrointestinal tract, hematopoietic, and lymphoid systems. 
The MTD in the 9-month monkey study was 0.05 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the 
key target organs were the gastrointestinal tract, and the hematopoietic and 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

43

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

lymphoid  systems,  peripheral  nervous  system,  and  kidney.  Full  or  partial 
reversibility was observed for each of the toxicities described to date.  

In general, the nature of the toxicity of VELCADE is similar across species, 
and  target  organs  of  toxicity  in  animals  have  been  largely  predictive  of 
human toxicity. The doses used in the pivotal repeat-dose studies are in the 
same order of magnitude of the clinical dose of 1.3 mg/m2. The toxicity of 
VELCADE  in  animals  is  characterized  by  a  steep  dose  response  with 
mortality  seen  at  dosages  above  the  MTD.  The  cause  of  death  at  acutely 
lethal  dosages  is  considered  to  be  related  to  cardiovascular  effects  of 
hypotension  and  vascular  changes  with  initial  physiologically  significant 
heart rate elevations, which preceded a profound hypotension and eventual 
bradycardia. The cause of death in long-term studies has been attributed to 
gastrointestinal  or  hematologic  toxicity.  The  pharmacologic  effects  of 
the  cardiovascular  system  have  been  extensively 
VELCADE  on 
characterized. 
indirect  effects  on 
cardiovascular  function  occur  only  at  acutely  lethal  dosages  and  are 
abrogated by routine supportive care. 

It  has  been  demonstrated 

that 

Additional detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology of VELCADE may be found in the Investigator Brochure. 

Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 

1.1.3. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  characterization  of  VELCADE  has  been 
determined  from  Phase 1  studies  in  subjects  with  solid  tumors  and 
hematologic malignancies, and confirmed in Phase 2 studies in subjects with 
multiple myeloma. 

In  subjects  with  solid  tumors,  the  mean  terminal  elimination  half-life  of 
VELCADE  was  9.06 hours.  The  mean  maximum  plasma  concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the curve (AUClast) after the first dose (1.3 mg/m2) of 
VELCADE  were  173 ng/mL  and  48.2 h•ng/mL,  respectively.  The  average 
clearance  of  VELCADE  following  a  single  1.3 mg/m2  dose  was  49.0 L/h. 
However, the AUClast increased to 81.0 h•ng/mL after the third dose in the 
first cycle as a result of a reduction in systemic clearance to 28.2 L/h with a 
consequent 
to  16.6 hours.  Clinical 
experience has shown that the change in clearance does not result in overt 

in  elimination  half-life 

increase

toxicity  from  accumulation  in  this  multidose  regimen  in  humans.  Formal 
pharmacokinetic studies are currently ongoing. 

In  subjects  with  advanced  malignancies,  the  maximum  pharmacodynamic 
effect  (inhibition  of  20S  activity)  occurred  within  1-hour  postdose.  At  the 
therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m2 in subjects with multiple myeloma, the mean 
proteasome inhibition at 1 hour postdose was approximately 61%. 

The  time  course  of  proteasome  inhibition  in  subjects  is  characterized  by 
maximum  inhibition  observed  within  the  first  hour  after  administration, 
followed  by  partial  recovery  of  proteasome  activity,  over  the  next  6  to 
24 hours, to within 50% of the pretreatment activity. On the Day 1, 4, 8, and 
11  schedule,  variable  (10%  to  30%)  levels  of  proteasome  inhibition  have 
been  observed  at  next  scheduled  dosing.  In  theory,  this  recovery  towards 
normal  allows  cells  to  recover  proteasome  activity  for  normal  cellular 
housekeeping functions between doses. 

The relationship between VELCADE plasma concentrations and proteasome 
inhibition  can  be  described  by  a  maximum  effect  (Emax)  model.  The  Emax 
curve  is  initially  very  steep,  with  small  changes  in  plasma  VELCADE 
concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large increases 
in  the  percent  inhibition  (0%  to  60%).  After  that,  a  plateau  occurs  where 
marginal  increases  of  proteasome  inhibition  are  observed  in  spite  of  large 
increases in plasma VELCADE concentrations. 

Clinical Experience of VELCADE 

1.1.4. 
VELCADE has been administered to over 8,000 subjects in clinical studies 
and  through  commercial  use.  Clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  in 
3 clinical  research  programs,  1 sponsored  by  the  clinical  development 
partners  (J&JPRD  and  Millennium),  one  by  investigator-initiated  studies, 
and  the  third  by  the  U.S.  National  Cancer  Institute.  VELCADE  became 
commercially available in the United States after the U.S. FDA approval on 
13 May 2003 and in Europe after the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) 
approval on 26 April 2004. 

The overall goal of the Millennium Phase 1 program was to determine the 
MTD  and  dose-limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  of  VELCADE  in  a  number  of 
therapeutic settings involving subjects with various advanced malignancies.

In  the  3-week  schedule  of  VELCADE  monotherapy  in  subjects  with 
advanced solid tumors (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day 
treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m2 per dose (3 subjects with 
Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with peripheral sensory neuropathy out of 12 treated 
at  that  dose  level).13  Therefore,  the  MTD  at  this  schedule  was  at  least 
1.3 mg/m2 per dose. In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 once-weekly doses of 
VELCADE monotherapy in predominately subjects with advanced prostate 
cancer, the MTD was 1.6 mg/m2 per dose and DLTs occurring at 2.0 mg/m2 
included  hypotension,  tachycardia,  diarrhea,  and  syncope.14  In  a  42-day 
treatment cycle of VELCADE administered twice a week for 4 weeks with 
2 weeks rest in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies, the MTD 
was 1.04 mg/m2 per dose and DLTs were hyponatremia and hypokalemia.15  

In Phase 1 clinical studies, antitumor activity was reported in subjects with 
multiple  myeloma,  Waldenström’s  macroglobulinemia,  non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  nasopharynx,  bronchoalveolar 
carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. 

The safety and efficacy of VELCADE in subjects with pretreated multiple 
myeloma  were  investigated  in  2 Phase 2  clinical  studies:  M34100-024 
(subjects  with  first  relapse)  and  M34100-025  (subjects  with  second  or 
greater relapse and refractory to their last prior therapy). In the M34100-025 
SUMMIT  study,  202 heavily  pretreated  subjects  with  refractory  multiple 
myeloma after at least 2 previous treatments received VELCADE, 1.3 mg/m2 
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle for 8 cycles (24 weeks of 
therapy). The European  Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant response 
criteria, as described by Blade,16 were used to determine disease response. 
An  independent  review  committee  confirmed  these  responses.  Complete 
responses (CRs) were observed in 10% of subjects, including some cases in 
which monoclonal protein (M-protein) was not detected by immunofixation. 
Partial response (PR) or CR was observed in 27% of subjects, and the overall 
response rate (CR, PR, and minor response [MR] combined) was 35%. Of 
the 69 subjects who were 65 years or older, the response rate (CR + PR) for 
those  who  had  response  data  was  19%.  Seventy  percent  of  subjects 
experienced  an  M-protein  reduction  of  25%  or  more.  Responses  occurred 
early  (median  time  to  response  was  6 weeks)  and  were  durable  (median 
duration  of  response  was  12 months).  Median  time  to  progression  for  all

subjects was 7 months and median overall survival (OS) was 16 months. The 
therapy was well tolerated and the incidence of Grade 4 adverse events was 
relatively low.17 The most common adverse events were Grade 1 to Grade 2 
gastrointestinal  adverse  events,  including  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  and 
constipation.  Severe  myelosuppression  was  uncommon.  Thrombocytopenia 
(Grade 3 to Grade 4 in 31% of subjects) occurred primarily in subjects with 
low  baseline  platelet  counts,  and  was  transient.  The  most  clinically 
significant adverse event was a cumulative, dose-related, peripheral sensory 
neuropathy managed by treatment interruptions and dose modifications.17,18 

In  the  M34100-025  study,  subject  self-reported  questionnaires  (European 
Organization  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  [EORTC]  QLQ-C30, 
EORTC QLQ-MY24 [24 item myeloma-specific extension module], and the 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illnesses – Fatigue [FACIT-F] scales; see 
Section 9.3.8,  Patient-Reported  Outcome  Assessments,  for  additional 
information  on  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  FACIT-F  questionnaires)  were 
administered at the screening visit and Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, and at the end 
of  the  study.  In  subjects  with  CR  or  PR,  improvement  from  baseline  on 
global  quality  of  life,  disease  symptoms,  pain,  fatigue,  and  physical 
functioning was observed. 

The  M34101-039  APEX  study,  a  randomized,  Phase 3  study  comparing 
VELCADE  with  high-dose  dexamethasone  in  669 subjects  with  multiple 
myeloma  after  1  to  3 prior  lines  of  therapy  was  halted  at  the  time  of  the 
interim analysis because of a statistically significant improvement in time to 
disease progression (TTP) in favor of the VELCADE arm. In this study, the 
experimental  arm  received  VELCADE  1.3 mg/m2  on  Days 1,  4,  8,  and  11 
every  3 weeks  for  8 cycles  (24 weeks)  followed  by  a  less  dose-intense 
therapy  of  weekly  VELCADE,  1.3 mg/m2  on  Days 1,  8,  15,  and  22  every 
5 weeks (15 weeks), for 3 additional cycles. All subjects on the control arm 
with  high-dose  dexamethasone  were  offered  treatment  with  VELCADE 
therapy.  

Preliminary  data  on  VELCADE  in  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  is 
available from an ongoing, multicenter, Phase 2 study of VELCADE alone 
or  in  combination  with  dexamethasone.  These  early  data  indicate  a  75% 
overall response rate and a 33% CR rate in previously untreated subjects.19

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

Phase 1  combination  studies  indicate  that  VELCADE  at  full  or  nearly  full 
dose  can  safely  be  combined  with  standard  doses  of  myelotoxic 
chemotherapy  agents  such  as  docetaxel,20  gemcitabine,21  and  irinotecan.22 
Two  combination  studies  with  melphalan  are  currently  ongoing.  In  a  U.S. 
Phase 1/2 combination study in relapsed multiple myeloma, 15 subjects have 
been enrolled to date and dose escalation is currently ongoing at the 1 mg/m2 
VELCADE dose level (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 4 weeks) in combination 
with  escalating  doses  of  melphalan  up  to  0.25 mg/kg  (Days 1  to  4  every 
4 weeks). Overall responses were observed in 12 subjects (80%), including 
10 PRs (67%) and 2 MRs (13%).23  

A  European  Phase 1/2  study  has  been  initiated  to  study  VELCADE  in  the 
patient population targeted in this study (previously untreated nontransplant 
candidates) in combination with the melphalan and prednisone regimen used 
in this study. In this Phase 1/2 study, 2 different dose levels (1 mg/m2 and 
1.3 mg/m2) of VELCADE (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and Days 22, 25, 28, and 31 
every  6 weeks)  are  being  tested  in  combination  with  oral  melphalan, 
9 mg/m2  and  prednisone  60 mg/m2  on  Days 1  to  4  every  6 weeks.  The 
Phase 1 part of the study has been completed and no DLT has been reported. 
Therefore, the recommended VELCADE dose for Phase 2 testing has been 
determined  at  1.3 mg/m2  and  accrual  to  the  Phase 2  part  has  started.  Six 
subjects were enrolled at the 1.0 mg/m2 dose. In the first 6-week cycle, no 
subject  developed  a  DLT.  One  subject  developed  a  transient  Grade 3 
neutropenia  and  1 subject  developed  a  drug-related  Grade 2  ocular  pain 
lasting for 6 days  and interpreted as  cranial neuropathy; the symptoms did 
not recur upon rechallenge. Three of the 6 subjects at this dose level have 
developed a PR and 2 additional subjects have developed a MR; treatment of 
all  subjects  is  ongoing.  Subsequently,  6 subjects  were  enrolled  at  the 
1.3 mg/m2 dose level. One subject died due to a nondrug-related pulmonary 
embolism  and  septic  shock  11 days  after  the  start  of  therapy.  The  5 other 
subjects  did  not  develop  a  DLT.  One  subject  developed  a  Grade 3  febrile 
neutropenia  of  short  duration  (not  considered  a  DLT  by  protocol)  after  an 
accidental overdose of melphalan (9 mg/m2/d for 9 days instead of 4). One 
other subject developed a reversible Grade 3 neutropenia and another subject 
a reversible Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Of the 5 subjects with postbaseline 
M-protein assessments, all are in PR after the first cycle and are continuing 
therapy. Accrual to the Phase 2 part of the study at the 1.3 mg/m2 dose has

The  most  common  side  effects  of  VELCADE  (i.e.,  incidence  ≥10%) 
observed 
fatigue,  general  discomfort, 
gastrointestinal  effects  (abdominal  pain,  constipation,  diarrhea,  nausea, 
vomiting, and loss of appetite), painful sensations or numbness and tingling 
in hands and feet, which in some cases may not resolve after discontinuation 
of  VELCADE,  flu-like  symptoms  (e.g.,  fever,  chills,  muscle  cramps,  or 
aches), decreases of platelets, neutrophils/white blood cells (WBCs) and red 
blood cells (RBCs), skin rash and itching, decreases in blood pressure, fluid 
retention, dizziness, changes in heart rate and rhythm, pain in limbs, bones, 
joints, muscles, or back, or general pain, shortness of breath, cough, upper 
respiratory  tract  infection,  pneumonia,  headache,  blurred  vision,  altered 
sense  of  taste,  insomnia,  anxiety,  nosebleed,  and  reactivation  of  herpes 
zoster.  

Less  common  side  effects  of  VELCADE  (i.e.,  incidence  >1%  and  <10%) 
observed in subjects are deterioration in kidney and liver function, decrease 
in  blood  sodium  or  blood  potassium,  hepatitis,  severe  bleeding  including 
central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal bleeding associated with 
thrombocytopenia and blood clotting changes, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), 
transient small bowel obstruction in subjects who had prior major abdominal 
surgery,  and  low  blood  sugar  in  a  few  diabetic  subjects  receiving  oral 
antidiabetic  medication.  Acute  development  or  exacerbation  of  congestive 
heart failure has been seen in subjects with risk factors for or existing heart 
disease.  

Although rare (i.e., incidence <1%), VELCADE may cause allergic reactions 
(fever,  severe  skin  rash,  joint  swelling,  and  pain)  and  anaphylactic  shock. 
Complications arising from these VELCADE toxicities may result in death.  

Further  details  on  the  potential  risks  of  VELCADE  may  be  found  in  the 
Investigator Brochure.

Treatment  with  melphalan  and  prednisone  (MP)  has  been  the  standard  of 
care  in  front-line  nontransplant  multiple  myeloma  therapy  since  the 
randomized  study  by  Alexanian  et  al  in  1969.25  In  the  Alexanian  study, 
combination  therapy  with  MP,  given  orally  for  4  consecutive  days  every 
6 weeks,  had  a  superior  survival  versus  melphalan  alone.  Multiple  other 
combination  chemotherapy  agents  have  subsequently  been  tested 
in 
randomized  studies  against  MP  with  no  effect  on  response  duration  or  on 
OS.27  (See  Section 3.2.2,  Melphalan  and  Prednisone  Dosing  Regimen,  for 
additional information.) 

tests  only  and  not  on 

With treatment using MP, an overall response rate of 53% is obtained with a 
median time to response of 3 to 5 months.26-29 Complete remissions, reported 
in  only  2%  of  patients  treated  with  MP,  have  been  based  on  negative 
immunoelectrophoresis 
the  more  sensitive 
immunofixation test. Two thirds of patients will achieve at least a PR or a 
plateau  phase  (defined  as  stable  paraprotein  levels  for  3 months  and 
transfusion independence).30 Many patients will remain on initial therapy for 
up  to  1 year.  Reported  median  TTP  is  18 months  (16  to  21 months).31-34 
Reported  median  OS  numbers  are  generally  between  30 months32  and 
36 months.29,33,34 

Treatment with oral MP is generally well tolerated. The primary side effect 
of  melphalan,  an  alkylating  agent, 
is  bone  marrow  suppression. 
Thrombocytopenia  (Grade 2  or  higher  reported  in  20%  of  patients)  and 
neutropenia  (Grade 2  or  higher  reported  in  40%  to  50%  of  patients)  are 
generally reversible, but recovery can take several weeks.35-37 As melphalan 
is  stem-cell  toxic,  its  use  is  not  recommended  if  stem  cell  harvesting  is 
planned.38  Gastrointestinal  disturbances  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  and 
diarrhea occur infrequently with melphalan. Treatment with prednisone can 
induce steroid side effects, such as hyperglycemia, fluid retention, increased 
appetite, or behavioral changes in susceptible patients. 

1.4.  Overall Rationale for the Study 

Chemotherapy is indicated for patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic 
myeloma,  while  it  is  generally  not  recommended  for  patients  with

significance 

monoclonal  gammopathy  of  undetermined 
(MGUS), 
smoldering,  or  asymptomatic  myeloma.  Age,  performance  status,  and 
comorbid conditions are critical factors in the choice of initial therapy. The 
current recommendation is to incorporate high-dose chemotherapy with stem 
cell transplant into initial therapy programs  for  patients 65 years of  age  or 
younger and to consider such therapy for patients 60 to 70 years of age with 
good performance status and lack of comorbid illnesses.38  

The standard frontline therapy for patients 65 years of age or older, who are 
not likely to proceed to high-dose  chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, 
consists  of  oral  melphalan  and  prednisone.25,38  Multiple  combinations  of 
alkylating-agent-based  chemotherapy 
in 
randomized  studies  against  MP  with  no  beneficial  effect  on  response 
duration  or  OS.26  In  these  non-high-dose  chemotherapy  with  stem  cell 
transplant candidates, the goal of initial therapy is to achieve a response and 
to  treat  until  complete  remission  (rare)  or  a  plateau  phase  followed  by  a 
break in therapy until evidence of progression.  

regimens  have  been 

tested 

On  the  basis  of  results  of  VELCADE  as  a  single  agent  in  pretreated  and 
untreated  patients  with  multiple  myeloma  (as  described  in  Section 1.1.4, 
Clinical Experience of VELCADE), this study is designed to determine if the 
addition  of  VELCADE  to  the  standard  therapy  of  MP  will  improve  the 
outcome of previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma for whom 
stem cell collection is not planned.  

2. 

OBJECTIVES 
The  primary  efficacy  objective  of  this  study  is  to  determine  whether  the 
addition of VELCADE to standard melphalan and prednisone (MP) therapy 
improves the time to progression (TTP) in subjects with previously untreated 
multiple myeloma.  

The secondary objectives of this study are to determine whether the addition 
of VELCADE to standard MP therapy in subjects with previously untreated 
multiple  myeloma 
(OS), 
progression-free  survival  (PFS),  complete  response  (CR)  rate,  overall 
response  rate  (CR  +  PR),  time  to  response,  and  duration  of  response.  An 
additional secondary objective is to measure and test global health status as 

following:  overall  survival 

improves

measured  by  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30,  a  patient-reported  outcome  (PRO) 
instrument.  

Other  objectives  include  collection  of  medical  resource  utilization  (MRU) 
information  and  use  of  a  preference-based  PRO  instrument  (EQ-5D)  to 
calculate  utility  values,  both  of  which  may  be  used  in  future  economic 
evaluation models. 

Safety  of  the  VELCADE/melphalan/prednisone  (Vc-MP)  combination  will 
also  be  assessed  including  selected  measures  of  clinical  benefit  (e.g., 
incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 infections).  

The impact of melphalan and prednisone on the clinical pharmacokinetics of 
VELCADE will also be evaluated.  

Exploratory objectives of this study are pharmacogenomics and proteomics. 
Pharmacogenomics will evaluate variations in drug metabolizing genes and 
their  relationship  to  pharmacokinetic  disposition  parameters  as  well  as 
variations  in  genes  that  may  be  related  to  response  to  VELCADE  or 
susceptibility to or prognosis of multiple myeloma. Proteomics will explore 
the  association  between  patterns  of  proteins,  peptides,  or  small  molecule 
components  in  serum,  and  response  to  VELCADE  or  susceptibility  to  or 
prognosis of multiple myeloma. 

OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN 

3. 
3.1.  Study Design* 

This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study consisting of 3 phases: a 
Prerandomization (Screening) phase, an Open-label, Treatment phase, and a 
Posttreatment  phase.  Study  eligibility  will  be  determined  during  the 
Screening Phase. Subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma who 
are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant are 
eligible  for  enrollment.  Approximately  680 subjects  will  be  randomly 
assigned  to  1  of  2 treatment  groups  and  will  be  stratified  according  to 
baseline  beta2-microglobulin,  baseline  albumin  levels,  and  region  (North

PROTOCOL  AMENDMENTS  (Amendment INT-5,  12  February  2008)  for  a  detailed 
description of the specific changes.

America,  Europe,  other).  Subjects  will  be  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1 
allocation to receive either Vc-MP (Treatment Group A) or MP (Treatment 
Group B).  Subjects 
in  Treatment  Group A  will  receive  VELCADE, 
1.3 mg/m2 (twice weekly [Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5] for four 6-week cycles [8 
doses per cycle] followed by once weekly [Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5] for five 6-
week  cycles  [4 doses  per  cycle])  in  combination  with  melphalan  9 mg/m2 
and prednisone 60 mg/m2 (once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 6-week cycle). 
Subjects in Treatment Group B will receive 9 cycles of melphalan, 9 mg/m2 
and prednisone 60 mg/m2 once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 6–week cycle. 
For  both  groups,  treatment  will  continue  for  a  maximum  of  9 cycles 
(54 weeks) and will be discontinued if disease progression or unacceptable 
treatment-related  toxicity  occurs,  or  if  a  subject  withdraws  consent. 
Throughout  the  Open-label,  Treatment  and  Posttreatment  Phases,  the 
investigator will assess the subject’s response to therapy using the results of 
efficacy  evaluations  conducted  at  equivalent  frequency  in  each  treatment 
group  and  by  implementing  defined  disease  response  criteria.  In  the 
Posttreatment Phase, subjects will be followed until death or a maximum of 
4.5 years  after  the  last  subject  is  randomly  assigned  on  the  study.  The 
primary  endpoint  is  TTP.  Secondary  endpoints  include  OS,  PFS,  CR  rate, 
overall  response  rate,  time  to  response,  duration  of  response,  and  PROs. 
Efficacy assessments include: myeloma protein measurements in serum and 
24-hour urine, bone marrow examination, skeletal survey, documentation of 
extramedullary  plasmacytomas,  and  serum  calcium  adjusted  for  albumin. 
Patient-reported outcomes will be assessed in this study through the EORTC 
QLQ-C30, the FACIT-F, and the EQ-5D scales. Medical resource utilization 
information  will  also  be  collected  throughout  the  study.  Full  plasma 
concentration-time  profiles  will  be  created  for  VELCADE  using  blood 
samples from a subset of approximately 16 subjects in Treatment Group A. 
Pharmacokinetic  evaluations  will  be  performed  at  selected  investigational 
centers;  subjects  who  do  not  consent  to  blood  sample  collection  for 
pharmacokinetic evaluations may still participate in the clinical part of the 
study.  Safety  will  be  evaluated  throughout  the  study  by  assessment  of 
adverse events including selected measures of clinical benefit, and changes 
in  physical 
scores, 
FACT/GOG-Ntx  scores,  vital  signs,  and  clinical  laboratory  findings.  The 
FACT/GOG-Ntx scale will be used as a checklist to assist with the clinical 

examinations,  Karnofsky  performance

safety evaluation of neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy symptoms. 
Protocol-specified  dose  modifications  of  VELCADE,  melphalan,  or 
prednisone  will  be  made,  as  necessary.  Subjects  will  be  evaluated  for 
toxicity before any new dose of study drug is prescribed. Investigators will 
focus  on  hematologic  toxicity  (especially  thrombocytopenia),  on  early 
indications of neuropathy, and on other nonhematologic toxicity. Doses can 
be held or reduced based on the severity of and the recovery from a previous 
toxicity. Dose re-escalations are not allowed for any of the study drugs. 

Three  interim  analyses  are  planned.  The  first  interim  analysis,  for  safety 
monitoring,  will  be  performed  when  approximately  100 subjects  (50 per 
arm)  have  been  on  study  long  enough  to  complete  1 treatment  cycle  (all 
doses  of  melphalan  and  prednisone,  and  at  least  6 of  the  8 doses  of 
VELCADE) or have been terminated early. The second interim analysis is 
planned to re-evaluate the sample size on the basis of accumulated study data 
and  to  monitor  safety  data,  and  will  be  performed  when  approximately 
570 subjects  have  been  enrolled.  The  third  interim  analysis  will  be 
performed  when  approximately  two-thirds  of  the  events  (260 events)  have 
been  observed  or  1 year  has  elapsed  after  the  second  interim  analysis, 
whichever comes first. An independent statistician will perform the interim 
analyses.  An  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)  will  meet 
after  completion  of  each  interim  analysis  to  evaluate  safety  data  and  the 
results of the prospectively-defined interim analysis of efficacy.  

Pharmacogenetic  and  proteomic/metabolomic  exploratory  analyses  are 
planned  on  blood  samples  from  subjects  who  agree  to  participate  in  these 
parts of the study. Subjects can decide only to participate in the clinical part

Based on IDMC recommendations, the Sponsor has decided to unblind the 
study  and  to  analyze  efficacy  and  safety  data  and  to  report  results.  As  a 
consequence  of  the  highly  significant  difference  in  efficacy  endpoints 
observed  between  the  2  treatment  arms  in  favor  of  the  Vc-MP  treatment 
group, as well as a favorable benefit risk ratio for the study, the following 
changes will become effective:

•  The pre-specified statistical boundaries for the primary endpoint TTP and 
the  secondary  endpoints  PFS  and  ORR  have  been  crossed,  no  further 
analyses will be performed.  

•  In line with protocol section 11.5, the subjects in the MP treatment group 

are given the option to crossover to Vc-MP for remaining treatment.  

•  An update of the analysis on OS will be performed when approximately 

174 subjects have died.  

•  Data  collection:  survival  data,  subsequent  therapy  data,  and  safety  data 
(including recovery data) will continue to be collected as specified in the 
protocol; however, collection of other efficacy data and PRO data will be 
terminated as of 01 January 2008.

3.2.  Study Design Rationale 

Study Population 

3.2.1. 
Patients  with  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  require  treatment  if  the 
disease is causing symptoms or organ/tissue damage.38 In newly diagnosed 
patients  less  than  65 years  old,  high-dose  chemotherapy  with  stem  cell 
transplant  has  become 
the  standard  of  care  based  on  significant 
improvements  in  progression-free  survival  and  OS  in  2 large  randomized 
studies  in  this  patient  population.39,40  In  the  current  study,  a  population  of 
patients  who  present  with  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  requiring 
treatment according to the criteria outlined above and who are not candidates 
for high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, will be enrolled. 

Melphalan and Prednisone Dosing Regimen 

3.2.2. 
In this patient population, treatment with MP has been the standard of care 
since the randomized study by Alexanian et al in 1969.25 In the Alexanian 
study,  combination  therapy  with  MP,  given  orally  for  4 consecutive  days 
every  6 weeks,  resulted  in  superior  survival  versus  melphalan  alone. 
Multiple  other  combination  chemotherapy  agents  have  subsequently  been 
tested in randomized studies against MP with no effect on response duration 
or on OS.26 During 35 years of treatment practice with MP, many variations 
on the dosing and scheduling of this regimen have been generated, none of 
which was tested against or proven to be superior to the original regimen. 
Variations  of  the  original  regimen  included  expanding  the  dosing  duration 
from  4  to  7 days,  modifying  the  melphalan  dose  of  0.25 mg/kg  per  day 
(approximately  equivalent  to  9 mg/m2  per  day)  every  6 weeks  to  other 
dosing  regimens  (4  to  8 mg/m2  per  day)  every  4 weeks,  or  modifying  the 
prednisone  dose  or  regimen  (generally  60 mg/m2  per  day,  sometimes 
40 mg/m2 per day or fixed doses of 75 mg per day or 100 mg per day).26,41 In 
this  study,  an  attempt  is  made  to  stay  close  to  the  original  cycle  duration 
(6 weeks) and melphalan dosing (9 mg/m2 per day; approximately equivalent 
to  0.25 mg/kg  per  day)  used  in  the  study  by  Alexanian.25  For  internal 
consistency with VELCADE dosing, all study drug doses will be calculated 
using body surface area (BSA). Therefore a melphalan dose of 9 mg/m2 per 
day will be used, together with the most frequently used steroid regimen of 
prednisone, 60 mg/m2 per day.

Duration of Therapy 

3.2.3. 
Subjects  will  be  treated  until  disease  progression,  with  a  maximum  of 
54 weeks  of  therapy.  While  stopping  MP  in  case  of  progression  is  a 
universally  accepted  practice,  there  is  geographic  heterogeneity  in  the 
optimal duration of therapy of patients who achieve a response or prolonged 
disease  stabilization  as  the  best  outcome  on  therapy.  Patients  are  often 
treated for a fixed time period of 6 months or 12 months or until a response 
plateau  is  reached.42,43  Toxicity  and  burden  of  clinic  visits  in  this  elderly 
patient  population  should  be  weighed  against  the  potential  benefit  of 
prolonged  therapy  and  clear  treatment  duration  guidance  based  on  clinical 
study data is not available. A fixed duration of therapy was chosen for this 
study  to  minimize  the  potential  impact  of  heterogeneity  in  geographic 
treatment  patterns  on  the  time-related  primary  endpoint.  A  12-month 
(54 weeks) duration of therapy was chosen on the basis of: 

•  Historical data from  a large database (Spanish  PETHEMA database) 
on  the  median  duration  of  therapy  with  MP  in  the  population  to  be 
studied (≥65 years of age, previously untreated multiple myeloma with 
no  renal  failure  and  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  [ECOG] 
performance status of 0 to 2). The data from the Spanish PETHEMA 
database  indicate  that  the  average  duration  of  MP  therapy  is 
11 months, which is similar to the 12-month treatment duration chosen 
for this study. 

•  A  randomized,  Phase 3  study  that  showed  maintenance  therapy  with 
MP did not improve survival in subjects who had an initial response to 
this  therapy.27  In  this  study,  responding  subjects  were  randomly 
assigned after a median of 10 months to either maintenance MP until 
relapse or no treatment until relapse, with no survival difference. 

•  Historically, patients who have not developed a response after a fixed 
duration  of  MP  therapy  (“nonresponding  nonprogressive  myeloma”) 
are  extremely  unlikely  to  develop  a  delayed  response  thereafter  and 
should not be continued on chemotherapy until progression occurs.43,44  

VELCADE Dose and Schedule 

3.2.4. 
In the experimental arm of this study, VELCADE will be added to MP for 
the  entire  54 weeks’  duration  of  treatment.  The  duration  of  therapy  is 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

58

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

therefore the same in both arms and was chosen based on standard approach 
to frontline MP use and expert opinion.  

In the first 24 weeks, a VELCADE dose and schedule is used which is active 
and  approved  in  patients  with  pretreated  multiple  myeloma  (1.3 mg/m2 
intravenous twice weekly for 2 weeks out of 3).17,24 It is intercalated into the 
standard MP regimen as 2 VELCADE “cycles” (Weeks 1 and 2 and Weeks 4 
and 5)  within one 6-week MP cycle. This schedule is  given for 24 weeks, 
which is the period of its maximum achievable benefit. On the basis of the 
M34100-025 SUMMIT and the M34100-024 CREST study data, the time to 
best  response  on  VELCADE  occurs  within  24 weeks  with  most  subjects 
achieving best response by 12 weeks. Preliminary results of the M34101-039 
APEX  study  data  are  consistent  with  these  findings,  with  most  subjects 
achieving clinical benefit by 13.5 weeks.  

The optimal duration of VELCADE therapy for all response categories and 
the value of maintenance therapy have not been directly studied. In this trial, 
a less dose-intense weekly regimen of VELCADE (Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 of a 
6-week cycle) is used as maintenance treatment in the last 30 weeks. This is 
based on following considerations:  

•  Weekly  VELCADE  dosing  is  well  tolerated  and  has  a  higher  MTD 
than  twice-weekly  VELCADE.14  This  schedule  was  used  in  the 
M34101-039 APEX study, in which subjects were also switched from 
a  twice-weekly  to  a  weekly  maintenance  regimen  after  a  similar 
24-week period.  

•  The  use  of  weekly  VELCADE  dosing  after  the  intensive  8 cycles 
allows  continued  VELCADE  exposure  for  the  entire  duration  of  the 
standard  MP  therapy.  It  is  expected  that  after  8 cycles,  subjects  will 
have  achieved  maximum  response  to  VELCADE;  therefore  it  is 
reasonable to shift to a less intensive and less toxic weekly VELCADE 
schedule. Since continued exposure to VELCADE may further delay 
progression, it is preferable to continue exposure to the experimental 
drug for the same duration as the treatment on the control arm. 

•  The  weekly  schedule  will  help  to  accommodate  patient  convenience 

and ensure patient compliance during this prolonged therapy.

long-term 

treatment.  In 

•  Safety data of long-term exposure to VELCADE indicates tolerability 
the  M34101-029  extension  study, 
of 
63 subjects  with  multiple  myeloma  were  entered  after  24 weeks  of 
twice-weekly therapy. The mean duration of VELCADE exposure in 
these 63 subjects was 49.4 weeks, with a range from 23 to 99 weeks.  

Primary Endpoint 

3.2.5. 
The primary endpoint of this study is TTP in the intent-to-treat population. 
Time  to  progression  is  a  meaningful  endpoint  in  an  elderly  patient 
population  with  multiple  myeloma  for  whom  currently  available  treatment 
options  are  not  curative  and  can  only  delay  disease  progression.  Overall 
survival was chosen only as a secondary endpoint because of the likelihood 
of  crossover  of  subjects  on  the  control  arm  to  commercially  available 
VELCADE or a VELCADE-containing regimen as subsequent therapy. 

Patient-Reported Outcomes 

3.2.6. 
Patient-reported  outcomes  will  be  measured  by  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30, 
FACIT–F,  and  EuroQOL  EQ-5D.  Patient–reported  outcomes  assessments, 
by  directly  reflecting  the  subject’s  perspective  on  the  disease  and  its 
treatment, are an important part of this trial in evaluating the subject benefits 
of the respective study treatments. 

Because oncology therapies may positively or negatively affect a subject’s 
quality  of  life,  a  common  methodologic  approach  is  used  to  quantify  this 
effect by “quality-adjusting” survival in comparative treatment groups. The 
result, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), is a measure of both the length 
and quality of life and is used as a measure of benefit in cost-utility analysis. 
General PRO instruments such as the EORTC QLQ-C30 are not designed to 
measure  subject  preferences  (or  utilities)  in  a  way  that  is  suitable  for 
calculating QALYs. Therefore, a separate validated instrument, in this case 
the EuroQOL EQ-5D, will be used to quantify utilities to calculate QALYs 
for a cost-utility analysis.45-49

5. 
5.1.  Overview 

RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING 

Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to 
treatment,  to  increase  the  likelihood  that  known  and  unknown  subject 
attributes  (e.g.,  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics)  are  evenly 
balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical 
comparisons across treatment groups.  

5.2.  Procedures 

Subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 allocation to 1 of 2 treatment groups based 
on  a  computer-generated  randomization  schedule  prepared  by  the  sponsor 
before the study. Investigators, study-site personnel, and subjects will not be 
blinded to treatment. Treatment Group A will receive Vc-MP, and Treatment 
Group B  will  receive  MP.  Subjects  will  be  stratified  according  to  baseline 
beta2-microglobulin  (<2.5 mg/L,  2.5  to  5.5 mg/L,  >5.5 mg/L),  baseline 
albumin  (<3.5 g/dL,  ≥3.5 g/dL  [SI  Units:  <35  g/L,  ≥35  g/L]),  and  region 
(North America, Europe, other). Beta2-microglobulin and albumin have been 
identified  as  2 independent  prognostic  factors 
in  untreated  multiple 
myeloma.52,53 

Permuted blocks  central randomization will be implemented in conducting 
this  study.  Subjects  will  be  randomly  assigned  to  1  of  2 treatment  groups 
based  on  an  algorithm  implemented  in  the  Interactive  Voice  Response 
System  (IVRS)  before  the  start  of  the  study.  The  stratified  randomization 
minimizes the imbalance in the distribution of treatment numbers within the 
levels  of  each  individual  stratification  factor:  baseline  beta2-microglobulin, 
baseline albumin, and region (North America, Europe, other). 

The subject identification number is the CRF identification number assigned 
by the site before calling into the IVRS. The treatment code will be assigned 
after phoning into the IVRS. The IVRS will assign a unique treatment code, 
which will dictate the treatment assignment for that subject.  

Unique  vial  numbers  will  be  preprinted  on  the  VELCADE  study  drug 
dispensing  labels  and  assigned  as  subjects  qualify  for  the  study  and  are 
randomly  assigned  to  treatment  by  the  IVRS.  The  study  drug  dispensing 
labels  will  be  2-part,  tear-off  labels  with  directions  for  use  and  other 
information on each part. The tear-off portion of the label can be removed 
64

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

and placed on the reconstituted product for dispensing. The second part of 
the  label  will  remain  affixed  to  the  study  drug  vial  and  will  contain  all 
identifying information. The pharmacist will record appropriate information 
from the vial on the drug dispensing log. 

The sponsor will supply Melphalan and prednisone in bulk for the purpose of 
study  conduct.  The  pharmacist  will  dispense  melphalan  and  prednisone 
according to the procedures in Section 13.2, Packaging. 

Additional information on study drug supplies can be found in Section 13, 
Study Drug Information. 

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 

6. 
6.1.  Dosage of VELCADE, Melphalan, and Prednisone 

Subjects in both treatment groups will be treated for a maximum of 54 weeks 
(nine 6-week cycles). The dosage for both treatments is described below. 

Treatment Group A 
Subjects  will  receive  VELCADE  twice  weekly  (Weeks 1,  2,  4,  and  5)  for 
4 cycles (8 doses per cycle) followed by once weekly (Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5) 
VELCADE for 5 cycles (4 doses per cycle).  

During  Cycles 1  to  4,  subjects  will  receive  VELCADE,  1.3 mg/m2  as  an 
intravenous bolus injection on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 followed 
by  a 10-day rest period  (Days 33 to 42), and oral melphalan 9 mg/m2 and 
oral prednisone 60 mg/m2 once daily on Days 1 to 4, followed by a 38-day

Dose Calculation 

6.1.1. 
The  amount  (in  mg)  of  VELCADE,  melphalan,  and  prednisone  to  be 
administered will be determined by BSA, which will be calculated according 
to  a  standard  nomogram  (Attachment 4).  Body  surface  area  will  be 
calculated on Day 1 of Cycle 1. If a subject experiences a >5% change in 
weight from the weight  used in the most  recent  BSA calculation, then the 
subject’s BSA and dose should be recalculated.  

The  total  calculated  dose  of  VELCADE  may  be  rounded  to  the  nearest 
decimal point (e.g., a calculated dose of 2.47 mg can be rounded to 2.5 mg).

VELCADE Administration 

6.1.2. 
The  pharmacist  will  prepare  VELCADE  under  aseptic  conditions. 
VELCADE is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic 
compounds,  caution  should  be  exercised  when  handling  and  preparing 
VELCADE solution. (Guidelines regarding the proper handling and disposal 
of anticancer agents appear in references 54 to 59.) The pharmacist should 
prepare VELCADE using a vertical laminar flow biological cabinet (hood) 
and proper aseptic techniques. It is recommended that gloves and protective 
garments  be  worn  during  preparation.  Further  instructions  are  provided  in 
Section 13.4, Preparation and Handling. 

VELCADE  will  be  administered  only  to  eligible  subjects  under  the 
supervision of the investigator or identified subinvestigator(s). The dose of 
VELCADE will be 1.3 mg/m2, with the dose reduced or treatment schedule 
modified for the management of study-drug-related toxicities, as described in 
Section 6.2.1,  Cycle  Delay,  Section 6.2.2,  VELCADE  Dose  Modifications 
for  Hematologic  Toxicity,  Section 6.2.4,  VELCADE,  Melphalan,  and 
Prednisone  Dose  Modifications 
for  Nonhematologic  Toxicity  and 
Section 6.2.5,  VELCADE  Dose  Modifications  for  Neuropathic  Pain  or 
Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy.  

The appropriate amount (see Section 6.1.1, Dose Calculation) of VELCADE 
will  be  drawn  from  the  injection  vial  and  administered  as  an  intravenous 
bolus over 3 to 5 seconds followed by a standard saline flush. VELCADE 
can be administered through a peripheral or a central intravenous line. Vials 
are  for  single-use  administration.  There  must  be  at  least  72 hours  between 
VELCADE doses. The subject should be considered clinically stable by the 
investigator before discharge. 

Melphalan and Prednisone Administration 

6.1.3. 
The  dose  of  melphalan  will  be  9 mg/m2  and  that  of  prednisone  will  be 
60 mg/m2. Melphalan and prednisone doses may be reduced or the treatment 
schedule  may  be  modified  for  the  management  of  study-drug-related 
toxicities,  as  described  in  Section 6.2.1,  Cycle  Delay,  Section 6.2.3, 
Melphalan Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity, and Section 6.2.4, 
VELCADE,  Melphalan,  and  Prednisone  Dose  Modifications 
for 
Nonhematologic Toxicities. Melphalan and prednisone will be administered 
orally. 

FINAL – 7 February 2008

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

On Day 4 of each cycle, the site will contact the subject to verify compliance 
with drug dosing, and to remind the subject to stop taking any further dose of 
melphalan or prednisone. If prednisone and melphalan have been dispensed 
to  subjects  in  individual  dose  containers,  this  contact  on  Day 4  is  not 
mandatory. 

In  exceptional  circumstances,  a  subject  may  not  tolerate  sudden  steroid 
withdrawal at the end of 4 days of prednisone therapy. In such an instance, a 
tapering  regimen  of  prednisone  (30 mg/m2  on  Day  5,  20 mg/m2  on  Day 6, 
10 mg/m2 on Day 7, then stop) can be prescribed to the subject after sponsor 
approval.  Under  no  circumstances  will  the  melphalan  administration  be 
prolonged beyond 4 days.

is  strongly 
Breaking  or  dividing  melphalan  or  prednisone 
discouraged; the total calculated dose should be rounded to the closest dose 
that  can  be  administered  using  the  study  drug  supplied  (see  Section 13.1, 
Physical  Description  of  Study  Drugs).  Subjects  will  be  instructed  to  take 
melphalan tablets on Day 1 of each cycle at least 2 hours before or after a 
meal, and in the morning under fasting conditions on other dosing days; and 
to  take  prednisone  tablets  with  or  immediately  after  a  meal  or  snack, 
preferably in the morning.  

6.2.  Dose Modification and Delay 

On  the  first  day  of  each  new  cycle  and  before  each  VELCADE  dose,  the 
subject will be evaluated for possible drug toxicities that may have occurred 
since  the  previous  dose(s).  All  previously  established  or  new  toxicities 
observed  at  any  time  are  to  be  managed  as  described  in  the  following 
sections.  

Two  dose  level  reductions  are  permitted  for  VELCADE  (1.3 mg/m2  to 
1 mg/m2 and 1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2). Two dose reductions are permitted for 
melphalan  (9 mg/m2  to  6.75 mg/m2  and  6.75 mg/m2  to  4.5 mg/m2)  and 
prednisone (60 mg/m2 to 45 mg/m2 and 45 mg/m2 to 30 mg/m2). Subsequent 
reductions can only occur if there is clear clinical benefit observed and after 
approval  by  the  sponsor.  Otherwise,  subjects  who  have  an  unacceptable 
toxicity  after  2 dose  reductions  due  to  toxicity  from  any  1  of  the  3 study 
drugs will discontinue that study drug.  

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

68

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

If  only  1 component  of  the  doublet  combination  MP,  or  only  1  or 
2 components  of  the  triplet  combination  Vc-MP,  is  discontinued  due  to 
toxicity, subjects can continue to be treated with the other component(s) of 
the combination, as long as the criteria for discontinuation of treatment  as 
presented in Section 10.2, Discontinuation of Treatment, are not met. 

Cycle Delay 

6.2.1. 
The start of a NEW cycle can be delayed on a weekly basis (for a maximum 
of  3 weeks)  until  recovery  of  toxicity  to  a  level  allowing  continuation  of 
therapy. Delay of a new cycle for more than 3 weeks can only occur if there 
is  clear  clinical  benefit  observed  and  after  approval  by  the  sponsor. 
Otherwise, if there is a delay in the start of a new cycle of more than 3 weeks 
due  to  insufficient  recovery  from  toxicity,  subjects  will  discontinue  study 
drug  and  have  procedures  performed  as  outlined 
in  Section 10.2, 
Discontinuation  of  Treatment.  For  Treatment  Group A,  if  a  subject  has  a 
VELCADE-related  neurotoxicity,  then  only  the  VELCADE  dose  will  be 
held (or adjusted) as described in the table in Section 6.2.5, VELCADE Dose 
Modifications  for  Neuropathic  Pain  or  Peripheral  Sensory  Neuropathy. 
These subjects may start the new cycle with MP as planned.  

Doses of study drug that need to be held WITHIN a cycle are skipped and 
will not be made up later in the cycle. 

The following parameters must be met on the first day of a new cycle (other 
than Cycle 1): 

–  Platelet count ≥70 x 109/L  
–  Hemoglobin  ≥8 g/dL  (≥4.96 mmol/L)  (prior  RBC  transfusion  or 

recombinant human erythropoietin use is allowed) 

–  ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L  
–  Nonhematologic  toxicity  must  have  recovered  to  Grade 1  or 

baseline 

If the above parameters are not met, the start of the next cycle will be held 
for a week (with a maximum of 3 weeks) for recovery to the specified levels.  

Cycle delays or study drug discontinuation are not required for lymphopenia 
of any grade.

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

6.2.2. 

VELCADE Dose Modifications for Hematologic 
Toxicity 

If in the previous cycle, 3 or more of the 8 doses of VELCADE (for Cycles 1 
to  4)  or  2  or  more  of  the  4 doses  of  VELCADE  (for  Cycles  5  to  9)  were 
skipped due to hematologic toxicity, the dose of VELCADE will be reduced 
in  the  following  cycles  from  1.3 mg/m2  to  1 mg/m2,  or  from  1 mg/m2  to 
0.7 mg/m2.  

On any day of VELCADE administration during a cycle, other than Day 1 of 
each cycle, the hematology results must be:  

–  Platelet count ≥30 × 109/L 
–  Hemoglobin  ≥8g/dL  (≥4.96 mmol/L)  (prior  RBC  transfusion  or 

recombinant human erythropoietin use is allowed) 

–  ANC ≥0.75 x 109/L  

If the above parameters are not met, the VELCADE dose will be skipped; 
the dose will not be made up later in the cycle.  

Dose (re-)escalations of VELCADE are not allowed. 

6.2.3. 

Melphalan Dose Modifications for Hematologic 
Toxicity 

Neutropenia 
If  Grade 4  neutropenia  with  duration  of  5 days  or  more  is  observed,  the 
melphalan dose will be reduced by 25% (9 mg/m2 to 6.75 mg/m2) in the next 
cycle. The start of the next cycle will be held until recovery of toxicity to a 
level  allowing  continuation  of  therapy  (see  Section 6.2.1,  Cycle  Delay). 
Alternatively,  the  current  dose  of  melphalan  can  be  continued  if  colony 
stimulating factors (such as G-CSF or GM-CSF) support is provided. 

If  Grade 4  neutropenia  with  duration  of  5 days  or  more  recurs,  then  an 
(additional) 25% reduction in the melphalan dose is indicated. Alternatively, 
if  prophylactic  treatment  with  colony  stimulating  factors  has  not  been 
started, this may be instituted instead of a further dose reduction. 

Thrombocytopenia  
If  thrombocytopenia  (with  a  platelet  count  <25 × 109/L;  confirmed  on 
2 measurements at least 5 days apart) is observed, the melphalan dose will be

6.2.4. 

VELCADE, Melphalan, and Prednisone Dose 
Modifications for Nonhematologic Toxicity 

If  a  subject  experiences  any  Grade 3  or  Grade 4  nonhematologic  toxicity 
considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug(s),  then  Vc-MP 
will be held until the toxicity returns to Grade 1 or baseline. After recovery 
of the toxicity to a level allowing continuation of therapy, a dose reduction 
should  be  instituted  for  both  VELCADE  and  melphalan  unless,  in  the 
investigator’s opinion, only 1 of the drugs was responsible for the toxicity. A 
dose  reduction  for  prednisone  should  occur  only  for  Grade 3  or  Grade 4 
corticosteroid toxicities. 

If neurotoxicity is clearly  related to VELCADE, then only the VELCADE 
needs to be dose adjusted. 

If a subject experiences a Grade 3 or Grade 4 nondrug-related renal function 
impairment  or  hepatic  function  impairment,  VELCADE,  melphalan,  and 
prednisone  are  to  be  held  until  recovery  to  Grade  1  or  baseline.  Upon 
recovery of the toxicity to a level allowing continuation of therapy, a dose 
reduction is not necessary. 

However,  if  a  subject  develops  renal  function  impairment  with  a  serum 
creatinine >2 mg/dL (>176.8 mcmol/L) but less than Grade 3, the melphalan 
dose must be reduced to 4.5 mg/m2, while VELCADE and prednisone can be 
continued  at  the  current  dose.  On  recovery  of  renal  function  to  serum 
creatinine ≤2 mg/dL, the melphalan can be re-escalated to the previous dose. 

6.2.5. 

VELCADE Dose Modifications for Neuropathic Pain 
or Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy 

Subjects who experience neuropathic pain or peripheral sensory neuropathy 
considered by the investigator to be VELCADE related are to be managed as

questionnaire 
FACT/GOG-Ntx (see Attachment 5) is provided as a safety checklist to help 
determine  the  presence  and  intensity  of  neuropathic  pain  or  peripheral 
neuropathy using the subjects’ reports.60 The FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire 
should be completed by all subjects at the Screening Visit, before dosing on 
Day 1 of each cycle, and at the End-of-Treatment Visit and be reviewed by 
the  study  staff  to  assist  with  the  evaluation  of  the  onset  and  intensity  of 
peripheral  neuropathy  and  other  neurotoxicities  that  may  possibly  require 
intervention  or  dose  modification.  See  Section 9.7,  Safety  Evaluations,  for 
additional information on the FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire.  

6.3.  Cross-over * 

7. 

As a consequence of the outcome of the third interim analysis, and in line 
with protocol section 11.5, the subjects in the MP treatment group who are 
still receiving treatment are given the option to cross-over to Vc-MP for the 
remainder of their treatment period. 

COMPLIANCE 
The dose of VELCADE, melphalan, and prednisone to be administered will 
be  calculated  using  BSA  as  described  in  Section 6.1.1,  Dose  Calculation. 
The dose of each study drug to be administered will be documented in the 
source document on Day 1 of each cycle. On each day of treatment, the dose 
administered  and  date  of  administration  will  also  be  documented  in  the 
source document and case report form (CRF). 

                                                           

*     This section of the protocol has been revised. Please refer to the section of this document entitled 
PROTOCOL  AMENDMENTS  (Amendment INT-5,  12  February  2008)  for  a  detailed 
description of the specific changes 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

73

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

Subjects will be given a study drug diary to record the date of administration 
of each dose of melphalan and prednisone. Subject study drug diaries will be 
reviewed and reconciled by the monitor. 

CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
8. 
8.1.  Bisphosphonates Therapy 

Bisphosphonates will be administered to all subjects with evidence of lytic 
destruction of bone or with osteopenia, according to the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines, unless specifically 
contraindicated.61  If  bisphosphonate  therapy  was  not  started  prior  to  the 
study,  it  should  be  initiated  within  1 week  after  the  start  of  study  drug. 
Bisphosphonate  therapy  is  to  be  continued  throughout  the  Open-label 
Treatment and Posttreatment Phases until disease progression is established. 
Commercially  available  intravenous  bisphosphonates  (pamidronate  and 
zoledronic acid) are preferred when available, and should be used according 
to  the  manufacturer’s  recommendations,  as  described  in  the  prescribing 
information  for  subjects  with  osteolytic  or  osteopenic  myelomatous  bone 
disease.  Oral  bisphosphonates  may  be  used  as  alternatives  if  intravenous 
bisphosphonates  are  not  available  at  the  investigator  site.  Investigators 
should use the same route of bisphosphonate therapy for all subjects at their 
sites. 

8.2.  Therapy for Tumor Lysis Syndrome 

For subjects at risk for tumor lysis syndrome, allopurinol treatment should be 
considered and special attention should be given to adequate hydration. 

8.3.  Permitted Therapies 

Subjects  may  receive  full  supportive  care.  The  following  medications  and 
supportive  therapies  are  examples  of  support  therapies  that  may  be  used 
during the study: 

•  Colony  stimulating  factors,  erythropoietin,  and  transfusion  of  platelets 

and red cells. Recommendations for use are provided in Attachment 6. 

•  Loperamide is recommended for the treatment of diarrhea, starting at the 
time  of  the  first  watery  stool.  The  loperamide  dose  and  regimen  is 
according  to  institutional  guidelines.  Prophylactic  loperamide  is  not 
recommended. 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

74

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

•  It is important to prevent constipation (e.g., adequate hydration, high-fiber 

diet, and stool softeners if needed). 

•  Prophylactic antiemetics are not routinely recommended but are left to the 
investigator’s  discretion.  Systemic  corticosteroids  cannot  be  used  in  the 
prophylaxis or therapy of emesis. 

•  Adequate  hydration  is  recommended  for  prevention  of  myeloma-related 

kidney disease.  

•  For  subjects  in  Treatment  Group A  (Vc-MP),  prophylaxis  for  herpes 
zoster  reactivation  is  recommended  during  the  open-label,  treatment 
phase. Acceptable antiviral therapy includes acyclovir (e.g., 400 mg given 
orally,  3 times  a  day),  famcyclovir  (e.g.,  125 mg  given  orally,  twice  a 
day), or valacyclovir (e.g., 500 mg given orally, twice a day). 

8.4.  Excluded Therapies 

Concomitant  administration  of  any  other  antineoplastic  therapy,  with  the 
exception of emergency orthopedic surgery or emergency local radiotherapy, 
is  prohibited.  Continuation  of  study  drug  during  or  after  the  emergency 
orthopedic surgery or radiotherapy because of subject benefit can only occur 
in  the  absence  of  disease  progression  and  after  consultation  with  and 
approval  by  the  sponsor.  Such  emergency  radiotherapy  may  consist  of 
localized  radiotherapy  for  pain  control  or  for  stabilization  of  an  extensive 
bone  lesion  at  high  risk  of  pathologic  fracture  or  damage  to  surrounding 
tissues  in  a  subject  in  whom  delay  of  systemic  therapy  is  not  appropriate. 
Such radiotherapy is to occur within the first 2 cycles of treatment and the 
absence of evidence of disease progression is to be reviewed and approved 
by the sponsor. 

Administration  of  investigational  agents  is  prohibited  during  the  study. 
Administration  of  commercially  available  agents  with  activity  against  or 
under investigation for multiple myeloma, including systemic corticosteroids 
(>10 mg prednisone per day or equivalent – with the exception of study drug 
given  on  Day 1  to  4  of  each  cycle),  clarithromycin,  and  thalidomide  is 
prohibited during the study. 

Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents  should  be  avoided  to  prevent 
myeloma-related  kidney  disease.  Generally,  intravenous  contrast  is  NOT 
used in CT-scanning of patients with secretory multiple myeloma because of 
the risk to the kidney; if administration of intravenous contrast is necessary, 
adequate precautions including hydration are indicated. 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

75

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

The sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter) of 
any instances in which prohibited therapies are planned or administered. 

8.5.  Recording of Concomitant Medications  

The  use  of  concomitant  medications  or  therapies  whether  continued  from 
before the start of study or started during the study until 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug should be documented in the appropriate section of the 
CRF. 

The  use  of  bisphosphonates  (whether  continued  from  before  the  start  of 
study or started during the study) until development of progressive disease 
(PD) should be documented in the appropriate section of the CRF. 

8.6.  Subsequent Therapies 

Administration  of  any  other  antineoplastic  therapy  after  completion  of 
54 weeks  of  study  drug  administration 
(including  maintenance  or 
consolidation therapy) is not allowed until PD is established according to the 
criteria  as  described  in  the  disease  response  criteria  in  Section 9.3.7, 
Assessment of Progressive Disease and Disease Response. 

Administration  of  any  other  antineoplastic  therapy  to  subjects  who 
discontinue  study  drug  before  completion  of  54 weeks  of  study  drug 
administration for reasons other than PD, is strongly discouraged until PD is 
established. 

After  PD  is  established,  subsequent  therapy  is  left  to  the  investigator’s 
discretion.  Subjects  on  the  Vc-MP  arm  who  relapse  after  a  sustained 
response after completion of study treatment will have access to VELCADE 
through existing programs outside of this protocol. 

Subsequent therapy for multiple myeloma (including start and end date and 
best response) should be documented in the appropriate section of the CRF.

The total blood drawn for scheduled laboratory evaluations during the first 
year  after  initiation  of  treatment  (including  the  Screening  Phase,  54-week 
Open-Label,  Treatment  Phase,  and  End-of-Treatment  evaluations)  will  be 
approximately  626 mL  for  Treatment  Group A  and  approximately  562 mL 
for  Treatment  Group B.  During  the  Posttreatment  Phase,  approximately 
60 mL  of  blood  per  year  will  be  drawn  from  subjects  in  both  treatment 
groups.  In  the  subset  of  subjects  who  participate  in  pharmacokinetic 
evaluations, approximately an additional 50 mL of blood will be collected. 
Additional  blood  samples  will  be  collected  from  subjects  who  consent  to 
participate in the pharmacogenetic (10 mL) and proteomic (20 mL) parts of 
the study.  

Prerandomization (Screening) Phase 

9.1.2. 
Subjects will be screened for eligibility during the Prerandomization Phase. 
Refer to the Time and Events Schedule in the Synopsis for a complete list of 
procedures to be performed during the Screening Phase. 

Randomization of eligible subjects should occur within 14 days after signing 
the  informed  consent.  Informed  consent  must  be  obtained  before  any 
study-specific  assessments  are  performed.  However,  results  of  tests  (i.e., 
skeletal  survey,  radiologic  tests  [e.g.,  MRI]  to  document  baseline  size  of 
known  or  suspected  extramedullary  plasmacytomas,  electrocardiogram, 
posteroanterior  and  lateral  chest  X-rays,  or  bone  marrow  collection  for 
morphology  and  cytogenetics)  obtained  prior  to  signing  of  the  informed 
consent as part of the subject’s standard care can be used for this study  if 
performed within 21 days before randomization.  

At selected investigational centers, approximately 16 subjects will be asked 
to consent to collection of blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations as 
described  in  Section 9.2,  Pharmacokinetic  Evaluations.  If  subjects  do  not 
consent  to  this  blood  sample  collection,  they  may  still  participate  in  the 
clinical part of the study.  

As  part  of  this  study,  subjects  may  consent  to  optional  blood  sample 
collections for pharmacogenomics and proteomics analyses as described in 
Section 9.5.2, Pharmacogenetic Blood Sample Collection, and Section 9.6.2, 
Proteomic Blood Sample Collection. Subjects can decide only to participate

in the clinical part of the study or to participate in the entire study including 
the pharmacogenomics and proteomics parts.  

Open-Label Treatment Phase * 

9.1.3. 
The Open-label, Treatment Phase begins on Day 1 of Cycle 1 of treatment 
with  study  drug  and  continues  until  completion  of  study  therapy  or 
discontinuation  of  all  study  drugs.  Subjects  who  are  randomly  assigned 
should start therapy either the day of or within 72 hours after randomization. 

Refer to the Time and Events Schedule in the Synopsis for a complete list of 
procedures to be performed during the Open-label, Treatment Phase. 

Subjects will be evaluated throughout this phase for possible toxicities, and 
delays in dosing or dose modifications will be made as required according to 
the  criteria  in  Section 6.2,  Dose  Modification  and  Delay.  Subjects  who 
discontinue study drugs because of drug toxicity will have end-of-treatment 
procedures completed and enter the Posttreatment Phase. 

Throughout  the  Open-label,  Treatment  Phase,  the  investigator  will  assess 
subject  response  to  therapy  using  efficacy  measurements  and  disease 
response  criteria  described  in  Section 9.3,  Efficacy  Evaluations.  Efficacy 
evaluations may be repeated more frequently than every 3 weeks if clinically 
indicated.  

If  PD  is  established  during  this  phase,  the  subject  will  discontinue  study 
drugs,  have  end-of-treatment  procedures  completed,  and  enter 
the 
Posttreatment Phase.  

After the third interim analysis and as of 01 January 2008, the investigator 
will no longer be required to assess and report subject response to therapy 
using  efficacy  measurements  and  disease  response  criteria  as  described  in 
Section 9.3. The subjects’ disease status may be further followed as per the 
local institution guidelines.

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

End-of-Treatment Visit 
This  visit  is  performed  30  to  42 days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug  to 
perform  end-of-treatment  procedures  and  to  monitor  subjects  for  adverse 
events that occur within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Additional 
information on reporting of adverse events can be found in Section 12.2.1, 
All Adverse Events. 

Refer to the Time and Events Schedule in the Synopsis for a complete list of 
procedures to be performed at the End-of-Treatment Visit.  

Posttreatment Phase (Follow Up)  

9.1.4. 
After  completion  of  study  therapy  or  discontinuation  of  all  study  drug, 
subjects will be followed until death or a maximum of 4.5 years after the last 
subject  is  randomly  assigned  in  the  study.  Refer  to  the  Time  and  Events 
Schedule in the Synopsis for a complete list of assessments to be performed 
at Posttreatment Follow-up Visits. 

For  subjects  who  discontinue  study  drug  before  disease  progression  and 
before completion of the 54 weeks of treatment in the Open-label, Treatment 
Phase,  posttreatment  assessments  should  continue  to  be  performed  every 
3 weeks  (serum  quantitative  immunoglobulins,  serum  and  24-hour  urine 
M-protein  assessments,  and  serum  calcium  corrected  for  albumin  every 
3 weeks and radiology for extramedullary plasmacytomas and completion of 
PRO questionnaires every 6 weeks) for the remainder of the 54 weeks after 
the date of randomization, then every 8 weeks thereafter. For subjects who 
complete  the  54 weeks  of  treatment  in  the  Open-label,  Treatment  Phase 
before  disease  progression,  posttreatment  visits  will  be  performed  every 
8 weeks.  

After disease progression is documented, subsequent treatment and survival 
status  will  be  documented  at  least  every  12 weeks.  Evidence  of  clinical 
relapse, according to IMWG criteria,1 will also be documented at the time at 
which  it  is  first  detected.  If  the  information  on  subsequent  treatment  and 
survival status is obtained without having the subject visit the study center, 
written documentation of the communication must be available for review in 
the source documents.

Subsequent therapy for multiple myeloma (including start and end date and 
best response) will be documented during the entire Posttreatment Phase. 

9.2.  Pharmacokinetic Evaluations  

Pharmacokinetic evaluations will be performed on plasma samples collected 
from approximately 16 subjects in Treatment Group A, enrolled at selected 
investigational centers, who are willing to participate in the pharmacokinetic 
sampling.  A  subject  will  be  considered  as  having  completed 
the 
pharmacokinetic  assessment  if  he/she  has  completed  all  of  the  sampling 
through the 24-hour sample collection on Day 25 of Cycle 1 and Day 4 of 
Cycle 2. Subjects who do not complete the pharmacokinetic assessment will 
be replaced so that full profiles from 16 subjects are obtained.

Sample Collection and Handling 

9.2.1. 
Venous  blood 
for  determination  of  plasma  VELCADE 
concentration will be obtained by direct venipuncture from a peripheral vein 
or collected from an indwelling catheter.  If an indwelling catheter is used, 
approximately  0.5 mL  of  blood  will  be  removed  and  discarded  before 
obtaining the blood sample for pharmacokinetic analysis. Blood samples for 
pharmacokinetic sampling should be collected from the arm contralateral to 
that  of  VELCADE  administration  (i.e.,  opposite  arms  should  be  used  for 
pharmacokinetic sampling and VELCADE administration). 

On Day 25 of Cycle 1 and Day 4 of Cycle 2, blood samples will be collected 
immediately before dosing (predose), and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 
4, 6, 10, and 24 hours after VELCADE administration. The exact dates and 
times of the collection of blood samples and the preceding VELCADE dose 
will be recorded on the CRF. Study personnel will confirm that melphalan 
and prednisone were taken on Days 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Cycle 2 and record this 
confirmation on the CRF.  

Blood samples will be placed into a collection tube containing EDTA. For 
measurement  of  VELCADE  plasma  concentrations,  4 mL  of  the  blood 
sample will be centrifuged to separate the plasma. The plasma will be placed 
in an appropriately labeled polyethylene screw-cap tube and stored at –80°C 
or lower until shipment.

Refer to Attachments 7, 8, and 9 for further information regarding handling 
of biological samples. 

Analytical Procedures 

9.2.2. 
Concentrations of VELCADE in plasma will be determined using a validated 
liquid  chromatography  coupled  to  mass  spectrometry/mass  spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS)  method.  A  description  of  the  assay  validation  data  will  be 
included in the final report, as an addendum.  

Pharmacokinetic Parameters  

9.2.3. 
Full plasma concentration-time profiles of VELCADE will be obtained from 
16 subjects in Treatment Group A.  

The plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of VELCADE will be calculated by 
noncompartmental analysis of the plasma concentration-time data. Individual 
actual blood sampling times relative to trial medication intake will used. The 
following  plasma  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  VELCADE  will  be 
estimated: 

C0:   Predose plasma concentration at Time 0 (C0), taken directly from the 

plasma concentration-time profile 

Cmax: Observed  maximum  plasma  concentration,  taken  directly  from  the 

plasma concentration-time profile 

tmax:  Time  when  Cmax  is  observed,  taken  directly  from  the  plasma 

concentration-time profile 

AUC24h:  Area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  from  time  0  to 
linear 

24 hours  after  VELCADE  administration,  calculated  by 
trapezoidal summation 

9.3.  Efficacy Evaluations  

The  following  section  describes  the  efficacy  measurements  that  will  be 
obtained during the study. A description of primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints can be found in the Section 9.4, Efficacy Criteria.  

Screening  evaluations  are

plasmacytomas, electrocardiogram, postero-anterior and lateral chest X-rays, 
or  bone  marrow  collection  for  morphology  and  cytogenetics  that  were 
obtained  prior  to  signing  of  the  informed  consent  as  part  of  the  subject’s 
standard care can be used for this study if performed within 21 days before 
randomization. 

All  efficacy  measurements  collected  on  the  same  day  as  study  drug 
administration must be collected before study drug is administered. 

9.3.1. 
Myeloma Protein Measurements in Serum and Urine 
Blood  samples  for  quantitation  of  immunoglobulins  and  M-protein  (serum 
protein  electrophoresis 
[SPEP])  and  assessment  of  M-protein  by 
immunofixation  in  serum  are  to  be  collected  from  all  subjects  during  the 
Screening Phase.  

Twenty-four hour urine samples for quantitation of M-protein (urine protein 
electrophoresis [UPEP]) and assessment of M-protein by immunofixation are 
to be collected from all subjects during the Screening Phase.  

Subjects  with  immunofixation-negative  (in  both  serum  and  24-hour  urine) 
nonsecretory  multiple  myeloma  are  only  required  to  provide  a  blood  and 
24-hour urine sample in the Screening Phase. 

For  subjects  with  secretory  multiple  myeloma,  blood  and  24-hour  urine 
samples  will  be  collected  every  3 weeks  (at  approximately  Day  1  and 
Day 22  of  each  6-week  cycle)  for  the  54 weeks  after  the  date  of 
randomization;  at  the  End-of-Treatment  Visit;  and  every  8 weeks  at 
posttreatment follow-up visits after the first 54 weeks until the development 
of confirmed PD. If blood and 24-hour urine samples collected at screening 
were taken within 14 days before Cycle 1, Day 1, then it is not mandatory to 
collect  these  samples  again  at  the  Cycle 1,  Day 1  visit.  For  subjects  who 
discontinue study drug before disease progression and before completion of 
the 54 weeks of treatment in the Open-label, Treatment Phase, posttreatment 
assessments  should  continue  every  3 weeks  for  the  remainder  of  the 
54 weeks after the date of randomization and then every 8 weeks thereafter 
until development of confirmed PD. 

If  the  assessment  of  PD  is  based  on  1 of  these  tests,  then  confirmation  is 
required by a second measurement performed 1 to 3 weeks later.  

FINAL – 7 February 2008

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

The central laboratory will perform the immunofixation test at screening to 
identify  the  isotype  and  during  treatment  when  a  CR  is  suspected  (when 
serum or 24-hour urine M-protein electrophoresis [by SPEP or UPEP] are 
0 or nonquantifiable).  

Blood and 24-hour urine samples for M-protein measurements will be sent to 
and  analyzed  by  a  central  laboratory.  Only  one  serum  AND  one  24-hour 
urine sample per time point are required by the central laboratory to perform 
the following tests:  

–  serum immunoglobulin quantitation and M-protein quantitation by 

electrophoresis (SPEP)  

–  quantitation of 24-hour urine M-protein by electrophoresis (UPEP)  
–  serum immunofixation 
–  urine immunofixation 

All attempts should be made to determine eligibility of the subject based on 
the  central  laboratory  results  of  screening  blood  and  urine  M-protein 
measurements.  In  exceptional  circumstances  the  local  laboratory  results  of 
blood  and  urine  M-protein  measurements  can  be  used  to  determine 
eligibility, but only if the results are clearly (e.g., 25% or more) above the 
thresholds for measurability as indicated in Section 4.2, Inclusion Criteria. 

Bone Marrow Examination 

9.3.2. 
Bone  marrow  aspiration  and  biopsy  are  to  be  performed  for  all  subjects 
during  the  Screening  Phase,  and  for  any  subject  who  achieves  a  CR 
(immunofixation  negative)  to  treatment.  Only  1 bone  marrow  examination 
(i.e.,  a  bone  marrow  aspiration  and  biopsy)  is  necessary  for  subjects  with 
secretory  myeloma  with  a  CR  (immunofixation  negative)  for  complete 
documentation of this CR. However, 2 bone marrow examinations (1 plus a 
confirmatory bone marrow examination after at least 6 weeks) are required 
to confirm CR for subjects with nonsecretory and oligosecretory myeloma. 

During the Screening Phase, 2 bone marrow samples are to be collected for 
evaluation  by  the  local  laboratory,  one  for  morphology  and  one  for 
cytogenetics. For repeat samples, only 1 bone marrow sample is required for 
morphology evaluation.

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

Skeletal Survey and Radiographs 

9.3.3. 
A  complete  bone  survey,  to  include  skull,  entire  vertebral  column,  pelvis, 
chest,  humeri,  femora,  and  any  other  bones  for  which  the  investigator 
suspects  involvement  by  disease,  is  to  be  performed  by  roentgenography 
during the Screening Phase. At other time points, skeletal surveys should be 
performed if indicated based on symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging is 
an acceptable method for evaluation of bone disease and can be included at 
the  discretion  of  the  investigator,  however  it  does  not  replace  the  skeletal 
survey  (see  the  disease  response  criteria  in  Section 9.3.7,  Assessment  of 
Progressive  Disease  and  Disease  Response).  The  chest  radiograph  that  is 
required at screening is a separate examination from the skeletal survey. 

To document the response assessments of CR, PR, or MR, there should not 
be  any  increase  in  the  size  or  number  of  lytic  bone  lesions,  if  bone 
radiographs  are  performed.  In  any  case,  there  should  be  no  symptoms 
suggesting increasing bone disease. 

Sometimes subjects present with PD manifested by symptoms of pain due to 
bone changes. Therefore, PD may be documented, in these cases, by skeletal 
survey  or  other  radiographs,  depending  on  the  symptoms  that  the  subject 
experiences. If the diagnosis of PD is obvious by radiographic investigations, 
no  repeat  confirmatory  X-rays  are  necessary.  In  instances  where  changes 
may be more subtle, a repeat X-ray may be needed in 1 to 3 weeks. 

Documentation of Extramedullary Plasmacytomas  

9.3.4. 
Sites  of  known  myelomatous  disease,  especially  in  extramedullary  areas, 
must  be  documented  during  the  Screening  Phase.  Clinical  examination  or 
MRI  may  be  used  to  document  extramedullary  sites  of  disease.  CT  scan 
evaluations are an acceptable alternative if there is no contraindication to the 
use  of  intravenous  contrast.  Positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  scan  or 
ultrasound  tests  are  not acceptable  to  document  the  size  of  extramedullary 
plasmacytomas.  

For  subjects  with  nonsecretory  myeloma,  who  will  not  have  serum  or 
24-hour urine samples collected for myeloma protein measurements, other 
measurable  disease  must  be  present  and  assessed,  preferentially  by 
radiographic  techniques,  such  as  CT  scan  or  MRI.  Superficial  lesions  can 
also be assessed by physical examination.  

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

84

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

For  subjects  with  secretory  or  oligosecretory  myeloma,  known  sites  of 
myelomatous disease must be documented at baseline through radiographic 
or clinical examination.  

Radiologic or clinical assessment of measurable sites of disease for subjects 
with nonsecretory, secretory, or oligosecretory myeloma will be performed 
every 6 weeks (Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 9) for the 54 weeks after the date of 
randomization,  at  the  End-of-Treatment  Visit,  and  every  8  weeks  at 
posttreatment follow-up visits after the first 54 weeks until development of 
confirmed  PD.  For  subjects  who  discontinue  study  drug  before  disease 
progression  and  before  completion  of  the  54 weeks  of  treatment  in  the 
Open-label  Treatment  Phase,  posttreatment  assessments  should  continue 
every  6 weeks  for  the  remainder  of  the  54 weeks  after  the  date  of 
randomization  and  then  every  8 weeks  thereafter  until  development  of 
confirmed PD. 

For every subject, the methodology used for evaluation of each disease site 
should  be  consistent  across  all  visits.  Irradiated  or  excised  lesions  will  be 
considered  not  measurable  and  will  be  monitored  only  for  disease 
progression. 

To qualify for PR or MR, the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of 
the  existing  plasmacytomas  must  have  decreased  by  at  least  50%  or  25%, 
respectively,  and  new  plasmacytomas  must  not  have  developed  (see  the 
disease response criteria in Section 9.3.7, Assessment of Progressive Disease 
and  Disease  Response).  To  qualify  for  PD,  either  the  sum  of  products  of 
perpendicular diameters of the existing plasmacytomas must have increased 
by at least 50% or a new plasmacytoma must have developed.  In the case 
where not all existing plasmacytomas are reported, but the sum of products 
of the perpendicular diameters of the reported plasmacytomas have increased 
by at least 50%, this will also qualify for PD. 

Serum Calcium Corrected for Albumin 

9.3.5. 
Blood samples for calculating serum calcium corrected for albumin will be 
collected at screening, every 3 weeks (at approximately Day 1 and Day 22 of 
each 6-week cycle) for the 54 weeks after the date of randomization; at the 
End-of-Treatment Visit; and every 8 weeks at posttreatment follow-up visits 
after the first 54 weeks until the development of confirmed PD. For subjects 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

85

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

who  discontinue  study  drug  before  disease  progression  and  before 
completion of the 54 weeks of treatment in the Open-label, Treatment Phase, 
posttreatment assessments should continue every 3 weeks for the remainder 
of  the  54 weeks  after  the  date  of  randomization  and  then  every  8 weeks 
thereafter until development of confirmed PD. 

Development  of  hypercalcemia  (corrected  serum  calcium  >11.5 mg/dL  or 
2.8 mmol/L) can indicate disease progression/relapse if it is not attributable 
to any other cause (see disease response criteria in Section 9.3.7, Assessment 
of Progressive Disease and Disease Response).  

Because  calcium  binds  to  albumin  and  only  the  unbound  (free)  calcium  is 
biologically active, the serum calcium level must be adjusted for abnormal 
albumin levels (“corrected serum calcium”). The formula62 for adjustment is 
given below. 

If calcium is expressed in mg/dL and albumin is expressed in g/dL: 

Corrected calcium (mg/dL) =  

 

serum calcium (mg/dL) + 0.98•(4 - serum albumin [g/dL]) 

If calcium is expressed in mmol/L and albumin is expressed in g/L: 

Corrected calcium (mmol/L) =  

 

serum calcium (mmol/L) + 0.0246•(40 – serum albumin [g/L])  

Measurement  of  free  ionized  calcium  is  an  acceptable  alternative  to 
corrected  serum  calcium  for  determination  of  hypercalcemia.  Free  ionized 
calcium  levels  greater  than  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (local  laboratory 
reference ranges) are considered to be hypercalcemic for this study.  

Beta2-microglobulin and Albumin 

9.3.6. 
Blood samples for beta2-microglobulin and albumin are to be collected in the 
Screening Phase and will be analyzed by the central laboratory. Subjects will 
be  randomly  assigned  on  the  basis  of  the  results  submitted  by  the  central 
laboratory.  The  local  laboratory  will  also  measure  albumin  at  any  time 
during  the  study  that  a  serum  calcium  sample  is  taken  (see  Section 9.3.5, 
Serum Calcium Corrected for Albumin).

9.3.7. 

Assessment of Progressive Disease and Disease 
Response 

The investigator will perform tests that will allow evaluation of response to 
therapy  according  to  the  EBMT  criteria  presented  in  the  table.16  For 
quantitative immunoglobulin, M-protein, and immunofixation measurements 
in serum and 24-hour urine, the investigator will use results provided by the 
central laboratory. 

Assessment of Progressive Disease and Disease Response 
Time  to  progression  is  the  primary  endpoint  of  this  clinical  study. 
Progressive  disease  must  be  consistently  documented  across  clinical  study 
sites using the criteria in the table below. It is important that instances of PD 
be reported to the sponsor as soon as possible. Diagnosis and documentation 
of PD will be faxed within 24 hours to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (see 
Contact Information pages provided separately) using a form provided by the 
sponsor. 

The determination of PD and response  is largely  determined by M-protein 
changes  reported  by  the  central  laboratory  or  by  specific  measurements  of 
plasmacytomas  provided  by  the  investigators.  Progressive  disease  and 
response  will  be  assessed  by  the  sponsor  according  to  the  EBMT  criteria 
presented  in  the  table,  Disease  Response  Criteria.16  In  addition,  clinical 
relapse  will  be  assessed  according  to  the  recently  published  International 
Uniform  Response  Criteria  for  multiple  myeloma  established  by  the 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG).1 An attempt will be made 
to  collect  data  for  the  assessment  of  stringent  complete  response  (sCR)  if 
these data are available. 

A validated computer algorithm programmed in SAS will be used to assist 
the sponsor with assessment of PD and response. This algorithm allows for 
consistent  review  of  the  data  necessary  to  determine  PD  and  response 
according  to  the  EBMT  criteria.  Assessments  of  PD  and  response  by  the 
sponsor  (algorithm)  that  are  substantially  different  from  the  investigator 
assessment and that require medical judgment will be reviewed at a later date 
by independent experts, who will be blinded to treatment allocation. In such 
cases, the assessment of the independent experts will be used in the primary 
efficacy analyses.

Response 
Progressive Disease (PD) 
(for patients not in CR) 

 

Criteria for Response1 
Requires one or more of the following: 
•  >25% increase4 in the level of serum monoclonal paraprotein, which 
must also be an absolute increase of at least 5 g/L (500 mg/dL) and 
confirmed on a repeat investigation 

•  >25% increase4 in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion, which must 

also be an absolute increase of at least 200 mg/24 h and confirmed on a

Relapse from CR 

1  Adapted from the criteria reported by Blade et al., 1998.16 
2  According to Blade et al., 199816, if absence of the monoclonal protein is sustained for 6 weeks it is not 

necessary to repeat the bone marrow. In subjects with nonsecretory or oligosecretory myeloma the marrow 
examination (including 6 week follow-up examination) will be required. 

3  According to Blade et al., 199816, skeletal X-rays are not required for the definition of response, but if performed 

there must be no evidence of progression of bone disease (no increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions).  

4  The reference point for calculating any increase should be the lowest prior value documented at baseline or 

during the study unless the lowest prior value is considered to be spurious.  

5  A definite increase in size is defined as at least a 50% increase in the product of the greatest perpendicular 

dimensions. 

6  Other clinical data may be needed to assess the cause of the hypercalcemia before attributing it to myeloma 

disease progression.

For  subjects  with  nonsecretory  myeloma  (those  without  detectable 
paraprotein  in  the  blood  or  urine)  or  oligosecretory  myeloma  (those  with 
paraprotein  levels  in  the  blood  or  urine  that  are  too  low  to  accurately 
measure  changes  over  time),  evaluation  of  disease  response  will  be 
performed using clinical examination, radiological images, and bone marrow 
results.  

The  FREELITE™  assay  is  not  incorporated  in  the  protocol.  FREELITE™ 
test  results  should  not  be  used  in  the  assessment  of  progression  or  in  the 
assessment of response since the disease response criteria in the table do not 
include criteria for results of the FREELITE™ assay. However, an attempt 
will be made to collect available free light chain data for the assessment of 
sCR, according to the most recently published IMWG criteria.1 

Patient-Reported Outcome Assessments 

9.3.8. 
Two  PRO  instruments,  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  FACIT–F63-66  will  be 
administered and used to perform PRO analyses. A third PRO instrument, 
the  EQ-5D,  will  also  be  administered  and  used 
to  perform  a 
preference-based  utility  analysis  (see  Section 9.3.9,  Utility  Measurement). 
The EORTC QLQ-C30, FACIT–F, and EQ-5D are in Attachments 10, 11, 
and 12, respectively.

functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, 
and social functioning), 1 global health and quality of life scale, 3 symptom 
scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, 
insomnia,  appetite  loss,  constipation,  diarrhea,  and  financial  difficulties). 
The time recall period for this instrument is 1 week (the past week). It is a 
reliable and valid measure of PROs in patients with cancer and takes about 
11 minutes  to  administer.  The  instrument  consists  of  a  brief  (30-item) 
questionnaire that has been validated and used in many countries.

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

A  symptom-specific  scale,  the  FACIT-F,  will  be  used  in  this  study  to 
evaluate  the  sensitivity  to  anticipated  side  effects  of  VELCADE.  The 
FACIT-F  scale  has  13 items  and  has  been  validated  against  ECOG 
performance status in an oncology population. Subjects are asked to respond 
on a 5-point Likert scale. 

The subject will complete the 3 PRO instruments at the Screening Visit; on 
Day 1 of every treatment cycle (must be completed before other assessments 
are performed or study drug is administered); and at the End-of-Treatment 
Visit. PRO instruments are provided as part of the CRF. In the Posttreatment 
Phase, for subjects who discontinue study drug before disease progression 
and  before  completion  of  the  54 weeks  of  treatment  in  the  Open-label 
Treatment Phase, these evaluations should continue every 6 weeks for the 
remainder of the 54 weeks after the date of randomization, and then every 
8 weeks  thereafter  until  development  of  confirmed  PD.  For  subjects  who 
complete  the  54 weeks  of  treatment  in  the  Open-label,  Treatment  Phase 
before  disease  progression,  these  evaluations  will  be  performed  every 
8 weeks until development of confirmed PD. 

Utility Measurement 

9.3.9. 
The EQ-5D is a 5-item questionnaire and a “thermometer” visual analogue 
scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable 
health state) that will be administered at the same intervals as the EORTC 
QLQ-C30,  including  at  the  Screening  Visit  to  assess  the  comparability  of 
the groups at study initiation. 

Medical Resource Utilization Data Collection 

9.3.10. 
During the study, MRU data associated with medical encounters related to 
disease or myeloma therapies will be collected for all subjects. Specifically, 
MRU is evaluated based on the number of medical care encounters such as 
hospital admissions and their duration, outpatient visits, diagnostic tests and 
procedures, and concomitant medications. MRU data will be collected from 
all sites. The MRU data will be used to conduct economic analyses.

The  primary  endpoint,  TTP  will  be  measured  in  months  from  the  date  of 
randomization  to  the  date  of  the  first  observation  of  either  disease 
progression  or  relapse  from  immunofixation-negative  CR,  on  the  basis  of 
EBMT  criteria.  The  definition  of  disease  progression  and  relapse  from 
immunofixation-negative  CR  and  their  documentation  are  described  in  the 
disease response criteria in Section 9.3.7, Assessment of Progressive Disease 
and Disease Response. Death related to disease progression will be defined 
as an event if there is sufficient evidence for documentation of PD as defined 
in Section 9.3.7, Assessment of Progressive Disease and Disease Response. 
Subjects who withdraw from the study (i.e., withdrawal of consent, lost to 
follow up) or die of causes other than disease progression will be considered 
censored at the time of the last complete disease assessment. End of study is 
defined as 4.5 years after the last subject is randomly assigned.  

Secondary endpoints: 

•  Overall  survival:  OS  is  defined  as  the  time  between  randomization  and 
death.  Subjects  who  die,  regardless  of  the  cause  of  death,  will  be 
considered as an event. Subjects who withdraw consent for the study will 
be censored at the time of withdrawal. Subjects who complete the study 
and are still alive at the cutoff date of the final analysis will be censored at 
the cutoff date. All subjects who were lost to follow up prior to the end of 
the study will also be censored at the time of last contact.

time  between 
randomization and either disease progression or death, whichever occurs

complete the study, have not progressed, and are still alive at the cut-off 
date of the final analysis will be censored at the cutoff date. All subjects 
who  were  lost  to  follow  up  before  the  end  of  the  study  will  also  be

is  defined  as 

•  Objective response rates: CR rate, and Overall Response Rate (CR + PR). 
The  definition  of  each  response  is  described  in  the  disease  response 
criteria in Section 9.3.7, Assessment of Progressive Disease and Disease 
Response. 

•  Time to response: Time to response is defined in subjects with confirmed 
response as the time between randomization and the first documentation 
of response. Subjects without response will be censored either at the time 
of lost to follow up, disease progression, death, or at the end of the study 
treatment.

•  Duration  of  Response:  Duration  of  response  is  defined  in  subjects  with 
confirmed response as the time between first documentation of response 
and disease progression. Responders without disease progression will be 
censored at the last efficacy assessment for disease progression.

9.5.  Pharmacogenomics 

Rationale for DNA Sampling in Clinical Studies 

9.5.1. 
Any  association  identified  between  polymorphisms  in  the  candidate  genes 
shown below and drug or marker effect may help to identify a subpopulation 
that is likely to respond better to or better tolerate a given drug. By studying 
such  genetic  variations  and  their  effect  on  drug  response  and  safety,  the 
Sponsor  intends  to  develop  safer  and  more  effective  drugs  in  the  future. 
Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  collect  blood  samples  for  genetic  analysis  in 
clinical studies.  

VELCADE  is  eliminated  through  extensive  oxidative  metabolism  by  the 
CYP450  superfamily  of  enzymes.  It  is  thought  that  the  Phase 2  drug 
metabolism  does  not  significantly  contribute  to  VELCADE  disposition. 
More than 30 metabolites have thus far been identified but the primary route 
of VELCADE metabolism (>90%) is mediated by deboronation. The latter 
reaction  is  catalyzed  by  CYP2D6  and  CYP3A4  in  model  systems  in  vitro. 
Preliminary in vitro studies suggest that CYP2C19 can potentially make an 
additional  contribution  to  VELCADE  metabolism.  Although  in  vitro  drug 
metabolism studies may provide a preliminary insight on the contributions of 
various  CYP450  isozymes  and  drug  transporters  to  pharmacokinetics  of  a 
new molecular entity, a number of factors may hinder the extrapolation of 
data  obtained  in  vitro  to  in  vivo  disposition  in  humans.  Some  of  these  in 
vitro  confounding  factors  include  inherent  difficulties  in  estimation  of  the 
substrate  (drug)  concentration  at  the  site  of  metabolism  (e.g.,  inside  the 
hepatocytes) and differences in the relative affinity and abundance of various 
CYP450 isoforms among subjects. 

The clinical relevance of observations on in vitro metabolism of VELCADE 
by  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  and  CYP3A4  can  be  evaluated  by  correlations  of 
drug exposure in humans with functional genetic variants in the polymorphic 
drug disposition pathways. The presence of a genetic association between in 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

93

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

vivo  disposition  of  VELCADE  and  a  genetic  polymorphism  in  a  drug 
metabolism  or  drug  transporter  gene  may  suggest  the  need  to  reduce  the 
dosage in patients with inherited deficiencies in catalytic function to prevent 
toxicity.  Conversely,  patients  with  rapid  metabolism  due  to  genetic 
polymorphisms  may  require  higher  doses  to  ensure  optimal  drug  exposure 
and therapeutic response.  

As an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, VELCADE is thought to act through 
several  pharmacodynamic  mechanisms  to  exert  its  antitumor  effects.  In 
addition to genes related to drug exposure noted above, genetic variations in 
such  drug  targets  may  determine  interindividual  differences  in  therapeutic 
response  or 
(e.g.,  peripheral  neuropathy)  associated  with 
VELCADE.

Pharmacogenetic Blood Sample Collection 

9.5.2. 
A  whole  blood  sample  (approximately  10 mL)  for  pharmacogenetics 
(optional) will be collected during the Screening Phase for genetic analysis 
from  subjects  who  gave  informed  consent  for  this  part  of  the  study. 
Instructions  on  sample  handling,  labeling,  and  shipment  are  given  in 
Attachment 13. 

9.5.3. 

Genetic Testing Directly Linked to the Clinical Study 
(Part 1) 

There are 2 exploratory objectives of the genetic testing: 

•  to  analyze  DNA  samples  from  subjects  receiving  VELCADE  for 
CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP3A4,  and  CYP3A5  as  it  is  hypothesized  that 
these  genes  may 
influence  pharmacokinetic  parameters,  safety, 
tolerability, or therapeutic outcome (efficacy).  

•  to  determine  genes/genotypes  that  may  be  related  to  the  metabolism  of 
VELCADE, the response to VELCADE or susceptibility to or prognosis 
of  multiple  myeloma:  ABCB1,  ABCB2,  ABCC1,  CYP1A1,  CYP1A2,

these  candidate  genes  will  only  be  performed  if  it  is  believed  and 
hypothesized by the Pharmacogenomics Department or the clinical team 
that such genetic analysis might help resolve issues with the clinical data 
(e.g.,  an  adverse  event  in  a  subgroup  of  subjects,  responder  and 
nonresponder subgroups). 

Future Genetic Analysis (Part 2) 

9.5.4. 
Subjects will be asked also to provide consent for a DNA sample to be stored 
for future testing of genes related to VELCADE or multiple myeloma under 
investigation in this clinical study. The DNA samples and relevant clinical 
data will be held in a nonidentifiable format, in which case no link will be 
made between the genetic information and an individual subject. 

DNA Sample Disposition Procedures 

9.5.5. 
If a subject withdraws consent for genetic testing, any DNA extracted from 
the subject’s blood will be destroyed, provided that the sample has not yet 
undergone  conversion  to  the  nonidentifiable  format.  The  investigator  must 
notify the sponsor site contact, who will request sample destruction using the 
withdrawal of consent for genetic testing form. The investigator will receive 
written  confirmation  from  the  sponsor  that  the  DNA  sample  has  been 
destroyed.  If  the  sample  has  already  undergone  conversion  to  the 
nonidentifiable  format,  then  the  sponsor  will  notify  the  investigator  in 
writing. 

9.6.  Proteomics 

Rationale for Proteomic Analysis in Clinical Studies 
9.6.1. 
The use of analytic methods to identify tumor (or surrogate) biomarkers is an 
emerging  area  of  research  with  the  potential  to  identify  prognostic  and 
predictive  markers  during  early-mid  stage  drug  development.67  Several 
clinical studies provide encouraging data to suggest that proteomic patterns 
identified through surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight 
spectroscopy  (SELDI-TOF) 
learning 
algorithms can be used to develop diagnostic tests. For example, studies in 
ovarian  cancer  and  prostate  cancer  screening  provide  initial  evidence  that 
proteomic patterns in serum can distinguish healthy individuals from patients 
95

in  combination  with  supervised 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

with  cancer.68,69  Well  established  mass  spectrometry  (MS)  based  methods 
can serve to generate proteomic (or metabolomic) profiles that can be used 
for  identifying  novel  biomarkers.70  An  exploratory  proteomic/metabolomic 
analysis will be performed as part of this study. 

Proteomic Blood Sample Collection 

9.6.2. 
Proteomic  blood  samples  will  be  collected  from  a  subset  of  subjects 
(50 subjects  per  treatment  group).  A  whole  blood  sample  (10 mL)  will  be 
collected during screening and on Day 4 of Cycle 1 from subjects who gave 
informed consent for this part of the study. Instructions on sample handling, 
labeling, and shipment are given in Attachment 14.  

9.7.  Safety Evaluations 

The study will include the following evaluations of safety and tolerability: 
•  Adverse Events   

Adverse events will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a 
caregiver, surrogate, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative) for 
the  duration  of  the  study.  Adverse  events  will  be  followed  by  the 
investigator for a length of time as determined by the sponsor. Specific 
details on adverse event reporting are provided in Section 12. 

•  Clinical Laboratory Tests 

 

Blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology will be taken:  

–  within 14 days before randomization  
–  on Day 1 (or within 24 hours before) of each cycle  

 

 
 
 

(if the screening laboratory evaluations were performed within 
5 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1 dosing, it is not necessary to 
repeat these tests on Day 1 of Cycle 1) 

–  on Day 22 (or within 24 hours before) of each cycle  
–  at the End-of-Treatment Visit 

In subjects at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (such as Stage III of 
Slamon-Durie Staging or Stage II of the International Staging System 
[ISS]) it is also recommended to test electrolytes (sodium, potassium, 
chloride, calcium, and phosphate), uric acid, creatinine, and BUN/urea in 
the first cycle every time a hematology sample is scheduled. 
Additional blood samples for hematology will be taken:  

–  on  Days 8  and  29  (or  within  24 hours  before  each  day)  of  each 

cycle 

–  on Days 4, 11, 25, and 32 (or within 24 hours before each day) of 

each cycle for Treatment Group A (Vc-MP) 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

96

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

–  an additional hematology test can be scheduled at the investigator’s 

discretion in the treatment-free weeks (Week 3 and Week 6) 

Results  of  sodium,  potassium,  chloride,  creatinine,  and  BUN/urea  are 
required before dosing on Days 1 and 22 of each cycle.  
Results of hemoglobin, WBC count, platelet count, and ANC are required 
before  dosing  on  Day 1  of  each  cycle  and  on  each  day  of  VELCADE 
administration in each cycle.  
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, 
and record laboratory values indicative of the onset of an adverse event, 
the  most  abnormal  value  observed  during  the  adverse  event,  and  the 
resolution of the adverse event in the adverse event section of the CRF. 
Specific details on adverse event reporting are provided in Section 12. 
Should  subjects  have  their  laboratory  assessments  conducted  at  a 
laboratory facility other than the one associated with the investigational 
site,  the  investigator  must  submit  laboratory  certificates/accreditations 
and normal ranges. It is recognized that in some cases these may not be 
available  to  the  investigator  before  the  collection  of  the  laboratory 
samples.  
The following tests will be performed by the local laboratory: 

 

 

Hematology Panel  
Hemoglobin 
WBC count 
platelet count 

Serum Chemistry Panel  
Sodium 
Potassium 
Chloride 
BUN/urea 
Creatinine 
glucose (random) 
AST 
ALT 

absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 
 

total bilirubin 
alkaline phosphatase 
lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 
uric acid 
calcium 
phosphate 
albumin (or free ionized calcium) 
 

Blood samples for beta2-microglobulin and albumin at screening will be 
analyzed by the central laboratory. 
If female subjects are still having menstrual periods and are not surgically 
sterile,  they  must  have  a  negative  serum  β-HCG  pregnancy  test  at 
screening. Pregnancy tests (serum or urine) may be repeated throughout 
the study at the discretion of the Investigator.

•  Karnofsky Performance Status Scores 

 

The  Karnofsky  Performance  Status  Scale  is  presented  in  Attachment 2. 
Subjects  must  have  a  Karnofsky  performance  status  score  ≥60%  at 
screening to be eligible for the study. The Karnofsky Performance Status 
Scale  will  be  performed  on  Day 1  and  22  of  each  cycle,  and  at  the 
End-of-Treatment Visit. 

•  FACT/GOG-Ntx Questionnaire 

 

questionnaire 

FACT/GOG-Ntx

The 
(see 
Attachment 5)  is  provided  as  a  safety  checklist  to  help  determine  the 
presence and intensity of neuropathic pain or peripheral neuropathy based 
on the subjects’ reports and to guide interventions and dose modifications 
(see Section 6.2.5, VELCADE Dose Modifications for Neuropathic Pain 
or Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy). It consists of 10 items and evaluates 
symptoms  and  concerns  associated  specifically  with  chemotherapy-
induced neuropathy.60 Subjects are asked to respond on a 5-point Likert 
scale. 
 
The FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire should be completed by all subjects 
during the screening period, before dosing on Day 1 of each cycle and at 
the End-of-Treatment Visit. After the subject completes the FACT/GOG-
Ntx, it should be reviewed by the study staff to assist with the evaluation

Vital  signs  (heart  rate  and  blood  pressure)  will  be  measured  during  the 
screening period, before dosing on Day 1 and 22 of each cycle, and at the 
End-of-Treatment Visit.  
•  Physical Examination 

A complete physical examination will be performed during the screening 
period and at the End-of-Treatment Visit.  

 

•  Symptom-directed Physical Examination 

 

A  symptom-directed  physical  examination  will  be  performed  before 
dosing on Day 1 and Day 22 of each cycle. 

SUBJECT COMPLETION/WITHDRAWAL 

10. 
10.1.  Completion 

A  subject  will  be  considered  as  having  completed  the  study  if  he/she  has 
completed 9 cycles (54 weeks) of study treatment or has discontinued study 
treatment, has completed the End-of-Treatment Visit procedures, AND has 
documented PD or relapse from immunofixation-negative CR.  

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

98

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 
10.2.  Discontinuation of Treatment 

The treatment is to be continued for a maximum of 54 weeks (nine 6-week 
cycles) unless 1 of the following criteria for discontinuation is met.  

All study drugs MUST be discontinued if any of the following occurs: 

•  Overt  disease  progression,  as  defined  in  the  disease  response  criteria  in 

Section 9.3.7, Assessment of Progressive Disease and Disease Response 

•  Unacceptable toxicity  
•  More  than  3 weeks  delay  of  start  of  next  cycle  due  to  insufficient 
recovery from toxicity (unless clear clinical benefit, in which continuation 
of  therapy  and  subsequent  dose  reductions  should  be  approved  by  the 
sponsor) 

•  The  investigator  believes  it  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  subject  to 

discontinue study drug 

•  The subject refuses further study drug therapy  

All study drugs MAY be discontinued if any of the following occurs: 

•  A serious adverse event  
•  A serious protocol violation, as determined by the principal investigator 

or the sponsor 

For subjects who discontinue study drug, all procedures listed in the Time 
and Events Schedule in the Synopsis for the End-of-Treatment Visit will be 
performed 30 to 42 days after the last dose of study drug, and the subject will 
enter  the  Posttreatment  Phase  (see  Section  9.1.4,  Posttreatment  Phase,  for 
information on posttreatment visit schedule and procedures. The reason(s) a 
subject discontinues treatment are to be recorded on the CRF.  

10.3.  Withdrawal From the Study 

A subject will be withdrawn from the study if further follow up cannot be 
obtained: 

•  lost to follow up 
•  withdrawal of consent  
When  a  subject  withdraws  before  completing  the  study,  the  reason  for 
withdrawal  is  to  be  documented  on  the  CRF  and  in  the  source  document. 
Subjects  who  are  withdrawn  for  any  reason  may  not  re-enter  this  study. 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

99

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

Study drug assigned to the withdrawn subject may not be assigned to another 
subject. Subjects who withdraw will not be replaced. 

Subjects  withdrawing  from  the  main  part  of  the  study  will  be  given  the 
following  options  regarding  genetic  testing,  providing  that  the  sample  has 
not yet undergone conversion to the nonidentifiable format: 

•  The DNA extracted from the subject’s blood will be retained and used for 
testing  for  genes  identified  in  the  protocol  and  may  be  used  for 
genotyping in the future (as outlined in the subject’s informed consent). 

•  The DNA sample will be destroyed and no further testing will take place. 
The  investigator  must  notify  the  sponsor  site  contact  to  request  sample 
destruction using the withdrawal of consent for genetic testing form. The 
sponsor site contact will contact the pharmacogenomics representative for 
sample  destruction.  The  investigator  will  receive  written  confirmation 
from the sponsor that the sample has been destroyed. 

STATISTICAL METHODS 

11. 
11.1.  Study Population 

Two study populations, intent to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP), will be 
used  in  the  statistical  analyses.  The  ITT  population  is  defined  as  all 
randomly  assigned  subjects.  Subjects  with  treatment  errors  (i.e.,  receive 
incorrect  study  drug  according  to  randomization)  will  be  included  in  the 
group to which they were randomly assigned for the ITT analysis. The PP 
population is a subset of the ITT population defined as those subjects who 
meet  all  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  receive  correct  study  drug 
according to randomization, and receive 8 doses of VELCADE and 4 doses 
of melphalan and prednisone in the first treatment cycle for those assigned to 
Treatment  Group A,  and  4 doses  of  melphalan  and  prednisone  in  the  first 
treatment  cycle  for  those  assigned  to  Treatment  Group B.  The  primary 
analysis will be performed using data for the ITT population. The analyses 
using data for the PP population will be considered secondary and sensitivity 
analyses. All randomly assigned subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study 
drug will be included in the safety analyses. 

11.2.  Sample Size Determination 

The sample size calculation is performed on the basis of certain assumptions, 
as described. From previous clinical experience, the median TTP for the MP 
arm  is  18 months.31-34  Assuming  Vc-MP  can  improve  TTP  by  33%,  i.e., 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

100

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

assuming  the  hazard  ratio  (MP  vs.  Vc-MP)  of  1.33,  the  total  number  of 
events needed for the study is a minimum of 390 (power is 80% and 2-sided 
alpha is 0.05). With an 18-month accrual period and an 18-month follow up, 
the  total  sample  size  needed  for  the  study  is  approximately  680  (340/arm) 
subjects.  The  sample  size  calculation  has  taken  a  5%  dropout  rate  into 
consideration. 

This sample size (with an 18-month follow up) also provides an 80% power 
for  the  detection  of  a  42%  improvement  in  overall  survival  (hazard  ratio: 
1.42,  MP/Vc-MP)  with  a  2-sided  significance  level  of  0.05,  assuming  the 
median  survival  for  the  MP  arm  is  30 months  and  for  the  Vc-MP  arm  is 
42.5 months. With an additional 36-month follow up (i.e., total of 54 months 
follow  up)  the  study  can  detect  a  30%  improvement  in  overall  survival 
(hazard ratio: 1.30, MP/Vc-MP) with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and 
the  power  of  80%,  assuming  the  median  survival  for  the  MP  arm  is  30 
months and for the Vc-MP arm is 39 months. 

11.3.  Pharmacokinetics 

The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration 
of melphalan and prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of VELCADE. 

The intrasubject coefficient of variation for AUC24h and Cmax of VELCADE 
is assumed to be less than 15%. Using an intrasubject coefficient of variation 
of  15%,  a  sample  size  of  16  subjects  would  be  sufficient  for  the  point 
estimate  of 
the  ratio  of  mean  of  VELCADE  with  and  without 
co-administration of melphalan and prednisone to fall within 87% and 115% 
of the true ratio with 90% confidence. 

All estimated pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized by descriptive 
statistical analysis. 

The primary parameters of interest for the statistical analysis will be AUC24h 
and Cmax of VELCADE. The analysis will be performed on log-transformed 
estimated  pharmacokinetic  parameters.  The  statistical  analysis  will  include 
data 
the 
pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 25 of Cycle 1 (without coadministration 
with  MP)  and  Day  4  of  Cycle  2  (with  coadministration  with  MP).  Mixed 
effects models will be fit to the data with 1 of the estimated pharmacokinetic 

successfully  complete 

from  only 

those 

subjects  who

the  mixed  effects  model  will  be  used 

parameters of interest as the dependent variable, treatment as fixed effect, and 
subject as a random effect. The estimated least square means and intrasubject 
variance  from 
to  construct 
90% confidence intervals for the difference in means on the log scale between 
the 2 treatments. The limits of the confidence intervals will be retransformed 
using  antilogarithms  to  obtain  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  of  the 
mean  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  VELCADE  with  and  without 
coadministration of melphalan and prednisone. 

11.4.  Efficacy Analyses * 

All statistical tests will be 2-sided with the significance level of 0.05. 

The  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC),  on  13  September 
2007,  has  notified  the  sponsor  that,  on  the  occasion  of  the  third  interim 
analysis,  the  pre-specified  statistical  boundary  for  TTP  has  been  crossed. 
Because of the highly significant difference in efficacy endpoints observed 
between  the  2  treatment  arms,  in  favor  of  the  Vc-MP  treatment  group,  as 
well  as  a  favorable  benefit  risk  ratio  for  the  study,  the  IDMC  releases  the 
third interim data to the Sponsors’ Steering Committee. 

Based on IDMC recommendations, the Sponsor has decided to unblind the 
study  and  to  analyze  efficacy  and  safety  data  and  to  report  results.  The 
updated  OS  analysis  will  be  performed  when  174  deaths  (2/3  of  the  total 
number of deaths planned) have been observed to confirm the early survival 
benefit  observed.  The  O’Brien-Fleming  alpha  spending  function72  will  be 
used  to  control  the  overall  type  I  error  for  survival  analysis.  With  the  3 
interim analyses performed, the  O’Brien-Fleming boundary  will be 2.5228 
(2-sided alpha=0.01164) at the survival analysis with 174 deaths, and 1.9946 
(2-sided alpha=0.04609) at the final analysis with 260 deaths. 

Primary Efficacy Endpoint 

11.4.1. 
The  primary  analysis  will  consist  of  a  stratified  log-rank  test  for  the 
comparison of the TTP distribution between the 2 treatments. Stratification

method  will  be  used  to  estimate  the  distribution  of  overall  TTP  for  each 
treatment. The log-rank test will be considered as a sensitivity analysis.

formal comparison of the response duration between the 2 treatment groups 
because they are not statistically comparable.  

Patient-Reported Outcomes Analyses 

11.4.3. 
Patient-reported  outcome  assessments  using  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and 
FACIT-F  subscale  surveys,  will  be  analyzed  to  determine  if  response  to 
therapy and side effects of therapy are accompanied by measurable changes 
in the PROs. The analysis will be performed on summary scores as well as 
on  subscales  and  individual  symptoms,  with  specific  analytical  methods 
outlined in a formal statistical analysis plan developed prior to database lock.  

Differences between treatment groups in the EORTC QLQ-C30 scores will 
be  evaluated  using  published  methods.66,71  Specific  interest  centers  on 
physical functioning, global quality of life summary scores, and individual

item  scores  for  fatigue,  nausea/vomiting,  pain,  dyspnea,  appetite  loss,  and 
constipation/diarrhea.  

The  primary  endpoint  for  the  PRO  analysis  will  be  the  global  health 
status/quality of life subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30. The change in PRO 
scores between baseline and each postbaseline assessment will be described 
overall  and  according  to  the  response  to  treatment.  The  secondary  PRO 
endpoints include the remaining EORTC QLQ-C30 subscale and individual 
item  scores,  and  the  FACIT-F  item  scores.  The  change  in  scores  will  be 
tabulated.  

The  analysis  of  PRO  scores  will  be  performed  as  a  repeated-measures 
analysis using all available time points. The analysis will use mixed model 
analysis of variance. 

Baseline Assessments 

11.4.4. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment 
group. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
such  as  mean,  standard  deviation,  and  range.  Categorical  variables  will  be 
summarized using frequency tables. 

Missing Data 

11.4.5. 
In  PROs  and  other  secondary  analyses,  if  necessary,  missing  data  will  be 
imputed  using  the  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  method.  The 
missing  pattern  will  be  examined  before  any  imputation.  If  the  missing 
pattern is evidently informative, the impact of nonrandom missing data will 
be assessed using sensitivity analyses. 

For PROs, if a multi-item subscale has a missing item, then the average of 
the remaining items will be used as the Scale score, as long as at least half 
the  items  in  that  Scale  are  present.  Example:  for  Fatigue  in  EORTC 
QLQ-C30, if Item 12 is missing, the average score of Items 10 and 18 will 
be used.

11.5.  Interim Analyses 

Three interim analyses are planned in this study. The O’Brien-Fleming alpha 
spending  function72  will  be  used  to  establish  the  statistical  monitoring 
guideline  in  order  to  control  the  overall  Type 1  error  rate.  The  statistical 
stopping boundary at each interim analysis will be calculated on the basis of 
the actual number of progression events observed. 

interim  analysis  will  be  performed  when  approximately 
The  first 
100 subjects  (50 per  arm)  have  been  on  study  long  enough  to  complete 
1 treatment cycle (all doses of melphalan and prednisone, and at least 6 of 
the  8 doses  of  VELCADE)  or  have  been  terminated  early.  The  primary 
purpose of the first interim analysis is to assess safety. Since few progression 
events (<20) are expected at the time of the first interim analysis, the alpha 
penalty will be negligible. 

The  second  interim  analysis  will  be  performed  when  approximately 
570 subjects  have  been  enrolled.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  time  required  to 
enroll 570 subjects will be approximately 15 months after the first subject is 
randomly  assigned.  It  is  also  anticipated  that  at  the  time  of  the  second 
interim  analysis,  approximately  120 progression  events  will  have  been 
observed. At the second interim analysis, the safety will be assessed and the 
efficacy endpoints TTP, OS, PFS, and response rate will be analyzed. The 
primary objective for the second interim analysis is to re-evaluate the sample 
size using accumulated study data (approximately 30% of data). Sample size 
may be increased to ensure adequate power of the study. The study may be 
stopped  if  the  result  of  the  TTP  analysis  is  statistically  significant  at  the 
0.0001  level  at  the  time  of  the  second  interim  analysis,  assuming  that 
120 progression events have been observed.  

The third interim analysis will be performed when approximately two thirds 
of the events (260 events) have been observed or 1 year has elapsed after the 
second interim analysis, whichever comes first. The study may be stopped if 
the result of the TTP analysis is significant at the 0.0121 level, assuming that 
120 progression events have been observed at the time of the second interim 
analysis and 260 progression events have been observed at the time of the 
third interim analysis. The safety will be assessed and the secondary efficacy 
endpoints, including OS, PFS, and response rate, will also be analyzed.  

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

105

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

The  final  analysis  will  be  performed  at  the  significance  level  of  0.0463, 
assuming the observation of 120 progression events at the time of the second 
interim analysis and 260 progression events at the time of the third interim 
analysis.  If  the  study  is  stopped  early  because  of  a  statistically  significant 
improvement  in  efficacy  in  favor  of  the  VELCADE  arm,  subjects  in  the 
VELCADE arm can continue the treatment and subjects in the MP arm can 
be crossed over to the VELCADE arm.  

Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
An  IDMC  will  be  formed  and  constituted  according  to  regulatory  agency 
guidelines  (such  as  FDA  guidelines).  An  independent  statistician  will 
perform the interim analyses and the results of each interim analysis will be 
evaluated  by  the  IDMC.  The  IDMC  will  meet  after  completion  of  each 
interim  analysis  to  review  cumulative  efficacy  and  safety  data.  Detailed 
information  regarding  the  composition  of  the  IDMC  and  detailed  IDMC 
procedures will be provided in the IDMC charter. 

11.6.  Safety Analyses 

The  safety  parameters  to  be  evaluated  are  the  incidence  and  severity  of 
adverse  events,  vital  signs  (heart  rate  and  blood  pressure),  physical 
examinations, Karnofsky status scores, FACT/GOG-Ntx scores, and clinical 
laboratory tests.  

Adverse Events 
Detailed  tabulations  of  safety  data  will  be  provided  for  all  subjects  who 
receive study drug. The original terms used in the CRFs by investigators to 
identify  adverse  events  will  be  coded  using  the  Medical  Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities  Terminology  (MedDRA)  dictionary.  Treatment-
emergent adverse events are adverse events that occur after the first dose of 
study drug, through the treatment period, and for 30 days following the last 
dose  of  study  drug;  any  event  that  is  considered  study-drug-related 
regardless  of  the  start  date  of  the  event;  or  any  event  that  is  present  at 
baseline but worsens in severity or is subsequently considered drug-related 
by  the  investigator.  The  number  and  percent  of  subjects  with  treatment-
emergent  adverse  events  will  be  summarized  according  to  intensity  (NCI 
CTCAE  grade)  and  drug  relationship  (Section 12.1.2)  and  categorized  by 
System  Organ  Class  and  preferred  term  by  treatment  group.  Selected

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

measures  of  clinical  benefit,  e.g.,  frequency  of  Grade 3  or  Grade 4 
infections,  will  be  provided.  Summaries  of  other  safety  parameters  by 
treatment group will also be provided where appropriate. 

Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory data will be summarized according to the type of laboratory test. 
Descriptive  statistics  will  be  calculated  for  each  laboratory  analyte  at 
baseline and at each scheduled time point. The laboratory data for subjects 
with  any  postbaseline  results  outside 
the  reference  range  will  be 
summarized, when appropriate, by use of the NCI-CTCAE grade. 

Karnofsky Performance Status  
The Karnofsky Performance Status scores will be summarized and analyzed 
using appropriate tests. 

FACT/GOG-Ntx 
The  analysis  of  FACT/GOG-Ntx  scores  will  include  change  from  baseline 
and relationship of scores to treatment-related events. 

Vital Signs and Physical Examination 
Changes  in  vital  sign  and  physical  examination  parameters  will  be 
summarized over time and any abnormal values will be tabulated. 

11.7.  Pharmacogenomic Analyses 

The  objective  of  the  pharmacogenomics  analysis  is  to  determine  whether 
genes  that  code  for  proteins  that  may  be  involved  in  the  absorption, 
distribution,  metabolism,  elimination  or  transport  (ADME)  of  VELCADE 
impact drug response-related endpoints. The association between the ADME 
genes and drug response-related endpoints will be evaluated using either an 
ANCOVA  model,  logistic  regression  model,  or  Cox  Proportional  Hazards 
Model, depending on whether the endpoint of interest is continuous, binary, 
or “Time to event”, after adjusting for relevant baseline covariates. For each 
association  analysis,  genotypes  for  a  given  gene  (CYP2C19,  CYP2D6, 
CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) will be pooled into metabolic categories (i.e., alleles 
that produce an inactive versus a normally functioning protein) to increase 
power  when  possible.  P-values  will  be  estimated  using  5,000  permutated 
samples.  For  genes  with  a  significant  impact  on  an  endpoint,  descriptive

107

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

statistics such as least square-means, proportion of subjects with a particular 
binary response will be presented after stratifying by genotype. Additionally, 
95% confidence intervals will be estimated using 5,000 bootstrap samples. 

11.8.  Proteomic Analyses 

Proteomic/metabolomic  analyses  will  be  performed  by  Millennium  in 
Cambridge (MA, USA). Mass spectrometry based methods and supervised 
learning  algorithms  will  be  used  to  analyze  the  serum  samples  to  identify 
biomarkers that can be used for prognostic or predictive tests. 

12.  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 

Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information 
from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, 
and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The 
sponsor  has  established  Standard  Operating  Procedures 
in 
conformity  with  regulatory  requirements  worldwide  to  ensure  appropriate 
reporting of safety information; all clinical studies conducted by the sponsor 
or its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with those procedures. 

(SOPs) 

12.1.  Definitions 

Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications 

12.1.1. 
•  Adverse Event 

 

An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product. An adverse event does not 
necessarily  have  a  causal  relationship  with  the  treatment.  An  adverse 
event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal  finding),  symptom,  or  disease  temporally  associated  with  the 
use  of  a  medicinal  (investigational)  product,  whether  or  not  related  to  
the  medicinal  (investigational)  product.  (Definition  per  International 
Conference on Harmonization [ICH]) 
 
This  includes  any  occurrence  that  is  new  in  onset  or  aggravated  in 
severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of 
diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. 

 

Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the first study-related 
procedure  (not  with  the  signing  of  the  informed  consent).  The  first  study-
related procedure might include discontinuation from or decrease in current 
therapy, a study-specific assessment or scale, or a study-specific procedure 
(e.g., laboratory test, X-ray, physical examination, placebo run-in). 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

108

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

•  Serious Adverse Event   

A  serious  adverse  event  as  defined  by  ICH  is  any  untoward  medical 
occurrence that at any dose meets any of the following conditions: 
–  results in death 
–  is life-threatening 

(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe.) 

 

–  requires 

inpatient  hospitalization  or  prolongation  of  existing 

hospitalization 

–  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
–  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Note:  Medical  and  scientific  judgment  should  be  exercised  in  deciding 
whether  expedited  reporting  is  also  appropriate  in  situations  other  than 
those  listed  above.  For  example,  important  medical  events  may  not  be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition above. Any adverse event is considered 
a serious adverse event if it is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
judged by the investigator to have a significant clinical impact. 

•  Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event  

An  unlisted  adverse  event,  the  nature  or  severity  of  which  is  not 
consistent with the applicable product information. For an investigational 
product,  the  expectedness  of  an  adverse  event  will  be  determined  by 
whether or not it is listed in the Investigator's Brochure. For a comparator 
product  with  a  marketing  authorization,  the  expectedness  of  an  adverse 
event  will  be  determined  by  whether  or  not  it  is  listed  in  the  CPMP-
approved summary of product characteristics (SmPC).  

•  Associated With the Use of the Drug 

 

An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the 
attribution is possible, probable, or very likely by the definitions listed in 
Section 12.1.2, Intensity Reporting and Attribution. 

Intensity (Severity) Reporting and Attribution 

12.1.2. 
For  both  serious  and  nonserious  adverse  events,  the  investigator  must 
determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to 
study drug administration.  

Intensity for each adverse event will be determined by using Version 3.0 of 
the NCI CTCAE as a guideline, wherever possible. The NCI CTCAE criteria 
will be provided to the investigator as a separate document. In those cases 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

109

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

where the NCI CTCAE do not apply, intensity should be defined according 
to the following criteria: 

•  Mild (Grade 1) 

Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated 

•  Moderate  (Grade 2) 

Discomfort enough to cause interference with normal daily activities 

•  Severe (Grade 3) 

Inability to perform normal daily activities 

•  Life Threatening (Grade 4) 

Immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred 

Relationship to study drug administration will be determined as follows: 
•  Not related 

 

An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug. 

•  Doubtful   

An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g., 
concomitant  drug(s),  concomitant  disease(s),  or  the  relationship  in  time 
suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely. 

•  Possible 

An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative 
explanation,  e.g.,  concomitant  drug(s),  concomitant  disease(s), 
is 
inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the causal 
relationship cannot be excluded. 

•  Probable 

An  adverse  event  that  might  be  due  to  the  use  of  the  drug.  The 
relationship  in  time  is  suggestive  (e.g.,  confirmed  by  dechallenge).  An 
alternative  explanation 
likely,  e.g.,  concomitant  drug(s), 
concomitant disease(s). 

less 

is 

•  Very likely 

 

An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot 
be reasonably explained by an alternative explanation, e.g., concomitant 
drug(s),  concomitant  disease(s).  The  relationship  in  time  is  very 
suggestive (e.g., it is confirmed by dechallenge and rechallenge). 

12.2.  Procedures 

All Adverse Events 

12.2.1. 
All adverse events, with the exception of progression of multiple myeloma, 
will  be  reported  from  the  first  study-related  procedure  until  30 days 
following the last dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent systemic 
antimyeloma therapy, if earlier. Resolution information after 30 days should 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

110

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

also  be  provided.  (For  studies  conducted  in  France,  the  first  study-related 
procedure begins with the signing of the Informed Consent Form.) Adverse 
events occurring after 30 days should also be reported if considered related 
to study drug.  

All Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events considered related to study drug must 
be followed until recovery to Grade 0 or 1. Neuropathic and cardiac adverse 
events of Grade 2 or higher will be followed until improvement to Grade 0 
or 1. The unresolved aforementioned events will be followed for a maximum 
of 6 months. 

Clinically  relevant  changes  in  laboratory  values  must  be  recorded  in  the 
adverse  event  section  of  the  CRF.  For  example,  laboratory  abnormalities 
leading to an action regarding the study drug (dose change, temporary stop, 
delay of the start of a cycle or permanent stop) or the start of concomitant 
therapy should be reported. For each laboratory abnormality reported as an 
adverse  event,  the  following  laboratory  values  should  be  reported  in  the 
laboratory  section  of  the  CRF:  the  value  indicative  of  the  onset  of  each 
toxicity grade, the most abnormal value observed during the adverse event, 
and the value supporting recovery to Grade 0 or 1 or to baseline condition. 

Adverse  events  meeting  the  definition  of  serious  adverse  events  must  be 
reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor will evaluate 
any  safety  information  that  is  spontaneously  reported  by  an  investigator 
beyond the time frame specified in the protocol. 

All  adverse  events,  regardless  of  seriousness,  severity,  or  presumed 
relationship to study therapy, must be recorded using medical terminology in 
the source document and the CRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be 
given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, 
runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as 
“upper  respiratory  infection”).  Investigators  must  record  in  the  CRF  their 
opinion concerning the relationship of the adverse event to study therapy. All 
measures  required  for  adverse  event  management  must  be  recorded  in  the 
source document and reported according to sponsor instructions. 

The  sponsor  assumes  responsibility  for  appropriate  reporting  of  adverse 
events  to  the  regulatory  authorities.  The  sponsor  will  also  report  to  the 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

111

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

investigator all serious adverse events that are unlisted and associated with 
the use of the drug. The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report 
these  events  to  the  appropriate  Independent  Ethics  Committee/Institutional 
Review  Board  (IEC/IRB)  that  approved  the  protocol  unless  otherwise 
required and documented by the IEC/IRB. 

Subjects (or their designees, if appropriate) must be provided with a “study 
card” indicating the name of the investigational product, the study number, 
the  investigator’s  name,  a  24-hour  emergency  contact  number,  and,  if 
applicable, excluded concomitant medications.  

Serious Adverse Events 

12.2.2. 
Serious adverse events should be recorded until 30 days after the last dose of 
study drug or until the start of subsequent systemic antimyeloma therapy, if 
earlier.  All  deaths  are  reported  as  serious  adverse  events  until  30 days 
following the last dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent systemic 
antimyeloma therapy, if earlier.  

All serious adverse events occurring during clinical studies must be reported 
to  the  appropriate  sponsor  contact  person  by  investigational  staff  within 
24 hours of their knowledge of the event. 

Information  regarding  serious  adverse  events  will  be  transmitted  to  the 
sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form, which must be signed by a 
member  of  the  investigational  staff. The  initial  report  of  a  serious  adverse 
event  may  be  made  by  facsimile  (fax)  or  telephone.  It  is  preferable  that 
serious adverse events be reported via fax. Subsequent to a telephone report 
of a serious adverse event, a Serious Adverse Event Form must be completed 
by the investigational staff and transmitted to the sponsor within 1 working 
day. 

All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study, or 
that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in 
the study, must be followed until any of the following occurs:  

–  the event resolves 
–  the event stabilizes 
–  the event returns to baseline, if a baseline value is available 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

112

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

–  the  event  can  be  attributed  to  agents  other  than  the  study  drug  or  to 

factors unrelated to study conduct 

–  when  it  becomes  unlikely  that  any  additional  information  can  be 
obtained  (subject  or  health  care  practitioner  refusal  to  provide 
additional  information,  lost  to  follow  up  after  demonstration  of  due 
diligence with follow-up efforts) 

The  cause  of  death  of  a  subject  in  a  clinical  study,  whether  the  event  is 
expected or associated with the investigational agent, is considered a serious 
adverse  event.  Any  event  requiring  hospitalization  (or  prolongation  of 
hospitalization) that occurs during the course of a subject’s participation in a 
clinical  study  must  be  reported  as  a  serious  adverse  event,  except 
hospitalizations for: 

•  a  standard  procedure  for  protocol  therapy  administration  will  not  be 
reported  as  a  Serious  Adverse  Event.  Hospitalization  or  prolonged 
hospitalization  for  a  complication  of  therapy  administration  will  be 
reported as a Serious Adverse Event. 

•  the  administration  of  blood  or  platelet  transfusion.  Hospitalization  or 
prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such transfusion remains a 
reportable serious adverse event. 

•  a  procedure  for  protocol/disease-related  investigations  (e.g.,  surgery, 
scans, endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling). 
Hospitalization  or  prolonged  hospitalization  for  a  complication  of  such 
procedures remains a reportable serious adverse event. 

•  prolonged  hospitalization  for  technical,  practical,  or  social  reasons,  in 

absence of an adverse event. 

•  a procedure that is planned (i.e., planned prior to starting of treatment on 
study; must be documented in the CRF). Prolonged hospitalization for a 
complication considered to be at least possibly related to the study drug 
remains a reportable serious adverse event. 

Pregnancies  

12.2.3. 
Subject  pregnancy  must  be  reported  by  the  investigational  staff  within 
1 working  day  of  their  knowledge  of  the  event  using  the  pregnancy 
notification form. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must 
be promptly withdrawn from the study.  

Because the study drug may have an effect on sperm, pregnancies in partners 
of male subjects included in the study will be reported by the investigational 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

113

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

staff  within  1 working  day  of  their  knowledge  of  the  event  using  the 
pregnancy notification form. 

Follow-up  information  regarding  the  outcome  of  the  pregnancy  and  any 
postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required. 

12.3.  Contacting Sponsor Regarding Safety 

The  names  of  the  individuals  (and  corresponding  phone  numbers)  who 
should be contacted regarding safety issues or questions regarding the study 
are listed on the Contact Information page(s), which will be provided as a 
separate document.

The melphalan tablets will be given to subjects as a full bottle, as provided 
by the sponsor. If local regulations require/permit, repackaging of melphalan 
in  individual  subject  doses  is  allowed.  The  subject-specific  containers  will 
then  be  labeled  following  specific  procedures  provided  by  the  sponsor,  in 
accordance  with  Good  Manufacturing  Practices  (GMP)  requirements  for

the  sponsor.  If 

The prednisone tablets will be provided to subjects as bulk supply provided 
by 
local  regulations  require/permit,  repackaging  of 
prednisone  in  individual  subject  doses  is  allowed.  The  subject-specific 
containers will then be labeled following specific procedures provided by the 
sponsor,  in  accordance  with  GMP  requirements  for  repackaging  and 
relabeling.  It  is  preferred  that  the  dispensing  containers  be  child  resistant. 
The  pharmacist  will  record  the  prednisone  dispensing  information  in  the 
drug dispensing log/drug accountability form. 

13.3.  Labeling 

Study drug labels will contain information to meet the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  Refer 
to  Section 5,  Randomization  and  Blinding  and 
Section 13.2, Packaging for additional instructions on labeling. 

13.4.  Preparation and Handling 

Vials  containing  lyophilized  VELCADE  for  Injection  should  be  stored  at 
controlled  room  temperature.  To  date,  stability  data  indicate  that  the 
lyophilized drug product is stable for at least 18 months when stored under 
the recommended conditions. Stability studies are ongoing, and the sponsor 
will  notify  the  investigator  should  this  information  be  revised  during  the 
conduct of the study. 

VELCADE  is  cytotoxic.  As  with  all  cytotoxic  drugs,  caution  is  required 
when  preparing  and  handling  VELCADE.  Cytotoxic  drugs  should  only  be 
handled by staff specially trained in the safe handling of such preparations. 
The use of gloves and other appropriate protective clothing is recommended. 

Study drug will be supplied in sterile, single-use vials containing 3.5 mg of 
VELCADE.  Each  vial  of  VELCADE  for  Injection  should  be  reconstituted 
under a laminar flow biological cabinet (hood), within 8 hours before dosing, 
with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium Chloride Injection, so that the 
reconstituted solution contains VELCADE at  a concentration of 1 mg/mL.

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

Dissolution  is  completed  in  approximately  10 seconds.  The  reconstituted 
solution  is  clear  and  colorless,  with  a  final  pH  of  5  to  6.  Reconstituted 
VELCADE  should  be  administered  promptly  and  in  no  case  more  than 
8 hours after reconstitution. In case of skin contact, wash the affected area 
immediately  and  thoroughly  with  soap  and  water  and  diluted  hydrogen 
peroxide  for  15  minutes.  If  product  contacts  eye,  immediately  flush  eye 
thoroughly  with  water  for  at  least  15 minutes.  Always  contact  a  physician 
after  any  form  of  body  contact.  All  materials  that  have  been  used  for 
preparation  should  be  disposed  of  according  to  standard  practices.  A  log 
must be kept of all disposed materials.

for  additional 

Melphalan  should  be  handled  following  guidelines  for  the  handling  of 
cytotoxic  drugs  according  to  prevailing  local  recommendations  and/or 
regulations. Provided the outer coating of the tablet is intact, there is no risk 
in  handling  melphalan  tablets.  Melphalan  tablets  should  be  destroyed  in 
accordance  with  relevant  local  regulatory  requirements  for  the  disposal  of 
cytotoxic drugs. 

13.5.  Drug Accountability 

The  clinical  investigator  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  study  drug 
received  at  the  site  is  inventoried  and  accounted  for  throughout  the  study. 
The  pharmacist  will  record  dispensing 
information  for  VELCADE, 
melphalan,  and  prednisone  on  the  drug  accountability  form  or  in  a  drug 
dispensing log. Subjects will be given a study drug diary to record the date 
of administration of each dose of melphalan and prednisone. Subjects will be 
asked to return the diary at their next visit. Study staff must review returned 
drug at the subject’s next visit. Subject study drug diaries will be reconciled 
with  the  study  drug  inventory  by  the  site  monitor.  The  administration  of 
VELCADE, melphalan, and prednisone must be documented on the CRF for 
each day of dosing, showing dates and dose(s) administered. Study drug will 
be stored and disposed of according to the sponsor’s instructions. Contents 
of the study drug containers must not be combined. 

Study drug must be handled strictly in accordance with the protocol and the 
container  label  and  will  be  stored  in  a  limited  access  area  or  in  a  locked 

FINAL – 7 February 2008

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

cabinet under appropriate environmental conditions. Unused study drug must 
be  available  for  verification  by  the  sponsor’s  site  monitor  during  on-site 
monitoring  visits.  The  return  to  the  sponsor  of  unused  study  drug  will  be 
documented on the Drug Return Form. 

Vials and used syringes should be discarded in  a safe manner, i.e., do not 
retain for accountability at the site. Partially used vials should be destroyed.  

Study drug should be administered under the supervision of the investigator 
or  a  subinvestigator.  Study  drug  will  be  administered  only  to  subjects 
participating  in  the  study.  The  investigator  agrees  neither  to  dispense  the 
study  drug  from,  nor  store  it  at,  any  site  other  than  the  study  sites  agreed 
upon with the sponsor. 

14. 

STUDY-SPECIFIC MATERIALS 
In addition to the study drugs, the following supplies or documents will be 
provided to the investigator: 

•  Blood  collection  tubes,  labels,  and  associated  supplies  required  for  the 

collection of pharmacogenomic and proteomic samples  

•  Selected  investigational  sites  will  be  provided  with  all  material  and 

associated supplies required for pharmacokinetic samples 

•  A copy of the current VELCADE Company Core Data Sheet 
•  A copy of the current Investigator Brochure for VELCADE 
•  A copy of the SmPCs for melphalan and prednisone, where applicable 
•  A copy of the NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0 

An  IDMC  has  been  commissioned  for  this  study.  Details  regarding 
objectives  and  procedures  for  this  committee  are  contained  in  a  separate 
IDMC Charter. 

ETHICAL ASPECTS 

15. 
15.1.  Study-Specific Design Considerations 

The  study  is  a  randomized,  open-label  design.  As  the  experimental  agent 
VELCADE  is  administered  intravenously,  for  ethical  reason  no  placebo 
control is used to avoid repetitive intravenous administrations of a placebo 
solution in the control arm. The study population is well defined (previously 
untreated  multiple  myeloma,  not  candidates  for  high-dose  chemotherapy 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

117

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

with stem cell transplantation) and will receive the standard-of-care therapy 
(MP) in both arms of the study.  

VELCADE  is  added  to  MP  in  the  experimental  arm.  VELCADE  is  a 
well-tolerated drug that is approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory 
multiple  myeloma  and  has  already  shown  interesting  antitumor  activity  in 
previously  untreated  multiple  myeloma.  Therefore, 
the  addition  of 
VELCADE to standard MP may provide additional clinical benefit. 

All  participating  subjects  will  receive  full  supportive  care  and  will  be 
followed  closely  for  safety  and  efficacy  throughout  the  study.  Efficacy 
assessments  will  occur  according  to  the  internationally  accepted  EBMT 
criteria. Safety assessments will occur through regular clinic visits including 
laboratory  analyses.  Special  attention  is  given  to  the  early  detection  of 
neurotoxicity  (through  the  FACT/GOG-Ntx  questionnaire  checklist  and 
investigator  assessment).  Safety  and  efficacy  will  be  followed  during  the 
study in 3 prespecified interim analyses by an IDMC. 

15.2.  Regulatory Ethics Compliance 

Investigator Responsibilities 

15.2.1. 
The  investigator  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  clinical  study  is 
performed in accordance with the protocol, current ICH guidelines on Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements. 

Good  Clinical  Practice  is  an  international  ethical  and  scientific  quality 
standard  for  designing,  conducting,  recording,  and  reporting  studies  that 
involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard 
provides  public  assurance  that  the  rights,  safety,  and  well  being  of  study 
subjects  are  protected,  consistent  with  the  principles  that  originated  in  the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical study data are credible. 

15.2.2. 

Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional 
Review Board (IEC/IRB) 

Before the start of the study, the investigator (or sponsor where required) will 
provide  the  IEC/IRB  with  current  and  complete  copies  of  the  following 
documents: 

•  final protocol and, if applicable, amendments 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

118

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

•  sponsor-approved informed consent form (and any other written materials 

to be provided to the subjects) 

•  Investigator’s Brochure (or equivalent information) and amendments 
•  sponsor-approved subject recruiting materials 
•  information  on  compensation  for  study-related  injuries  or  payment  to 

subjects for participation in the study, if applicable 

•  investigator’s  curriculum  vitae  or  equivalent  information  (unless  not 

required, as documented by IEC/IRB) 

•  information  regarding  funding,  name  of  the  sponsor,  institutional 
affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest, and incentives for subjects 

•  any other documents that the IEC/IRB requests to fulfill its obligation 
This study will be undertaken only after IEC/IRB has given full approval of 
the  final  protocol,  amendments  (if  any),  the  informed  consent  form, 
applicable recruiting materials, and subject compensation programs, and the 
sponsor has received a copy of this approval. This approval letter must be 
dated and must clearly identify the documents being approved. 

IEC/IRB  approval  for  the  additional  genetic  and  proteomic  research 
components  of  the  clinical  study  and  for  the  DNA  informed  consent  form 
must  be  obtained.  IEC/IRB  approval  can  be  obtained  for  the  protocol 
independent  of  approval  for  genetic/proteomic  testing.  A  participating 
investigational  site  is  allowed  to  activate  the  clinical  part  of  the  study  if 
either  IEC/IRB  approval  of  the  pharmacogenomics/proteomics  part  is  still 
pending or has been  refused (while  approval  for the clinical part has been 
provided). 

During the study the investigator (or sponsor where required) will send the 
following documents to  the  IEC/IRB  for their review and  approval, where 
appropriate: 

•  protocol amendments 
•  revision(s) to informed consent form and any other written materials to be 

provided to subjects 

•  if applicable, new or revised subject recruiting materials approved by the 

sponsor 

•  revisions  to  compensation  for  study-related  injuries  or  payment  to 

subjects for participation in the study, if applicable 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

119

 
VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

•  Investigator’s Brochure amendments or new edition(s) 
•  summaries  of  the  status  of  the  study  (at  least  annually  or  at  intervals 

stipulated in guidelines of the IEC/IRB) 

•  reports of adverse events that are serious, unlisted, and associated with the 

investigational drug 

•  new information that may affect adversely the safety of the subjects or the 

conduct of the study 

•  deviations from or changes to the protocol to eliminate immediate hazards 

to the subjects 

•  report of deaths of subjects under the investigator’s care 
•  notification if a new investigator is responsible for the study at the site 
•  any other requirements of the IEC/IRB 
For  protocol  amendments  that  increase  subject  risk,  the  amendment  and 
applicable informed consent form revisions must be submitted promptly to 
the  IEC/IRB  for  review  and  approval  before  implementation  of  the 
change(s). 

At least once a year, the IEC/IRB will be asked to review and reapprove this 
clinical study. This request should be documented in writing. 

At  the  end  of  the  study,  the  investigator  (or  sponsor  where  required)  will 
notify the IEC/IRB about the study completion. 

Informed Consent 

15.2.3. 
Each  subject  (or  a  legally  acceptable  representative)  must  give  written 
consent according to local requirements after the nature of the study has been 
fully explained. The consent form must be signed before performance of any 
study-related  activity.  The  consent  form  that  is  used  must  be  approved  by 
both  the  sponsor  and  by  the  reviewing  IEC/IRB.  The  informed  consent 
should be in accordance with principles that originated in the Declaration of 
Helsinki,  current 
regulatory 
requirements, and sponsor policy. 

ICH  and  GCP  guidelines,  applicable 

Before entry into the study, the investigator or an authorized member of the 
investigational  staff  must  explain  to  potential  subjects  or  their  legally 
acceptable  representatives 
the  aims,  methods,  reasonably  anticipated 
benefits, and potential hazards of the study, and any discomfort it may entail. 

FINAL – 7 February 2008

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they 
may withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that 
choosing not to participate will not affect the care the subject will receive for 
the  treatment  of  his/her  disease.  Subjects  will  be  told  that  alternative 
treatments are available if they refuse to take part and that such refusal will 
not prejudice future treatment. Finally, they will be told that the investigator 
will maintain a subject identification register for the purposes of long-term 
follow  up  if  needed  and  that  their  records  may  be  accessed  by  competent 
authorities and authorized sponsor staff without violating the confidentiality 
of the subject, to the extent permitted by the applicable law(s) or regulations. 
By  signing  the  informed  consent  form  the  subject  or  legally  acceptable 
representative is authorizing such access. 

The subject or legally acceptable representative will be given sufficient time 
to read the informed consent form and the opportunity to ask questions. After 
this  explanation  and  before  entry  to  the  study,  consent  should  be 
appropriately  recorded  by  means  of  either  the  subject’s  or  his/her  legally 
acceptable  representative’s  dated  signature.  After  having  obtained  the 
consent, a copy of the informed consent form must be given to the subject. 

Subjects will also be asked to consent to participate in additional genetic and 
proteomic research components of the study. Refusal to participate will not 
result in ineligibility for the rest of the clinical study unless participation in 
genetic testing is required as an inclusion criterion. After informed consent is 
appropriately  obtained, 
legally  acceptable 
representative  will  sign  and  personally  date  a  separate  DNA  informed 
consent form indicating agreement or refusal to participate in the genetic and 
proteomic testing. A copy of this informed consent form will be given to the 
subject.

If the subject or legally acceptable representative is unable to read or write, 
an  impartial  witness  should  be  present  for  the  entire  informed  consent 
process (which includes reading and explaining all written information) and 
personally date and sign the informed consent form after the oral consent of 
the subject or legally acceptable representative is obtained.

Privacy of Personal Data 

15.2.4. 
The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this 
study  will  be  limited  to  those  data  that  are  necessary  to  investigate  the 
efficacy, safety, quality, and utility of the investigational product(s) used in 
this study. 

These  data  must  be  collected  and  processed  with  adequate  precautions  to 
ensure  confidentiality  and  compliance  with  applicable  data  privacy 
protection laws and regulations. 

The sponsor ensures that the personal data will be 

•  processed fairly and lawfully 
•  collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not  further 

processed in a way incompatible with these purposes 

•  adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to said purposes 
•  accurate and, where necessary, kept current 

Explicit consent for the processing of personal data will be obtained from the 
participating  subject  (or  his/her  legally  acceptable  representative)  before 
collection of data. Such consent should also address the transfer of the data 
to other entities and to other countries. 

The subject has the right to request through the investigator access to his/her 
personal data and the right to request rectification of any data that are  not 
correct or complete. Reasonable steps should be taken to respond to such a 
request, taking into consideration the nature of the request, the conditions of 
the study, and the applicable laws and regulations. 

Appropriate  technical  and  organizational  measures  to  protect  the  personal 
data  against  unauthorized  disclosures  or  access,  accidental  or  unlawful 
destruction,  or  accidental  loss  or  alteration  must  be  put  in  place.  Sponsor 
personnel  whose  responsibilities  require  access  to  personal  data  agree  to 
keep the identity of study subjects confidential. 

For  those  subjects  who  gave  consent  to  store  genetic  samples  for  future 
testing and analysis, their samples and corresponding genotypic and clinical 
data will undergo a procedure to make the samples nonidentifiable and will 
be  stored  in  a  nonidentifiable  format.  Genotypic  and  clinical  data  will  be

held in a separate database with all personal identifiers removed and all links 
to personal identifiers stripped. In this case, genotyping results for individual 
subjects  will  not  be  routinely  reported.  For  the  nonidentifiable  genotyping 
component,  only  group  results  will  be  reported.  The  sponsor  cannot 
undertake  to  make  decisions  regarding  the  significance  of  any  findings 
resulting  from  this  genetic  component,  and  cannot,  therefore,  undertake  to 
provide any genetic counseling. Future genotyping of genes not specified in 
this  protocol  will  be  performed  only  on  nonidentifiable  DNA  samples  and 
only on genes related to the disease or the drug under study in this clinical 
study. 

16.  ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS 
16.1.  Protocol Modifications 

Neither  the  investigator  nor  sponsor  will  modify  this  protocol  without  a 
formal amendment. All protocol amendments must be issued by the sponsor, 
and signed and dated by the investigator. Protocol amendments must not be 
implemented  without  prior  IEC/IRB  approval,  or  when  the  relevant 
competent authority has raised any grounds for non-acceptance, except when 
necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects, in which case the 
amendment  must  be  promptly  submitted  to  the  IEC/IRB  and  relevant 
competent  authority.  When

administrative aspects of the study, the IRB (and IEC where required) only 
needs to be notified. 

involves  only 

the  change(s) 

In situations requiring a departure from the protocol, the investigator or other 
physician  in  attendance  will  contact  the  appropriate  sponsor  representative 
by fax or telephone (see Contact Information pages provided separately). If 
possible, this contact will be made before implementing any departure from 
protocol.  In  all  cases,  contact  with  the  sponsor  must  be  made  as  soon  as 
possible in order to discuss the situation and agree on an appropriate course 
of action. The data recorded in the CRF and source document will reflect any 
departure  from  the  protocol,  and  the  source  documents  will  describe  this 
departure and the circumstances requiring it.

•  photocopy  of  the  site  signature  log,  describing  delegation  of  roles  and 

responsibilities at the start of the study 

•  name and address of any local laboratory conducting tests for the study, 

and a dated copy of current laboratory normal ranges for these tests 

•  local  laboratory  documentation  demonstrating  competence  and  test 

reliability (e.g., accreditation/license), if applicable. 

16.3.  Subject Identification Register and Subject Screening 

Log 
The investigator agrees to complete a subject identification register to permit 
easy identification of each subject during and after the study. This document 
will be reviewed by the sponsor site contact for completeness. 

The subject identification register will be treated as confidential and will be 
filed  by  the  investigator  in  the  trial  center  file.  To  ensure  subject 
confidentiality,  no  copy  will  be  made.  All  reports  and  communications 
relating to the study  will identify subjects by initials and assigned number 
only. 

The investigator must also complete a subject screening log, which reports 
on  all  subjects  who  were  seen  to  determine  eligibility  for  inclusion  in  the 
study. 

16.4.  Case Report Form Completion 

CRFs are provided for each subject in printed format. All printed forms must 
be filled out legibly in black ballpoint pen or typed. The appropriate pages of 
the CRF must be signed and dated by the investigator. 

All  data  relating  to  the  study  must  be  recorded  in  CRFs  prepared  by  the 
sponsor.  Data  must  be  entered  into  CRFs  in  English.  The  CRFs  are  to  be 
completed at the time of the subject’s visit, with the exception of results of 
tests performed outside the investigator’s office, so that they always reflect 
the latest observations on the subjects participating in the study. 

Every effort should be made to ensure that all subjective measurements (e.g., 
pain scale information or other questionnaires) to be recorded on the CRF are 
completed  by 
initial  baseline 
determinations. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the CRFs 
are accurate and correct.

VELCADE: Clinical Protocol 26866138-MMY-3002 – Amendment INT-5 

 

All  CRF  entries,  corrections,  and  alterations  must  be  made  by  the 
investigator  or  other  authorized  study-site  personnel.  Corrections  to  paper 
CRFs must be made in such a way that the original entry is not obscured. 
Correction fluid must NOT be used. The correct data must be inserted, dated, 
and  initialed  by  the 
investigator  or  an  authorized  member  of  the 
investigational staff. The investigational staff must not write on No Carbon 
Required  (NCR)  copies  of  CRFs  left  at  the  investigational  site  once  the 
original is transmitted to the sponsor. Completed CRFs will be continuously 
submitted  according  to  the  sponsor’s  instructions  and  reviewed  by  the 
sponsor to determine their acceptability. If necessary, Data Correction Forms 
(DCFs) will be generated and transmitted to the study site. The investigator 
or an authorized member of the investigational staff must complete, sign, and 
date the DCFs. 

16.5.  Data Quality Assurance 

Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the 
selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study centers, review of 
protocol procedures with the investigator and associated personnel before the 
study, periodic monitoring visits by the sponsor, and direct transmission of 
clinical laboratory data from a central laboratory into the sponsor’s data base. 
Written  instructions  will  be  provided  for  collection,  preparation,  and 
shipment of blood, plasma, and urine samples. Case report form completion 
guidelines  will  be  provided  and  reviewed  with  study  personnel  before  the 
start  of  the  study.  The  sponsor  will  review  CRFs  for  accuracy  and 
completeness  during  on-site  monitoring  visits  and  after  their  return  to  the 
sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or designee, 
as appropriate. The data will be entered into the clinical study database and 
verified for accuracy. 

16.6.  Record Retention 

In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will 
maintain all CRFs and all source documents that support the data collected 
from each subject, as well as all study documents as specified in ICH/GCP 
Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all 
study  documents  as  specified  by  the  applicable  regulatory  requirement(s). 
The  investigator/institution  will  take  measures  to  prevent  accidental  or 
premature destruction of these documents.

Essential  documents  must  be  retained  until  at  least  2 years  after  the  last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no 
pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at 
least  2  years  have  elapsed  since  the  formal  discontinuation  of  clinical 
development  of  the  investigational  product.  These  documents  will  be 
retained  for  a  longer  period  if  required  by  the  applicable  regulatory 
requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of 
the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents 
no longer need to be retained. 

If  the  responsible  investigator  retires,  relocates,  or  for  other  reasons 
withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must 
be  transferred  to  a  person  who  will  accept  the  responsibility.  The  sponsor 
must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. 
Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study 
documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor. 

For  CRFs  completed  on  NCR  paper,  one  copy  is  to  be  retained  in  the 
archives of the sponsor from the country in which the study is performed. A 
second copy must be archived by the investigator. 

If  it  becomes  necessary  for  the  sponsor  or  the  appropriate  regulatory 
authority to review any documentation relating to this study, the investigator 
must permit access to such reports. 

16.7.  Monitoring 

The  sponsor  will  perform  on-site  monitoring  visits  as  frequently  as 
necessary. The monitor will record dates of the visits in a study center visit 
log that will be kept at the site. The first postinitiation visit will usually be 
made  as  soon  as  possible  after  enrollment  has  begun.  At  these  visits,  the 
monitor  will  compare  the  data  entered  into  the  CRFs  with  the  hospital  or 
clinic  records  (source  documents).  The  nature  and  location  of  all  source 
documents  will  be  identified  to  ensure  that  all  sources  of  original  data 
required to complete the CRF are known to the sponsor and investigational 
staff  and  are  accessible  for  verification  by  the  sponsor  site  contact.  If 
electronic  records  are  maintained  at  the  investigational  site,  the  method  of 
verification must be discussed with the investigational staff. At a minimum, 
source  documentation  must  be  available

Patient-reported  outcome  questionnaires  will  be  completed  by  the  subjects 
and  will  be  considered  source  data.  If  data  are  recorded  directly  into  the 
CRF, at a minimum there should be an entry in the medical record that each 
of  the  assessments  was  done  and  by  whom  and  the  date  on  which  it  was 
done. It is recommended that the author of an entry in the source documents 
be identifiable.

relevant  cytogenetics 

For  the  collection  of  cytogenetics  data,  the  cytogeneticist  will  be  asked  to 
transcribe  all 
the  original 
cytogenetics  laboratory  report  to  a  template  cytogenetics  worksheet.  These 
data  will  then  be  transcribed  to  the  CRF.  The  template  cytogenetics 
worksheet and the original cytogenetics laboratory report will be retained as 
source documentation. A copy of the cytogenetics laboratory report will be 
collected with the CRF. 

from 

Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for 
the purpose of verifying that the data recorded in the CRF are consistent with 
the  original  source  data.  Findings  from  this  review  of  CRFs  and  source 
documents  will  be  discussed  with  the  investigational  staff.  The  sponsor 
expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant investigational staff will 
be  available,  the  source  documentation  will  be  available,  and  a  suitable 
environment  will  be  provided  for  review  of  study-related  documents.  The 
monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to 
provide feedback on study conduct. 

If corrections to a CRF are needed after removal of the original CRF copy 
from the investigational site, a DCF will be used.

16.8.  Study Completion/Termination 

Study Completion 

16.8.1. 
The  study  is  considered  completed  with  the  last  visit  of  the  last  subject 
undergoing the study. The final data from the investigational site will be sent 
to the sponsor  (or designee) no more than 14 days  after completion of the 
final subject visit at that site. 

Study Termination 

16.8.2. 
The sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate 
the  study  at  any  time.  Investigational  sites  will  be  closed  upon  study 
completion.  An  investigational  site  is  considered  closed  when  all  required 
documents and study supplies have been collected and a site closure visit has 
been performed. 

The  investigator  may  initiate  site  closure  at  any  time,  provided  there  is 
reasonable  cause  and  sufficient  notice  is  given  in  advance  of  the  intended 
termination.  

Reasons  for  the  early  closure  of  an  investigational  site  by  the  sponsor  or 
investigator, or termination of a study by the sponsor, may include but are 
not limited to: 

•  failure  of  the  investigator  to  comply  with  the  protocol,  the  sponsor’s 

procedures, or GCP guidelines 

•  safety concerns 
•  sufficient data suggesting lack of efficacy 
•  inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator 

 

 

16.9.  On-Site Audits 

Representatives of the sponsor’s clinical quality assurance department may 
visit the site to carry out an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory 
guidelines and company policy. These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection and comparison with the 
CRFs. Subject privacy must, however, be respected. 

Similar  auditing  procedures  may  also  be  conducted  by  agents  of  any 
regulatory body reviewing the results of this study in support of a regulatory 
submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if they 

FINAL – 7 February 2008 

129

have  been  contacted  by  a  regulatory  agency  concerning  an  upcoming 
inspection. 

16.10. Use of Information and Publication 

All  information,  including  but  not  limited  to  information  regarding 
VELCADE  or  the  sponsor’s  operations  (e.g.,  patent  application,  formulas, 
manufacturing  processes,  basic  scientific  data,  prior  clinical  data,  and 
formulation information) supplied by the sponsor to the investigator and not 
previously published, and any data including genetic research data generated 
as  a  result  of  this  study,  are  considered  confidential  and  remains  the  sole 
property of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information 
in  confidence  and  use  this  information  only  to  accomplish  this  study,  and 
will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor’s prior written consent. 

The  investigator  understands  that  the  information  developed  in  the  clinical 
study  will  be  used  by  the  sponsor  in  connection  with  the  continued 
development of VELCADE, and thus may be disclosed as required to other 
clinical  investigators  or  regulatory  agencies.  To  permit  the  information 
derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to 
provide the sponsor with all data obtained in the study. 

The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated 
by the sponsor and will contain all data from all investigational sites. Results 
from  any  candidate  gene  analysis  performed  in  the  future  on  identifiable 
samples  will  be  reported  separately  from  the  Clinical  Study  Report.  After 
samples have been made nonidentifiable, only group results will be reported. 
Any  work  created  in  connection  with  performance  of  the  study  and 
contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any 
publication by the investigator as provided for below) shall be the property 
of the sponsor as author and owner of copyright in such work. 

Sponsor  shall  have  the  right  to  publish  such  data  and  information  without 
approval  from  the  investigator.  If  an  investigator  wishes  to  publish 
information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the 
sponsor  for  review  at  least  60 days  before  submission  for  publication  or 
presentation.  Expedited  reviews  will  be  arranged  for  abstracts,  poster 
presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in writing, the 
investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days to

allow  for  filing  of  a  patent  application.  In  the  event  that  issues  arise 
regarding  scientific  integrity  or  regulatory  compliance,  the  sponsor  will 
review  these  issues  with  the  investigator.  The  sponsor  will  not  mandate 
modifications  to  scientific  content  and  does  not  have  the  right  to  suppress 
information.  The  investigator  will  recognize  the  integrity  of  a  multicenter 
study  by  not  publishing  data  derived  from  the  individual  site  until  the 
combined  results  from  the  completed  study  have  been  published  in  full, 
within 12 months after conclusion, abandonment, or termination of the study 
at  all  sites,  or  the  sponsor  confirms  there  will  be  no  multicenter  study 
publication.  Authorship  of  publications  resulting  from  this  study  will  be 
based on generally accepted criteria for major medical journals.

Guidelines for the Use of Concomitant Supportive Therapies 

Attachment 6: 

Guidelines for the Use of Colony Stimulating Factors 
Detailed  guidelines  for  the  use  of  colony  stimulating  factors  have  been  developed  by  the  American 
Society 
at 
http://www.asco.org/prof/pp/html/guide/color/m_colorintro.htm.  These  guidelines  are  appropriate  for 
patients with advanced multiple myeloma. The use of colony-stimulating factors is not expected to be 
common in this study.  

Oncology 

available 

Clinical 

of 

(ASCO) 

and 

are 

online 

The use of growth factors should be considered in the following circumstances: 

•  For patients with febrile neutropenia whose illness is complicated by prolonged (>10 days) fever, 

pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, sinusitis, hypotension, multi-organ dysfunction, invasive fungal 
infection, and uncontrolled progression of myeloma. 

•  For patients with an ANC less than 100/µL, especially if the patient is elderly (greater than 

65 years) or immunosuppressed (severely lymphopenic) or has extensive mucosal damage and/or 
advancing disease. 

•  For patients who experience recurrence of Grade 4 neutropenia despite dose reduction or who 

experienced a high rate of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression associated with their 
previous therapy or previously received large field radiation. 

If determined to be necessary, commercially available growth factors are to be administered according 
to the manufacturer’s prescribing information, as follows: 

•  Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 µg/kg/day. 
•  Granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 250 µg/m2 per day. 
The routine use of growth factors is discouraged. Furthermore, growth factors should not be used in the 
following circumstances: 

•  To increase the treatment regimen’s dose intensity. 
•  To increase the patient’s ANC in order to meet the protocol entrance criteria. 
•  To increase the ANC in patients with afebrile neutropenia. 
Guidelines for Recombinant Human Erythropoietin 
Anemia is an important feature of multiple myeloma and is multifactoral in etiology. It is important to 
have  safe  and  effective  ways  to  increase  the  hematocrit  and  reduce  the  transfusion  requirements  in 
these patients.  

It is expected that the majority of patients enrolled in this study will be treated with rHuEPO. The use 
of rHuEPO should be considered in the following circumstances: 

• 

If the patient is receiving rHuEPO at the time of enrollment in the study, then treatment may 
continue while participating in the study.  
If the patient has a hemoglobin value <11 g/dL. 

• 
Erythropoietin  alfa  (e.g.,  PROCRIT®,  EPREX®,  EPOGEN®)  is  to  be  administered  according  to  the 
manufacturer’s recommendations, as described in the prescribing information [e.g., at a dose ranging 
from 150 to 300 units/kg 3 times weekly (TIW)] or according to published guidelines for patients with 
multiple myeloma (e.g., at a dose of 40,000 units weekly). Dose adjustments may have to be made to 
achieve a target hemoglobin.

Attachment 6: (Continued) 

Guidelines for the Use of Concomitant Supportive Therapies 

 

Guidelines for Platelet Transfusions 
Thrombocytopenia can occur as a consequence of bone marrow infiltration by myeloma cells or may 
be related to study drug administration. The clinical significance of thrombocytopenia experienced by 
a patient should be assessed in light of its etiology (treatment-related or disease-disease or both), the 
state of the underlying myeloma (stable versus worsening disease), and whether the patient is bleeding 
or being prepared for a surgical procedure.  

The use of any platelet product should be considered in the following circumstances. 

• 

• 

•  As preparation for an invasive surgical procedure, transfuse in order to maintain a platelet count 

>50 × 109/L to prevent bleeding.  
If the patient has an active infection, high fever, rapid decrease in platelet count to ≤20 × 109/L 
and/or coagulopathy, transfuse to maintain a platelet count >20 × 109/L as prophylaxis for 
spontaneous bleeding.  
If the patient is actively bleeding or has a platelet count below 10 × 109/L, transfuse in order to 
maintain a platelet count >10 × 109/L  
Guidelines for Red Cell Transfusions 
The use of any red cell product should be considered in the following circumstances. 

If the patient has a hemoglobin <7 g/dL, transfuse to maintain a hemoglobin >8 g/dL in order to 
reduce the risk of inadequate oxygenation.  
If the patient is asymptomatic and has a hemoglobin between ≥7 and ≤8 g/dL, the investigator may 
consider transfusion on a per-patient basis in order to maintain a hemoglobin >8 g/dL.  
If the patient is actively bleeding or has symptomatic cardiac or pulmonary disease or other 
extenuating circumstances where oxygenation is impaired, the investigator may elect to transfuse 
on a per-patient basis. In these instances, the trigger hemoglobin value may be >8 g/dL.

Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection and Handling 

Attachment 7:  

Materials and Labeling  
Blood must be collected in tubes containing K3EDTA as the anticoagulant. Resulting plasma samples 
must be stored in polypropylene storage tubes with polypropylene or polyethylene caps. No tubes with 
separation gel should be used. 

The central laboratory will provide the investigational site with blood collection tubes, storage tubes, 
preprinted labels (or tubes labeled with preprinted labels), and related supplies for the collection and 
shipment of pharmacokinetic samples. Detailed information will be provided in the laboratory manual 
from the central laboratory. 

Preparation of Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples  
• 

It is very important that PK samples are kept on ice at all times. 

•  Blood samples for PK sampling should be collected from the arm contralateral (i.e., opposite arms 

should be used for PK sampling and VELCADE administration. 

•  Collect 4 mL of blood into a collection tube with K3EDTA as the anticoagulant (e.g., Vacutainer®) 

at each time point. 

•  Record  the  exact  date  and  time  of  sampling  in  the  CRF  or  laboratory  requisition  form,  as 

appropriate. 

•  Gently invert the tubes 5 to 6 times to afford mixing, before processing. 

• 

Immediately put the blood samples on melting ice. 

•  Centrifuge blood samples within 1 hour of collection in a clinical centrifuge at 1000 g (about 
2500–3000 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4ºC to yield at least 2 mL of plasma from each 4 mL whole 
blood sample. 

•  Transfer all separated plasma immediately with a clean, disposable glass or polyethylene pipette 

(use 1 new pipette per sample) to a pre-labeled storage tube. 

•  Store plasma samples in an upright position, at –80°C or lower until transfer to the central 

laboratory. 

•  The time between blood collection and freezing the plasma will not exceed 2 hours. 
•  Ship specimens according to the instructions provided. 
•  Questions regarding handling the plasma pharmacokinetic specimens should be addressed to the 

contact person for the sponsor.

Labeling Instructions for Pharmacokinetic Samples 

Attachment 8: 

 
 
STRUCTURE OF THE LABEL: 
1. Each label has two identical parts. Please 
complete all of the requested information 
(current date, time of sample, etc.), on both 
label parts. 

2. The backing of the label and the label itself 

are perforated. 

 

 
 
STEP 1: After the Vacutainer® has been 
filled, remove part 1 of the label and 
completely attach it to the Vacutainer®, 
lengthwise. Centrifuge the Vacutainer®. 

 

 
 
STEP 2: Remove part 2 of the label and attach it to 
the empty plasma collecting tube. The label must be 
attached to the tube lengthwise. You are now able to 
match the alphanumeric code, subject identification, 
and time point on the plasma collecting tube with the 
corresponding information on the Vacutainer®. After 
the tubes are matched, the plasma may be transferred 
from the Vacutainer® to the plasma collecting tube. 

 
 
 
 
STEP 3: Freeze the sample in an upright position.  
Pack and ship the samples as instructed in the protocol.

Attachment 9: 

Shipment of Pharmacokinetic Samples 

All pharmacokinetic samples will be sent to the central laboratory at the intervals agreed upon. The 
laboratory  manual  from the central laboratory provides details regarding packaging and shipment of 
the samples. The following guidelines will be followed: 

•  For all international shipments, 

 (tel. number: 

) will be used. 

For domestic shipments, a domestic courier, as recommended by the central laboratory will be 
used. 

•  Notify central laboratory and 

 (tel. number: 

hours in advance of the planned shipment. Provide
number to be used, if applicable. 

), at least 24 

 with the appropriate account 

•  Place the frozen samples for each subject in the appropriate containers, as specified in the central 

laboratory manual. 

•  Pack the frozen samples in sufficient quantity of dry ice, to maintain a frozen state for at least 

3 days. 

•  Avoid direct contact between sample bags and dry ice, by separating them with a dry ice resistant 

material (e.g., newspaper). 

•  For all biological samples, follow the IATA regulations for shipment. 
•  Ensure that the total package weight does not exceed 27.2 kg (60 pounds). 
•  Label the package with the study number and all other information required by the central 

laboratory. 
Include a return address (which includes the investigator’s name) on the outside of each shipping 
container. 

• 

•  Comply with all courier regulations for the shipment of biological specimens (include all 

paperwork). 

•  Retain all documents indicating date, time and signature/s of person/people making the shipment, 

in the study files. 

Samples  should  be  shipped  via  overnight  delivery  only  on  Monday  through  Wednesday,  excluding 
holidays.  As  soon  as  shipment  day  and  air  bill  number/s  are  available,  the  site  will  call  or  fax  the 
central laboratory. The call or fax  must specify the study  number, number of packages shipped, the 
number of pharmacokinetic samples, and the time of shipment pick-up. 

Samples must be sent to the name and address indicated in the central laboratory manual. 

*NOTE: If there are changes regarding the courier or location to which samples are shipped during the 
course  of  the  clinical  study,  written  notification  will  be  provided  to  the  Investigator  and  will  not 
require (a) protocol amendment(s).

Pharmacogenomic Sample Collection and Shipment Procedure 

 
Supplies and Preparation of Pharmacogenomic Samples 
The  central  laboratory  will  provide  the  investigational  site  with  pre-labeled  EDTA  collection  tubes. 
Detailed information is provided in the laboratory manual from the central laboratory. 

Pharmacogenomic samples should be prepared as follows: 

Invert the tube 10 to 15 times immediately after collection, to prevent coagulation. 

• 
•  DO NOT centrifuge the sample 
•  Blood samples collected and shipped within 24 hours can be shipped at ambient temperature (see 

sample shipment below) 

•  When there is a delay of more than 24 hours between collection and shipment, samples should be 

stored at 4ºC at the investigational site for at most 5 calendar days, and shipped in ambient or 
cooled condition (but not on dry ice). Freezing of the blood samples should be avoided. 

Pharmacogenomic Sample Shipment 
Samples must be sent to the name and address indicated in the central laboratory manual. 

Once  collected,  the  blood  samples  should  be  shipped  within  24  hours  to  the  central  laboratory. 
Detailed information will be provided in the laboratory manual from the central laboratory. In general, 
the following guidelines should be adhered to: 

• 

If possible, ambient/cooled shipment should be arranged with other clinical trial samples. If this is 
not possible, a separate shipment for these blood samples should be organized, using the courier 
recommended by the central laboratory. 

•  Notify courier (as specified in study manual), at least 24 hours in advance of the planned 
shipment. Provide courier with the appropriate account number to be used, if applicable. 

•  DO NOT package the samples in dry ice. 
•  Label the package with the trial number and all other information required by the central 

laboratory. 
Include a return address (which includes the investigator’s name) on the outside of each shipping 
container. 

• 

•  Comply with all courier regulations for the shipment of biological specimens (include all 

paperwork). 

•  Retain all documents indicating date, time and signature/s of person/people making the shipment, 

in the study files. 

•  The blood samples should be shipped to the name and address indicated in the central laboratory 

manual.

Proteomic Sample Collection and Shipment Procedure  

Attachment 14: 

Materials and Labeling 
Blood  must  be  collected  in  SST  (serum  separator  tubes)  polypropylene  tubes.  The  resulting  serum 
samples must be stored in polypropylene storage tubes with polypropylene or polyethylene caps. 

The central laboratory will provide the investigational site with blood collection tubes, storage tubes, 
preprinted labels (or tubes labeled with preprinted labels), and related supplies for the collection and 
shipment  of  proteomic  samples.  The  serum  storage  tubes  must  be  made  of  polypropylene  or 
polyethylene only.  

Detailed information will be provided in the laboratory manual from the central laboratory.  

Preparation of Serum Proteomic Samples  
•  Collect 10 mL of blood into SST plastic vacutainer red-gray top tube, BD#367985 at each time 

point. Acceptable alternative collection tubes include BD#367988 and BD#367991.  

•  Record the date and time of sampling in the CRF or laboratory requisition form, as appropriate. 
•  Gently invert the tubes 5 times immediately after drawing and let clot for 30 minutes at room 

temperature. 

•  Centrifuge blood samples in a clinical centrifuge at 1000 x g (about 2500–3000 rpm) for 

10 minutes. A barrier will form, separating the serum specimen from the clot. Expected yield is at 
least 5 mL of serum from each 10 mL whole blood sample. 

•  Transfer all separated serum immediately with a clean, disposable glass or polyethylene pipette 

(use 1 new pipette per sample) to a prelabeled storage tube. 

•  Store serum samples in an upright position, at -70°C until transfer to central laboratory. 
•  The time between blood collection and freezing the serum will not exceed 2 hours. 
•  Ship specimens according to the instructions provided. 
•  Questions regarding handling the serum proteomics specimens should be addressed to the contact 

person for the sponsor. 

All  proteomic  samples  will  be  sent  to  the  central  laboratory  at  the  intervals  agreed  upon.  The 
laboratory  manual  from the central laboratory provides details regarding packaging and shipment of 
the samples. The following guidelines will be followed: 

•  For all international shipments, 

 (tel. number: 

) will be used. 

For domestic shipments, a domestic courier, as recommended by the central laboratory will be 
used. 

•  Notify central laboratory and courier (as specified in study manual) at least 24 hours in advance of 
the planned shipment. Provide courier (as specified in study manual) with the appropriate account 
number to be used, if applicable. 

•  Place the frozen samples for each subject in the appropriate containers, as specified in the central 

laboratory manual.

Proteomic Sample Collection and Shipment Procedure  

•  Pack the frozen samples in sufficient quantity of dry ice, to maintain a frozen state for at least 

3 days. 

•  Avoid direct contact between sample bags (if ziploc freezer bags are to be used) and dry ice, by 

separating them with a dry ice resistant material (e.g., newspaper). 

•  Ensure that the total package weight does not exceed 27.2 kg (60 pounds). 
•  Label the package with the trial number and all other information required by the central 

laboratory. 
Include a return address (which includes the investigator’s name) on the outside of each shipping 
container. 

• 

•  Comply with all courier regulations for the shipment of biological specimens (include all 

paperwork). 

•  Retain all documents indicating date, time, and signature/s of person/people making the shipment, 

in the study files. 

•  Sample will be stored at –70°C at the central laboratory until sponsor requests shipment 
Samples  should  be  shipped  via  overnight  delivery  only  on  Monday  through  Wednesday,  excluding 
holidays.  As  soon  as  shipment  day  and  air  bill  number/s  are  available,  the  site  will  call  or  fax  the 
central  laboratory.  The  call  or  fax  must  specify  the  trial  number,  number  of  packages  shipped,  the 
number of proteomic samples, and the time of shipment pick-up. 

Samples must be sent to the name and address indicated in the central laboratory manual. 

 
*NOTE: If there are changes regarding the courier or location to which samples are shipped during the 
course  of  the  clinical  study,  written  notification  will  be  provided  to  the  Investigator  and  will  not 
require (a) protocol amendment(s).
