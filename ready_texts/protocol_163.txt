Study design 

This is a parallel group, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-
center study design to assess whether the addition of ZACTIMA (100 mg daily) to docetaxel 
in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC confers a statistically significant 
advantage in terms of PFS. 

Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ZACTIMA 100 mg plus docetaxel, or 
placebo plus docetaxel.  No stratification at randomization will be made for this study.  
Docetaxel will be administered according to a 21-day cycle, up to a maximum of 6 cycles.  
ZACTIMA or placebo will be administered as a once daily tablet.  Subjects may continue to 
receive study treatment as long as they are benefiting from treatment (in the Investigator’s 
opinion, and they do not meet any other withdrawal criteria).  There is a maximum of 6 cycles 
of docetaxel and no maximum duration of treatment for ZACTIMA/placebo.  After 6 cycles of 
docetaxel, subjects will continue on ZACTIMA or placebo monotherapy until progression.  
Blinded ZACTIMA/placebo should not be combined with any other anti-cancer therapies, and 
should be discontinued following objective disease progression. The safety data from all 
subjects will be assessed on an ongoing basis. 

Radiologic evaluation using RECIST will be performed at screening and then every 6 weeks 
after randomization.  It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible.  
Subjects will be evaluated until objective disease progression, and will then be followed for 
survival, unless they withdraw consent.  If a subject discontinues study medication prior to 
objective disease progression they should continue to be assessed by RECIST, as per the 
protocol schedule, until disease progression and then followed up for survival, unless they 
withdraw consent. 

PK samples will be obtained from 440 subjects, and all Japanese subjects, for a total of 580 
subjects randomized in the study. 

Every attempt will be made to obtain archived tumor samples from all subjects randomized on 
the study, although tissue collection will not be mandatory.

Study Code D4200C00032

Target subject population 

Male and female subjects aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically 
confirmed locally advanced or metastatic (IIIb-IV) NSCLC after failure of 1st line anti-cancer 
therapy and who have a performance status of 0 to 1 (WHO, Miller et al 1981). 

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration 

ZACTIMA (1 x 100 mg in tablet form) or matching placebo will be dosed orally, once daily, 
preferably at the same time of day each morning. 

Subjects who experience Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 
3 or 4 toxicity that is considered related to ZACTIMA/placebo will have their trial medication 
stopped until resolution of the toxicity.  When the toxicity has recovered to CTCAE grade 1 
(or baseline), the subject may restart treatment with a reduced dose of ZACTIMA in a blinded 
manner.  The study evaluations should be continued as outlined in the trial plan.  If the subject 
has been off treatment for greater than 3 weeks due to toxicity, the subject must be withdrawn 
from ZACTIMA/placebo.  In the case of subjects who discontinue ZACTIMA/placebo 
therapy because of toxicity attributable to ZACTIMA/placebo, these subjects will continue to 
receive the scheduled treatment with docetaxel and will be followed for progression and 
survival. 

Docetaxel, dosage and mode of administration 
Docetaxel, the registered, approved dose (60 mg/m2 Japan only; 75 mg/m2 all other countries), 
administered intravenously over at least a 1-hour period every 21 days. 

Subjects should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, 8mg twice 
daily for 3 days starting 1 day before each administration of docetaxel.  Investigators may 
choose an alternative corticosteroid premedication in accordance with approved local practice.  
In the event that the subject forgets to take the oral corticosteroid prior to Day 1 of each cycle, 
an IV dose can be given at the discretion of the Investigator.  Additional doses of the IV 
dexamethasone, or alternative corticosteroid, can be given at the Investigator’s discretion. 

Subjects who experience CTCAE grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is considered related to docetaxel 
will have docetaxel stopped until resolution of the toxicity.  When the toxicity has recovered 
to CTCAE grade 1 (or baseline), the subject may restart treatment with a reduced dose of 
docetaxel.  If docetaxel must be withheld for more than 3 weeks, after a scheduled treatment 
visit, for resolution of toxicity, the subject will not restart docetaxel treatment.  In the case of 
subjects who discontinue combination therapy because of toxicity attributable to docetaxel, 
subjects may continue on ZACTIMA/placebo and will be followed for progression and 
survival. 

Duration of treatment 

Docetaxel will be administered according to a 21-day cycle.  ZACTIMA/placebo will be 
administered as a once daily tablet.  Subjects may continue to receive study treatment as long 
as they are benefiting from treatment (in the Investigator’s opinion, and they do not meet any 
other withdrawal criteria).  There is a maximum of 6 cycles of docetaxel and no maximum

duration of treatment for ZACTIMA/placebo. After 6 cycles of docetaxel, subjects will 
continue on ZACTIMA/placebo monotherapy until progression. Blinded ZACTIMA/placebo 
should not be combined with any other anti-cancer therapies, and should be discontinued 
following objective disease progression.

Statistical methods 

There will be two co-primary analysis populations:  the first will comprise all subjects; the 
second will comprise all female subjects.  Therefore, a nominal 2-sided significance level of 
2.5% will be used for all analyses, except for the primary endpoint of PFS and the secondary 
endpoint of overall survival, where the nominal significance will be adjusted to approximately 
2.44% to allow for a single interim analysis. 

In order to detect a 25% prolongation of overall PFS with >90% power at the 2-sided 2.44% 
significance level, a minimum of 1176 progression events are required.  Assuming a median 
PFS of 3 months for docetaxel alone, a recruitment period of 19 months and minimum follow-
up of 3 months, a minimum of 1380 subjects with locally advanced or metastatic (IIIb-IV) 
NSCLC after failure of 1st line anti-cancer therapy will be enrolled.  The prior regimen must 
have failed the subject because of unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease. 

A single interim analysis to assess futility and superiority of the PFS and overall survival 
endpoints will be performed when a minimum of 588 PFS events have occurred (using a 
nominal significance level of 0.14%). 

The analysis of survival will be conducted at the time of analysis of the primary endpoint of 
PFS.  It is estimated that 850 events (deaths) will have occurred at this time, in which case the 
power to detect a 25% prolongation of survival would be >80%. 

PFS, overall survival (OS), TDS, and TDPS will be analyzed using a log-rank test.  ORR and 
DCR will be analyzed using logistic regression. 

Safety and tolerability will be assessed in terms of AEs, laboratory data, vital signs, and ECG 
changes which will be collected for all subjects.  AEs (both in terms of Medical dictionary for 
regulatory activities [MedDRA] preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually 
by subject and summarized by treatment group.

In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed on the PFS and OS.  The subgroups to be 
analyzed will include tumor stage, number of organs involved, prior Avastin™ (bevacizumab) 
therapy, histology, smoking history, gender, ethnic origin, EGFR expression and EGFR 
mutation status.

INTRODUCTION 

Investigators should be familiar with the ZACTIMA™ (ZD6474) Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB). 

1.1 

1.1.1 

Background 

Tumor angiogenesis 

Therapies that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels, so called angiogenesis inhibitors, offer 
considerable promise as anticancer agents.  The link between angiogenesis and tumor 
progression and spread was first established some 30 years ago by Judah Folkman (Folkman, 
1971).  Folkman noted that without new blood vessels, many tumors only grow to a few 
millimeters in size.  He also found that while a tumor may remain small, its cells continue to 
proliferate, a situation brought about by a balance between cell rate of proliferation and 
apoptosis (programmed cell death).  These observations led to the concept of an “angiogenic 
switch”, a complex process by which a tumor mass expands and overtakes the rate of internal 
apoptosis by developing blood vessels, thereby changing into an angiogenic phenotype.  
Evidence has emerged that suggests this change is a result of a shift in net balance of 
stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment in which the 
inhibitors are down regulated (Hanahan et al, 1996).  It is now recognized that the growth of 
most solid tumors and the formation of metastases are dependent on this process. 

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to play a pivotal role in tumor 
angiogenesis (Stacker et al, 1999).  VEGF is a mitogen for vascular endothelial cells derived 
from arteries, veins, and lymphatics and induces a strong angiogenic response in a variety of 
in vivo models; it also functions as a survival factor for endothelial cells (Leung et al, 1989; 
Ferrara, 1999).  In addition, it has been proposed that a major function of VEGF is the 
induction of plasma protein leakage because of its ability to induce vascular leakage (Dvorak 
et al, 1995).  Other properties of VEGF include promotion of monocyte chemotaxis, inhibition 
of functional maturation of dendritic cells, and vasodilatation (Ferrara, 1999).  The discovery 
of VEGF was followed by the identification of specific VEGF receptors (VEGFR) that 
constituted a new subfamily of tyrosine-kinase receptors (Neufeld et al, 1999).  Of the 2 
receptors identified on endothelial cells, only signaling of VEGFR2 (Kinase insert domain 
receptor [KDR]) was found to induce endothelial cell proliferation.  Most solid tumors express 
high levels of VEGF, and the VEGF receptors appear predominantly in endothelial cells of 
vessels surrounding or penetrating the malignant tissue (Siemeister et al, 1998).  Interestingly, 
a correlation between VEGF expression and prognosis has been noted for several cancers 
(Gasparini et al, 1997; Maeda et al, 1996).  Increased levels of VEGF expression in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells are associated with poor prognosis, local invasion, advanced 
stage, and lymph node involvement (Niklinska et al 2001, Shou et al 2001).  The importance 
of VEGF in tumor angiogenesis was revealed in experiments of abrogation of VEGF activity 
by neutralizing antibodies or by the introduction of dominant negative VEGF receptors into

endothelial cells of tumor-associated blood vessels.  This resulted in inhibition of tumor 
growth and in tumor regression (Kim et al, 1993; Millauer et al, 1994). 

In many cases, prevention of angiogenesis by VEGF receptor inhibition will be cytostatic.  
Therefore, the combination of anti-angiogenesis agents with cytotoxic chemotherapy may 
provide the ideal effect on tumor killing. 

1.1.2 

ZACTIMA™ (ZD6474) 

1.1.2.1  Background 

ZACTIMA is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase domain of the VEGF receptor-2 (KDR or 
VEGFR2).  It is expected that this molecule may be beneficial in a broad range of human 
malignancies, and perhaps other diseases, that are dependent upon VEGF-mediated 
angiogenesis.  ZACTIMA has shown excellent reversible inhibition of tumor cell growth in a 
broad range of pre-clinical models, including lung cancer xenografts.  Regression of some 
established tumors in animals were observed following oral administration.  Pre-clinical 
toxicology shows the agent to be well tolerated after 6 months of daily administration.  
ZACTIMA also inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, though 
at an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 500 nanomolar (nM), which was higher than that for 
VEGFR2 (40 nM) (Ciardiello et al, 2003; Wedge et al, 2002).  Two Phase I studies were 
conducted in the West and in Japan, which demonstrated a maximum tolerated dose of 300 
mg, with common adverse events (AEs) being diarrhea, rash, and asymptomatic QTc 
prolongation.  Subsequently, a randomized double-blind study was conducted to compare 
ZACTIMA at 100 mg or 300 mg in combination with docetaxel to docetaxel plus placebo.  
The results of this study demonstrated that ZACTIMA combined with docetaxel prolonged 
progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects with NSCLC. 

1.1.2.2  Summary of adverse events (AEs) in previous studies 

Please refer to the latest IB for the most up to date information. 

The most common AEs associated with ZACTIMA in the phase I and other monotherapy 
studies included rash, diarrhea and asymptomatic QTc prolongation.  In Study 6474IL/0006, 
subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC were enrolled after failure of prior platinum-
based chemotherapy.  Subjects were randomized to treatment with a standard dose of 
docetaxel and either placebo or 100 mg of ZACTIMA or 300 mg of ZACTIMA.  The median 
duration of therapy for each arm (docetaxel/placebo, docetaxel /ZACTIMA 100 mg, and 
docetaxel /ZACTIMA 300 mg) was 65 days, 91days, and 61.5 days, respectively.  More 
subjects discontinued therapy as a result of AEs for those who received 300 mg ZACTIMA 
(22.7%) compared to those who received 100 mg (4.8%) or placebo (12.6%). 

The AE profile was similar for all three treatment arms, although somewhat higher 
frequencies were observed for the 100 mg ZACTIMA arm compared with placebo, and for the 
300 mg ZACTIMA arm compared with 100 mg ZACTIMA.

The most frequent AEs observed in this study were similar to those observed in prior trials for 
ZACTIMA or reported for docetaxel in the literature.  The most common AEs and their 
frequencies as reported in the 300 mg ZACTIMA, 100 mg ZACTIMA and placebo arms, 
respectively, were diarrhea (50.0%, 38.1%, 24.4%), fatigue (45.5%, 40.5%, 26.8%), 
neutropenia (31.8%, 26.2%, 19.5%) and nausea (29.5%, 26.2%, 19.5%).  Rash was observed 
in 15.9%, 16.7% and 9.8% of subjects in the three arms. 

Gastrointestinal events (77.3%, 59.5%, 41.5%), and skin events (72.7%, 64.3%, 41.5%) were 
more common in the ZACTIMA-containing arms.  For all arms the majority of these events 
were common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 1 and 2; however CTC grade 3/4 event were more 
prominent in the ZACTIMA 300 mg arm.  Cardiac disorders occurred more frequently in 
ZACTIMA-containing arms (15.9%, 14.3%, 2.4%).  The majority were CTC grade 1/2 and 
included a variety of terms, none ventricular.  The frequency of respiratory events (50.0%, 
57.1%, 46.3%) was similar in all arms.  Neutropenia (31.8%, 26.2%, 19.5%) and related terms 
were more common in ZACTIMA-containing arms, but this did not result in an increase in 
infection.  There was little difference in frequency of other hematologic events. 

Approximately 10% of subjects receiving ZACTIMA developed an AE of hypertension.  The 
majority of events were CTC grade 1 or 2, and no events were CTC grade 4.  There were no 
serious adverse events (SAEs) of hypertension.  The maximum median rise in both systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure was approximately 8 mm Hg in subjects who received 
ZACTIMA 300 mg, and approximately 4 mm Hg in subjects who received ZACTIMA 100 
mg. 

For the analysis of AEs that might have been caused by QT prolongation, AstraZeneca 
utilized the broad Special Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query 
(SMQ) for QT prolongation.  The terms queried included electrocardiogram (ECG) QT 
corrected interval prolonged, ECG QT interval abnormal, ECG QT prolonged, long QT 
syndrome, long QT syndrome congenital, Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia, 
cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, sudden death, cardiac arrest, cardiac fibrillation, 
cardiorespiratory arrest, ECG repolarization abnormality, ECG J wave abnormality, ECG U-
wave abnormality, loss of consciousness, syncope, syncope vasovagal, ventricular arrhythmia, 
ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular flutter.  The only event that was actually reported in the 
randomized phase was ECG QT (corrected) interval prolonged, which occurred in 7, 5, and 2 
subjects treated with ZACTIMA 300 mg, ZACTIMA 100 mg, and placebo, respectively. 

In addition, AstraZeneca reviewed the data for subjects who experienced a confirmed 
prolongation of the ECG QTc interval, as specified in the protocol.  Seven subjects had 
confirmed QTc prolongation in this study.  Five occurred on the ZACTIMA 300 mg/docetaxel 
arm, 4 of which occurred in the first 28 days and 1 at day 70.  Two occurred on the 
ZACTIMA 100 mg /docetaxel arm, at days 22 and 43.  No subjects with confirmed QTc 
prolongation in study 6474IL/0006 experienced a potentially relevant AE.  One subject in the 
run-in phase of trial 6 had received ZACTIMA 300 mg plus docetaxel, was hospitalized with 
a post-obstructive pneumonia as well as hypokalemia resulting from prednisone and fluorinef 
given to treat adrenal insufficiency resulting from adrenal metastases.  He was noted to have a

QTc interval of 626 milliseconds (msec).  During this hospitalization he developed a 12 beat 
run of ventricular tachycardia, which was asymptomatic and resolved without treatment.   

1.1.3 

Docetaxel (TAXOTERE™, Sanofi-Aventis) 

Docetaxel (TAXOTERE™, Sanofi-Aventis) is indicated for the treatment of subjects with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy.  At a 
dose of 75 mg/m2, docetaxel had a significant beneficial effect on overall survival compared 
with best supportive care, and a significantly higher 1 year survival compared to the control 
arm of vinorelbine or ifosfamide (Shepherd et al 2000, Fossella et al 2000).  Expected 
toxicities include hypersensitivity reactions, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, and fluid 
retention.  The incidence of severe fluid retention can be reduced by treatment with oral 
corticosteroids such as dexamethasone for 3 days beginning the day before docetaxel 
administration.  Investigators may choose an alternative corticosteroid premedication in 
accordance with approved local practice.  Dexamethasone, or alternative corticosteroid, 
should be given orally.  Additional doses of IV dexamethasone, or alternative corticosteroid, 
can be given at the Investigator’s discretion.  Prescribing information may vary between 
countries and should be confirmed with the local dispensary or with the manufacturer at the 
address given in Appendix H. 

1.2 

Rationale for this study 

The outlook for subjects with refractory advanced NSCLC is poor, with a median survival of 
approximately 6 months at time of failed first treatment. 

There are now several reports on the use of novel targeted therapies with unique mechanisms 
of action, which have provided proof of the concept in the clinical trials.  Avastin™ 
(bevacizumab), an anti-VEGF recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (rhuMAb), 
showed improved efficacy in stage IIIb/IV NSCLC when combined with 
paclitaxel/carboplatin (Sandler AB et al, 2005) and in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) when 
combined with Irinotecan/5 Fluorouracil/Leucovorin (Hurwitz H et al, 2004).  Agents such as 
EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (eg, Tarceva™), and anti-EGFR monoclonal 
antibodies (MAbs) (eg Erbitux™) have shown efficacy in refractory NSCLC and refractory 
CRC, respectively. 

Combination therapies have been reported with these novel agents.  Herbst et al reported on a 
Phase I/II trial of Avastin and Tarceva in subjects with NSCLC having shown an increased 
response rate and PFS (Herbst et al, 2005), suggesting that EGFR and VEGFR blockade may 
have significant activity in NSCLC even without chemotherapy. 

ZACTIMA has both EGFR & VEGFR TKI activity.  Hence, ZACTIMA may have potential 
utility as a novel agent containing both EGFR and VEGFR inhibition in one compound. 

In a Japanese ZACTIMA Phase I study with doses ranging from 100 mg to 400 mg, objective 
tumor response was seen from 4 of 9 subjects with NSCLC.  In a Phase II study 
(ZD6474IL/0006), ZACTIMA combined with docetaxel showed prolonged PFS in subjects 
with NSCLC.  In study ZD6474IL/0006 a total of 127 subjects were randomized from 27

centers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and USA.  At the data cut-off of 30 November 2004, 
the median follow-up was approximately 9.5 months and minimum follow-up approximately 
4.5 months.  Treatment groups were generally well balanced for key baseline variables.  The 
overall median age was 59 years; approximately 55% of subjects were male; 90% were 
Caucasian; 50% had adenocarcinoma; 75% had stage IV disease; 90% were current or 
previous smokers; and 65% were performance status 1 (the remainder were performance 
status 0). 

At the data cutoff, approximately 75% of subjects had experienced a progression event, and 
approximately 45% had died.  The estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS (ZACTIMA + 
docetaxel : docetaxel alone) were 0.64 (2-sided 95% CI 0.30-1.05; p=0.07) for ZACTIMA 
100 mg + docetaxel, and 0.83 (2-sided 95% CI 0.50-1.36; p=0.42) for ZACTIMA 300 mg + 
docetaxel.  The estimated median PFSs were 19 weeks for ZACTIMA 100 mg + docetaxel; 17 
weeks for ZACTIMA 300 mg + docetaxel, and 12 weeks for docetaxel alone. 

Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST)-confirmed objective responses (PR 
[partial response]) were observed in 11/42 subjects randomized to ZACTIMA 100 mg + 
docetaxel (26%), in 8/44 subjects randomized to ZACTIMA 300 mg + docetaxel (18%), and 
in 5/41 subjects randomized to docetaxel alone (12%).  Rates of disease control for at least 6 
weeks were 83% for ZACTIMA 100 mg + docetaxel, 64% for ZACTIMA 300 mg + 
docetaxel, and 56% for docetaxel alone. 

The analysis of survival gave estimated HRs (ZACTIMA + docetaxel : docetaxel alone) of 
1.14 (2-sided 95% CI 0.57-2.28; p=0.72) for ZACTIMA 100 mg + docetaxel, and 1.49 
(2-sided 95% CI 0.77-2.88; p=0.24) for ZACTIMA 300 mg + docetaxel.  The median time to 
death could not be estimated for ZACTIMA 100 mg + docetaxel at the time of the data cut-off 
but was estimated as 8.2 months for ZACTIMA 300 mg + docetaxel, and 11.5 months for 
docetaxel alone.  In this study, the addition of ZACTIMA to docetaxel did not confer an 
advantage in terms of survival.  This may be explained, in part, by the immaturity of the data, 
the small sample size and the confounding effects of subsequent cancer therapy.  No 
evidence could be found of a systematic adverse safety effect of ZACTIMA which could 
explain the lack of survival advantage. 

Docetaxel is indicated for the 2nd-line treatment of subjects with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC who have failed platinum-based chemotherapy.  This trial will determine if 
the daily administration of ZACTIMA provides a significant prolongation of PFS when 
compared with docetaxel in combination with placebo in subjects whom have failed a 1st line 
anti-cancer therapy and will include subjects that have not received a platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 

The dose of ZACTIMA in this study was selected following review of the efficacy, safety and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) data to date.  In study 006, the 100 mg dose in combination with 
docetaxel demonstrated superior tolerability compared to the 300 mg dose in combination 
with docetaxel, and was not markedly different from the tolerability of docetaxel plus placebo.  
While both doses of ZACTIMA provided superior efficacy (PFS, response rate) in 
combination with docetaxel compared to docetaxel plus placebo, the 100 mg dose of

ZACTIMA was superior to the 300 mg dose.  Therefore, ZACTIMA 100 mg is the 
appropriate dose for future study in combination with docetaxel. 

Exploratory subgroup analyses of progression and survival data from the previous Phase II 
study (ZD6474IL/0006) have generated a hypothesis that the advantage for ZACTIMA 100 
mg plus docetaxel over docetaxel alone may be most pronounced in female subjects.  In order 
to test this hypothesis, this trial will incorporate two co-primary analysis populations: the first 
will comprise all subjects; the second will comprise all female subjects.  Accordingly, a 
nominal significance level of 2.5% will be used for each of the two analysis populations.

STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 

3.1 

Overall study design and flow chart 

This Clinical Study Protocol has been subjected to a peer review according to AstraZeneca 
standard procedures. 

This is a parallel group, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-
center study design to assess whether the addition of ZACTIMA (100 mg daily) to docetaxel 
in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC confers an advantage in terms of PFS.  
A minimum of 1380 subjects will be enrolled in the clinical study, with 420 subjects in EU 
Directive implementing countries (20 in Austria, 30 in Belgium, 50 in Denmark, 70 in France, 
70 in Germany, 30 in Greece, 50 in Italy, 30 in Netherlands, 30 in Portugal, and 40 in Spain). 

Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ZACTIMA 100 mg plus docetaxel, or 
placebo plus docetaxel.  No stratification at randomization will be made for this study.  
Docetaxel will be administered according to a 21-day cycle up to a maximum of 6 cycles.  
ZACTIMA/placebo will be administered as a once daily tablet.  Subjects may continue to 
receive study treatment as long as they are benefiting from treatment (in the Investigator’s 
opinion and they do not meet any other withdrawal criteria).  There is a maximum of 6 cycles 
of docetaxel and no maximum duration of treatment for ZACTIMA/placebo.  After 6 cycles of 
docetaxel, subjects will continue on ZACTIMA/placebo monotherapy until progression. 
Blinded ZACTIMA/placebo should be discontinued following objective disease progression. 

The safety data from all subjects will be assessed on an ongoing basis.  Subjects who 
experience Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
(Section 3.2.2.) that is considered related to ZACTIMA/placebo will have their trial 
medication stopped until resolution of the toxicity.  When the toxicity has recovered to 
CTCAE grade 1 (or baseline), the subject may restart treatment with a reduced dose of 
ZACTIMA in a blinded manner.  The study evaluations should be continued as outlined in the 
trial plan.  If the subject has been off treatment for greater than 3 weeks due to toxicity, the 
subject must be withdrawn from ZACTIMA/placebo.  In the case of subjects who discontinue 
ZACTIMA/placebo therapy because of toxicity attributable to ZACTIMA/placebo, these 
subjects will continue to receive the scheduled treatment with docetaxel and will be followed 
for progression and survival. 

Subjects who experience CTCAE grade 3 or 4 toxicity (Section 3.2.2) that is considered 
related to docetaxel will have docetaxel stopped until resolution of the toxicity.  When the 
toxicity has recovered to CTCAE grade 1 (or baseline), the subject may restart treatment with 
a reduced dose of docetaxel.  If docetaxel must be withheld for more than 3 weeks, after a 
scheduled treatment visit, for resolution of toxicity, the subject will not restart docetaxel 
treatment.  In the case of subjects who discontinue docetaxel because of toxicity attributable to 
docetaxel (Section 3.2.2.1), subjects may continue on ZACTIMA/placebo and will be 
followed for progression and survival.

Radiologic evaluation using RECIST will be performed at screening and then every 6 weeks 
after randomization.  It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible.  
Subjects will be evaluated until objective disease progression, and will then be followed for 
survival, unless they withdraw consent.  If a subject discontinues study medication prior to 
objective disease progression they should continue to be assessed by RECIST, as per the 
protocol schedule, until disease progression and then followed up for survival, unless they 
withdraw consent. 

PK samples will be obtained from 440 subjects, and all Japanese subjects, for a total of 580 
subjects randomized in the study. 

Every attempt will be made to obtain archived tumor samples from all consenting subjects 
randomized on the study, although tissue collection will not be mandatory.

All assessments are to be performed before administration of docetaxel unless otherwise indicated. At the 
Baseline Visit (Visit 2, day 1), vital signs, ECGs, hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis should be 
performed prior to administration of ZACTIMA/placebo and docetaxel. Assessments and treatment 
should be carried out as specified in the study plan.  If the scheduled study day falls on a weekend or 
holiday, every attempt should be made to have the treatment or assessment carried out within 3 calendar 
days of the scheduled day.

(a) 
(b) 

Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, temperature and weight (and height at screening). 

A single 12-lead ECG must be performed at screening (within 21 days before the first dose).  The 

screening QTc must be <480 msec.  If the single screening QTc is ≥480 msec (>460 msec for 

subjects who are receiving one of the drugs listed in Appendix D, Table 2 – see Exclusion Criteria 

#18), then the Investigator has the option to perform up to an additional 2 ECGs so that a maximum 

of 3 ECGs (each at least 24 hours apart) may be obtained at screening.  The QTc value used to 

determine eligibility would be the average of the QTc values obtained at screening.  

(c) 

On day 1, cycle one, 12-lead ECGs are to be performed pre-infusion.  Baseline QTc will be 

determined by the average of no less than 3 consecutive ECGs (within 5-10 minutes of one another) 

on day 1.  When possible, ECGs should be performed at the same time throughout the study 

(performed 4-8 hours after the subject takes their oral medication) at Visits 3, 5, 8, 10 (weeks 2, 4, 7, 

13), and then every 3 months up to and including discontinuation of ZACTIMA/placebo.  If QTc 

prolongation occurs at one of the usual assessment times, or at any other time, please refer to Section 

3.2.2.2 for further details. Subjects who are receiving one of the drugs listed in Appendix D, Table 2, 

at the time of study treatment must have an additional ECG obtained 4-8 hours after the first dose of 

ZD6474. 

(d) 

PK sampling will be taken close to or at the same time as the ECGs performed in Visits 3, 5, 8, 10 

(weeks 2, 4, 7, 13), and then every 3 months up to and including discontinuation of 

ZACTIMA/placebo.  No PK sample is required with the baseline ECG.  PK samples will be obtained 

from 440 subjects, and all Japanese subjects, for a total of 580 subjects.  ZACTIMA concentrations 

will be determined in all samples, and metabolite determination will be done in weeks 2 & 13 and 6-

month samples, from a minimum of 60 subjects identified as being on ZACTIMA. 

(e) 

Hematology and clinical chemistry should be performed at each visit until the end of docetaxel 

treatment.  After discontinuation of docetaxel, hematology and clinical chemistry should be 

performed at least every 3 weeks.  During the period of study treatment, more frequent assessment of 

hematology and clinical chemistry should be performed if clinically indicated, based on the 

Investigator's judgment. [For example, it is important to maintain patient's electrolytes within normal 

limits (see section 3.2.2.3) and some patients with diarrhea may require more frequent assessment of 

clinical chemistry to monitor for electrolyte abnormalities].  Hematology and clinical chemistry need 

only be assessed at Day 1 if the screening assessments were taken more than 7 days before. 

Premenopausal women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days 

before first dose of study medication. 

FACT-L & EQ5D questionnaires are to be administered at screening (within 7 days before the 1st 

dose) and every 3 weeks until discontinuation.  The FACT-L & EQ5D questionnaires should be 

completed before the subject receives docetaxel (even when delayed) and before the subject is given 

the results of their tumor assessments. 

(f) 

(g) 

(h) 

RECIST is carried out at screening (within 3 weeks before the 1st dose) and every 6 weeks following 

randomization until objective disease progression per RECIST.  If a subject discontinues study 

treatment prior to objective disease progression they should continue to be assessed for progression 

per RECIST every 6 weeks according to the protocol schedule, until disease progression and then 

followed up for survival, unless they withdraw consent.  Scans performed for RECIST will be 

expected to cover abdomen and chest (pelvic imaging is only required if clinically indicated).  Bone

lesions identified by CT, MRI or X-ray at baseline, covering abdomen, chest (and pelvis if clinically 

indicated), should be recorded as non-target lesions and followed as per study schedule.  Any 

additional bone lesions not covered by the protocol scans do not require regular isotopic bone scans.  

If new or worsening bone symptoms occur and a bone scan is performed then worsening of disease 

needs to be confirmed by X-ray, CT or MRI and recorded as a new lesion.  For subjects with 

cerebral metastases, regular cranial CT/MRI scans are not required.  If new or worsening symptoms 

occur and a CT/MRI scan is performed, then worsening of disease needs to be recorded as a new 

lesion.  If docetaxel is delayed, the RECIST assessment should be delayed in-line with docetaxel. 

RECIST assessments should be performed preceding administration of docetaxel, at the cycles 

indicated in the study plan (i.e. preceding cycles 3 and 5).  

(i) 

(j) 

Docetaxel and ZACTIMA/placebo are both started on Day 1. If docetaxel is delayed, all subsequent 

visit assessments, including RECIST and ECGs, should be delayed in-line with docetaxel. 

Plasma biomarker blood samples should be taken prior to administration of docetaxel either before 

or after administration of ZACTIMA/placebo.  Plasma samples should only be taken on subjects 

who qualify at screening for entry into the study. 

(k) 

Archival paraffin-embedded tumor sections and blood samples for genetic analysis should be 

collected from all consenting randomized subjects if available.  The archival paraffin-embedded 

tumor sections and blood samples can be obtained at any time during the study.

A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase III study will be appropriate to assess 
whether ZACTIMA plus docetaxel confers a longer PFS benefit when compared with placebo 
plus docetaxel in subjects with refractory, advanced NSCLC.  The population for this study 
will consist of subjects who failed 1st-line anti-cancer therapy and for whom docetaxel is 
therefore an appropriate therapeutic option (2nd-line subjects).  The study is based on the 
results of a randomized, double-blind, phase II study in 2nd-line NSCLC (study 6474IL/0006), 
which compared ZACTIMA 100 mg or 300 mg in combination with docetaxel to docetaxel 
plus placebo.  In this study, both doses of ZACTIMA provide superior efficacy in 
combination with docetaxel when compared to docetaxel plus placebo, but the 100 mg dose of 
ZACTIMA was superior to the 300 mg dose.  The median PFS for subjects who received 
ZACTIMA 100 mg plus docetaxel was 18.7 weeks, compared to 12.0 weeks for docetaxel 
plus placebo, with 2–sided p=0.07.  While this advantage in PFS did not meet statistical 
significance, the study was powered so that p<0.2 was considered evidence of activity worthy 
of further study.  In addition to the advantage of PFS, subjects who received ZACTIMA 100 
mg in combination with docetaxel had a higher response rate (26% vs 12%) and DCR at 6 
weeks (83% vs 56%) compared to subjects who received docetaxel plus placebo.  The survival 
data were immature at the time of the data cutoff, and the results were likely confounded by 
differences in subsequent therapy.  Common AEs experienced by subjects who received 
ZACTIMA included rash, diarrhea, and asymptomatic QTc prolongation, though the toxicity 
profile for ZACTIMA 100 mg in combination with docetaxel was not markedly different from 
that for docetaxel alone.  Therefore, the dose of ZACTIMA that will be studied in 
combination with docetaxel in the current study is 100 mg. 

The primary endpoint of PFS in this study, rather than overall survival, is justified by the 
increasing prevalence of 3rd-line therapies that are available for subjects who have disease 
progression after 2nd-line treatment.  These subsequent therapies are likely to impact the 
overall survival outcome, independent of the effects of ZACTIMA in the 2nd-line setting.  
Furthermore, regional and other variations in the standard of care may result in imbalances in 
the subsequent therapy received by subjects in the 2 treatment arms of the study.  The survival 
outcomes for subjects in the Phase II study 6474IL/0006 demonstrate the potential 
confounding nature of these subsequent therapies.  This study will include overall survival as 
a secondary endpoint, and all subjects will be followed for survival.  In addition, the study will 
include other measures of clinical benefit, including response rate, DCR, and measures of 
quality of life, to provide supportive data of the benefit of ZACTIMA. 

The use of placebo control in this study will provide for a robust assessment of the benefit of 
ZACTIMA in combination with docetaxel, and is considered appropriate in this subject

population because docetaxel is approved for use as a single-agent in the 2nd-line treatment of 
subjects with NSCLC.  By blinding subjects and Investigators, using a placebo control, and 
assessing tumor measurements on a fixed and frequent schedule, the risk of bias that could 
affect the interpretation of the PFS endpoint should be reduced. 

3.2.2 

Risk/benefit and ethical assessment 

All toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE, 
Version 3.  Management of toxicities including dose modifications are detailed below and 
summarized in Table 4. 

3.2.2.1  Docetaxel toxicity 

In the event of the following toxicities, docetaxel should be withheld and when the toxicity 
has resolved (to CTCAE grade 1 or baseline), docetaxel may be administered at 75% of the 
original dose (i.e. 55mg/m2) [In Japan only, docetaxel may be administered at a reduced dose 
of 50 mg/m2], unless the subject withdraws consent: 

-  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 x 109/L for more than 7 days 

- 

Febrile neutropenia or CTCAE grade 4 infection 

-  CTCAE grade 3 or 4 cutanous reactions 

-  CTCAE grade 3 or 4 edema 

-  Other CTCAE grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity 

For CTCAE grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy, docetaxel should be stopped and not 
restarted.  Docetaxel should be stopped for a grade 3 or 4 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity 
that is clearly related to docetaxel.  A re-challenge is permitted at the Investigator’s discretion. 

For other toxicity, if docetaxel must be withheld for more than 3 weeks for resolution of 
toxicity, or if CTCAE grade 3 or 4 toxicity recurs following the dose reduction, the subject 
will not restart docetaxel treatment. 

Subjects should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until platelets recover to 
a level ≥100 x 109/L. 

3.2.2.2  QTc prolongation 

Subjects will have ECGs performed to monitor the QTc interval (using Bazett’s correction).  
The screening QTc must be <480 msec (<460 msec for subjects who are receiving one of the 
drugs listed in Appendix D, Table 2 –see Exclusion Criteria #18). Up to 3 ECGs may be 
obtained at screening, and the mean QTc value used to determine eligibility. If a subject is 
receiving one of the medications in Appendix D, Group 2 prior to study entry, and it cannot be 
discontinued before study treatment, then the screening QTc must be <460msec, and an 
additional ECG must be obtained 4-8 hours after the first dose of ZD6474.   Baseline QTc will

be determined by the average of no less than 3 consecutive ECGs (within 5-10 minutes of one 
another) on Day 1.

Management of subjects with QTc prolongation 

For a single QTc value of ≥550 msec or an increase of ≥100 msec from baseline, 
ZACTIMA/placebo must be withheld.  ECGs and electrolytes (including potassium and 
magnesium) should be followed 3 times a week until QTc falls below 480 msec or baseline, 
whichever is higher.  ZACTIMA/placebo treatment may be resumed at a lower dose after the 
QTc recovers to <480 msec or baseline. 

For a QTc interval ≥500 msec, but <550 msec, or an increase of ≥60 msec but <100 msec 
from baseline QTc to a QTc value ≥480 msec, ZACTIMA/placebo may be continued but a 
repeat ECG (in triplicate, within 5-10 minutes of one another) must be obtained within 48 
hours.  If QTc prolongation is confirmed, ZACTIMA/placebo should be withheld.  ECGs and 
electrolytes (including potassium and magnesium) should be checked 3 times a week until 
QTc falls below 480 msec or baseline, whichever is higher.  ZACTIMA/placebo treatment 
may be resumed at a lower dose after the QTc recovers to <480 msec or baseline.  If the 
subject does not meet the criteria for QTc prolongation at the repeat ECG then the subject 
should continue treatment with double blind study medication and resume the ECG schedule 
as outlined in the Study Plan. 

Subjects who experience QTc prolongation may be given ZACTIMA 100 mg/placebo every 
other day, after the QTc recovers to <480 msec or baseline.  If ZACTIMA/placebo is restarted 
after the QTc prolongation has resolved, ECGs should be performed 1, 2, 4, 7, 13 weeks and 
then every 3 months after treatment is restarted.  After week 2, the timing of these ECGs can 
be adjusted to correspond with the docetaxel schedule, where relevant.  If ZACTIMA/placebo 
must be withheld for >3 weeks to allow for QTc prolongation to recover <480 msec or 
baseline, the subject will not be restarted on study medication.  If QTc prolongation recurs 
after the dose reduction as detailed, the subject must permanently discontinue treatment with 
ZACTIMA/placebo. 

3.2.2.3  Gastrointestinal toxicity 

Nausea, vomiting, or both may be controlled with antiemetic therapy.  In subjects who have 
emesis and are unable to retain the ZACTIMA/placebo, every attempt should be made to 
obtain control of nausea and vomiting.  The dose of ZACTIMA/placebo may be repeated if 
emesis occurs within 30 minutes of taking the tablet. 

Diarrhea should be treated with standard medications to avoid dose modification or 
interruption, if possible.  Electrolyte supplementation and regular laboratory monitoring 
should be used, when appropriate, to maintain electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium) 
within normal limits and prevent an increased risk of QTc prolongation.  No dose 
modifications will be made because of grade 1 or 2 diarrhea.  If grade 3 diarrhea develops, 
ZACTIMA/placebo and docetaxel should be withheld until diarrhea resolves to grade 1 or 
baseline. Subjects who are clinically unstable because of diarrhea or other intercurrent medical 
illness must be admitted and evaluated using telemetry, until clinically stable.  Upon recovery, 
treatment may resume at a permanently reduced dose (of ZACTIMA/placebo 
100 mg given every other day.  Docetaxel should be reduced to 50 mg/m2 
Japan only; 75% of the original dose [55 mg/m2] all other countries, at the

discretion of the Investigator.  If ZACTIMA/placebo must be withheld for more than 3 weeks 
for resolution of diarrhea, the subject will not restart ZACTIMA/placebo.  If grade 3 or 4 
diarrhea recurs after this dose reduction, the subject must permanently discontinue 
ZACTIMA/placebo. 

3.2.2.4  Cutaneous toxicity 

It is strongly recommended that all subjects follow a program of sun protective measures 
while receiving study therapy and for 3-4 weeks after discontinuing study therapy.  The aim is 
to reduce the risk of development of skin rash, or minimize the severity of skin rash, and to 
minimize the requirement for dose reduction of study therapy. 

If a subject develops a skin rash, the following actions are recommended to the Investigator 
for the management of this reaction: 

-  A variety of agents can be used to manage skin rashes.  These include mild to 
moderate strength steroid creams, either topical or systemic antibiotics, topical 
or systemic antihistamines, and occasionally retinoid creams. 

- 

- 

- 

The rash should be graded as soon as possible according to the CTCAE 
cutaneous toxicity criteria (NCI CTCAE, Version 3). 

If a rash of CTCAE grade 2 or higher is detected, immediate symptomatic 
treatment should be provided. 

If a rash of CTCAE grade 3 or higher is detected, ZACTIMA/placebo and 
docetaxel should be withheld until recovery to grade 1 or baseline. The 
following actions should be instituted: 

  Docetaxel should be reduced to 50 mg/m2 in Japan, 55 mg/m2 in all 

other countries (at the discretion of the Investigator) 

  ZACTIMA/placebo should be reduced to 100 mg/placebo every other 

day 

If severe cutaneous toxicity (CTCAE grade 3 or higher) recurs at reduced dose of 
ZACTIMA/placebo, the subject will permanently discontinue study treatment of 
ZACTIMA/placebo.  The subject may remain on 50 mg/m2 of docetaxel, Japan only, and 
55 mg/m2 of docetaxel, all other countries, at the discretion of the study Investigator, once the 
rash has recovered to grade 1 or baseline. 

If ZACTIMA/placebo or docetaxel must be withheld for >3 weeks due to cutaneous toxicity, 
the subject will be discontinued. 

3.2.2.5  Other toxicity 

If any other grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is not outlined in Sections 3.2.2.1 to 3.2.2.4 develops 
and is attributable to either ZACTIMA/placebo or docetaxel, ZACTIMA/placebo and 

38(87)

Drug Substance ZACTIMA™ (ZD6474)   
Study Code D4200C00032  
Edition Number 7.0 
Date 07MAY2007 
docetaxel should be withheld until the toxicity resolves to grade 1 or baseline.  Upon recovery, 
treatment may resume at a permanent reduced dose (ZACTIMA should be reduced to 100 
mg/placebo every other day; docetaxel should be reduced to 50/55 mg/m2 at the discretion of 
the Investigator).  If ZACTIMA/placebo must be withheld for more than 3 weeks for 
resolution of toxicity attributable to ZACTIMA/placebo, the subject will not restart 
ZACTIMA/placebo.  If grade 3 or 4 toxicity recurs after dose reduction, the subject must 
permanently discontinue ZACTIMA/placebo.  Docetaxel may be discontinued at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  Subjects who develop CTCAE grade 3 hypertension may 
continue on therapy if blood pressure is controlled on antihypertensive medication.  If blood 
pressure cannot be stabilized with increased antihypertensive medication, ZACTIMA/placebo 
must be discontinued and cannot be resumed until blood pressure is controlled to baseline 
level.  Subjects with CTCAE grade 4 hypertension should discontinue ZACTIMA/placebo 
and cannot resume therapy until blood pressure is controlled to baseline level.  If study 
treatment must be interrupted for more than 3 weeks to allow for toxicity to resolve, the 
subject’s participation in the part of the study will be discontinued.

3.3.5  Withdrawal from study and discontinuation of treatment 

3.3.5.1  Withdrawal from study 

Subjects will be considered to have withdrawn from the study only in the event of death, loss 
to follow-up, or informed consent is withdrawn.  In this case, no data will be collected after 
the date of withdrawal of informed consent. 

Subjects may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to further treatment. 

3.3.5.2  Procedures for withdrawal from participation in the study 

The reason for withdrawal from participation in the study should be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF(s).  This is also applicable to screening failures (subjects who were enrolled 
but were never randomized into the study due to failure of inclusion/exclusion criteria) and 
their reason for withdrawal should be recorded as incorrect enrollment (ie, subject does not 
meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria).  The Investigator should immediately notify 
AstraZeneca of a subject’s withdrawal from the study. 

3.3.5.3  Discontinuation of treatment 

Discontinuation from study treatment is when a subject no longer receives study medication 
but continues to be followed up for objective disease progression and/or survival. 

Specific reasons for discontinuing study treatment are: 

-  Voluntary discontinuation by the subject who is at any time free stop study 

medication, without prejudice to further treatment 

- 

- 

- 

Safety reasons as judged by the Investigator and/or AstraZeneca 

Severe non-compliance to protocol as judged by the Investigator and/or 
AstraZeneca 

Subject lost to follow-up 

-  Disease progression 

3.3.5.4  Procedures for discontinuation from study treatment 

Subjects who discontinue from the study treatment should always be asked about the reason(s) 
for their discontinuation and the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they should be seen and 
assessed by an investigator(s).  AEs are to be followed for 60 days; diary cards (if applicable), 
questionnaires (eg, for subject reported outcomes) and investigational products should be 
returned by the subject.  The discontinuation visit should take place after the last dose of 
ZACTIMA/placebo or chemotherapy, whichever comes last.  Following the discontinuation 
visit, there is a 30-day and 60-day follow-up visit that should also take place.  Subjects should 
be contacted for survival status every 6 weeks following the discontinuation visit. 

Subjects who discontinue the study treatment prior to disease progression must be assessed for 
progression by RECIST once every 6 weeks until objective disease progression, and should

then be contacted for survival status every 6 weeks.  These subjects must also have both 
weight and WHO PS assessments every 6 weeks until objective disease progression.  Subjects 
who discontinue due to disease progression should be contacted for survival status every 6 
weeks following the discontinuation visit. 

Survival status should be collected by telephone contact with the subject, subject’s family, or 
by contact with the subject’s current physician.  The details of first and subsequent therapies 
for cancer, after discontinuation of treatment, will be collected. 

All ongoing AEs and SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless in the Investigator’s 
opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the subject’s underlying disease.  All new 
AEs and all SAEs occurring up to 60 days after the last dose of ZACTIMA/placebo or 
chemotherapy, whichever was dosed last, must be reported to AstraZeneca and must be 
followed until resolution where possible. 

All subjects who have any CTCAE grade 3 or 4 laboratory values at the time of 
discontinuation must have further tests performed and the results recorded on the appropriate 
electronic case report form (eCRF) until the lab values have returned to CTCAE grade 1, 
unless these values are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.

reach of children.  Subjects will be supplied with sufficient medication to continue treatment 
between each visit. 

3.4.2 

Doses and treatment regimens 

3.4.2.1  ZACTIMA or placebo regimen 

Subjects will be given single oral doses of 100 mg ZACTIMA or placebo daily.  ZACTIMA 
or placebo tablets must be taken whole and they must not be broken or crushed and dissolved.  
There are no food restrictions for the administration of ZACTIMA or matching placebo.  
Subjects can continue to receive treatment as long as they are benefiting from treatment in the 
opinion of the Investigator, and they do not meet the criteria of discontinuation.  There is no 
maximum duration of treatment for ZACTIMA/placebo.  After 6 cycles of docetaxel, subjects 
will continue on blinded ZACTIMA/placebo monotherapy until progression.  

Blinded ZACTIMA/placebo should not be combined with any other anti-cancer therapies, and 
should be discontinued following objective disease progression. See Table 1 and 2 for 
schedule of assessments. 

Subjects enrolled in the trial will be dispensed bottles of blinded ZACTIMA tablets; each 
bottle will contain ZACTIMA 100 mg, or placebo tablets as determined by the randomization 
scheme.  Subjects will take 1 tablet per day at the same time of day each morning.  
ZACTIMA/placebo should be taken prior to the administration of docetaxel due to the timings 
of the required ECGs and PK samples.  As stated in Table 1, footnote j, these samples can be 
taken before or after ZACTIMA/placebo. 

If the subject inadvertently does not take the dose in the morning, he or she may take that 
day’s dose any time up to 10 p.m. that same day.  However, if a subject misses taking their 
scheduled dose and is unable to take the missed dose on the same day, he or she must take the 
next scheduled dose and the missed dose will not be made up.  The missed dose must be 
documented on the appropriate eCRF.  The dose of study treatment may be repeated if 
vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of taking the study treatment. 

3.4.2.2  ZACTIMA dose reduction 

There will be no intrasubject dose escalation in this study.  Subjects who have toxicity related 
to ZACTIMA/placebo may have their dose reduced (see Section 3.2.2 for guidance on 
management of toxicity).  If the subject experiences toxicity, they can be given 100 mg 
ZACTIMA/placebo every other day.  If the subject experiences toxicity attributed to 
ZACTIMA/placebo on the reduced dose, the subject will discontinue ZACTIMA/placebo 
treatment.  Dose reduction will be managed in blinded manner.

3.4.2.3  Docetaxel 
The registered, approved dose of docetaxel (60 mg/m2 Japan only; 75 mg/m2 all other 
countries) will be administered intravenously over at least a 1-hour period every 21 days, up 
to a maximum of 6 cycles.  If toxicity is seen, docetaxel will be reduced (to 50 mg/m2 Japan 
only; 75% of the original dose [55 mg/m2] all other countries [as outlined in Section 3.2.2.1]). 

Subjects should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids such as dexamethasone 8 mg twice 
daily for 3 days starting one day before each dose of docetaxel.  Investigators may choose an 
alternative corticosteroid premedication in accordance with approved local practice.  In the 
event that the subject forgets to take the oral corticosteroid prior to Day 1 of each cycle, an IV 
dose can be given at the discretion of the Investigator.  Additional doses of IV dexamethasone, 
or alternative corticosteroid, may be given at the Investigators discretion.  Antiemetics may be 
used for the prevention or management of nausea and vomiting.  Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) or 
filgrastim (Neupogen®) may also be administered, and as with all concomitant medications 
given during the course of the study, must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 

Standard cytotoxic handling procedures must be used when preparing docetaxel for 
administration.  Skin reactions associated with the accidental exposure to docetaxel may 
occur; the use of gloves is recommended. 

Any unused diluted infusion solutions of docetaxel must be discarded. 

The dose will be calculated on the basis of the height and weight of the subject, recorded at 
baseline.  Body surface area (BSA) should be calculated using the Mosteller method {BSA 
(m²) = ([Ht (cm) x Wt (kg)]/ 3600)½} or the DuBois and DuBois formula [BSA (m²) = 
0.20247 x Ht (m)0.725 x Wt (kg)0.425].  If the subject’s weight changes by more than 10% from 
that used in the previous calculation of BSA during the study, the Investigator should 
recalculate the BSA and amend the dose accordingly. 

3.4.3 

Labeling 

One bottle of ZACTIMA/placebo should be dispensed to subjects every 3 weeks. 

Information on the bottle labels will indicate the trial number, unique material code, blinded 
contents, caution, and storage conditions and will have blank spaces for the E-code and 
dispensing date (to be written in by the site personnel at the center at the time of dispensing).  
Dosing instructions will be included on the label.

3.4.4 

Storage 

All investigational products must be kept in a secure place under appropriate storage 
conditions.  A description of the appropriate storage and shipment conditions are specified on 
the investigational product bottle label. 

3.4.5 

Accountability 

The trial treatment(s) must be used only as directed in the protocol.  Records of overall 
dispensing and returns will be maintained by each center, separately from the eCRFs 
recording the treatment dispensed to individual subjects. 

Subjects must return all unused medication and empty containers to the Investigator, who will 
retain these until they are collected by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals authorized personnel, 
along with any trial treatments not dispensed. 

The Investigator must maintain accurate records accounting for the receipt of the 
investigational products and for the disposition of the material.  This record keeping consists 
of a dispensing record including the identification of the person to whom the drug was 
dispensed, the quantity and date of dispensing, and any unused drug returned to the 
Investigator.  This record is in addition to any drug accountability information recorded on the 
eCRFs.  At the termination of the trial or at the request of the sponsor, the Investigator must 
send any unused supplies for destruction in liaison with their AstraZeneca Study Delivery 
Operations Specialist (SDOS). 

3.5 

Method of assigning subjects to treatment groups 

As subjects are screened for the study, they must be allocated an E-code.  The E-code is a 7-
digit number made up of the center number and the subject number within that particular 
center (eg, the first subject screened at center number 0001 would be assigned the E-code 
E0001001, the second subject screened would be E0001002 and so on).  This number is the 
subject’s unique identifier and is used to identify the subject on the eCRFs.  For this study, an 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) system will be used.  When a subject is entered 
into screening, the Investigator should contact the Centralized Registration/Randomization 
Center by telephone to register the subject.  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.  All 
screened subjects are assigned an E-code irrespective of whether or not they are subsequently 
randomized to receive study treatment. 

The actual treatment given to individual subjects will be determined by a randomization 
scheme.  The randomization scheme will be produced by a computer software program that 
incorporates a standard procedure for generating random numbers.  Randomization numbers 
will be allocated to centers in balanced blocks. The block size will be such that the 
randomization scheme will effectively be stratified by center. 

If a subject discontinues from the study, the subject E-code number will not be reused, and the 
subject will not be allowed to re-enter the study.

Amended Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZACTIMA™ (ZD6474)   
Study Code D4200C00032  
Edition Number 7.0 
Date 07MAY2007 
Subject eligibility will be established before treatment randomization.  Subjects will be 
randomized strictly sequentially, as subjects are eligible for randomization.  Once the 
eligibility of a subject has been confirmed, the Investigator (or nominated assistant) should 
contact the Centralized Registration/Randomization Center by telephone for the issue of a 
subject randomization code and allocation of randomized therapy.  Subjects will be identified 
to the Centralized Registration/Randomization Center using subject initials, E-code, and date 
of birth.  The Centralized Registration/Randomization Center will inform the Investigator of 
the subject randomization number and treatment to be allocated.  The subject randomization 
number will correspond to either docetaxel plus ZACTIMA or docetaxel plus placebo. 

3.6 

Blinding and procedures for unblinding the study 

3.6.1  Methods for ensuring blinding 

Medication will be labeled using a unique material pack code which is linked to the 
randomization scheme.  The Centralized Registration/ Randomization Center will assign the 
bottle of study material to be dispensed to each subject at each visit.  The active and placebo 
tablets will be identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the 
medication. 

3.6.2  Methods for unblinding the study 

The subject's randomization code break will be available to the Investigator at the study center 
through IVRS. 

The treatment code must not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject necessitates knowledge of the treatment randomization.  The 
Investigator(s) must document and report to AstraZeneca any breaking of the treatment code.  
AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. 

Subjects should be counseled by their Investigator on the relevant contacts if they experience 
AEs or toxicity and are being evaluated outside of the Investigative site. 

Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the 
evaluability of the data from each individual subject have been made and documented.  
Unblinded PK data will not be accessed by AstraZeneca staff affiliated with the conduct of the 
study prior to study completion. 

3.6.3  Methods for breaking the blind for monitoring of the safety 

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be in place before the start of the 
study to monitor emerging toxicity. 

The blind should be maintained for personnel at AstraZeneca, such as biometrics personnel, 
who are responsible for analysis and interpretation of the results at the study’s conclusion.

3.7 

Pre-study, concomitant and post-study treatment(s) 

3.7.1 

Treatment for cancer 

At entry to the study and while the subject remains on study medication (ZACTIMA or 
placebo), subjects must not be given any concurrent cancer therapy, including cytotoxic 
agents, radiotherapy (except for palliative radiotherapy), biological response modifiers, 
hormonal therapy, or any other investigational agents.  Cytokines are permitted for the 
prophylaxis and management of neutropenia.  Systemic anticancer therapy or other 
investigational agents must have been stopped at least 4 weeks before study treatment; 
nitrosoureas, mitomycin C and suramin must have been stopped at least 6 weeks before study 
treatment.  Previous treatment with bevacizumab for NSCLC is permitted. 

After the subject withdraws from study medication, the details of the first and subsequent 
therapies for cancer, after study medication withdrawal, will be collected. 

3.7.1.1  Palliative Radiotherapy 

A subject may receive local/regional radiotherapy to a symptomatic target and/or non-target 
lesion(s) in the absence of disease progression, which must be confirmed by objective 
evaluation.  This information must be recorded on the RECIST eCRFs.  This treatment will 
affect the analysis of these lesions, as described in Section 4.6.3.1. 

Currently, limited information is available regarding the safety and therapeutic benefit of the 
combination of ZACTIMA and radiotherapy.  Thus the investigator may use his/her own 
discretion of whether to stop or continue ZACTIMA during the radiation therapy ensuring 
careful safety monitoring. 

3.7.2 

Other concomitant treatment 

Subjects should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids such as dexamethasone 8 mg twice 
daily for 3 days starting one day before each dose of docetaxel or according to local practices.  
Investigators may choose an alternative corticosteroid premedication in accordance with 
approved local practice.  In the event that the subject forgets to take the dexamethasone, or 
alternative corticosteroid, prior to Day 1 of each cycle, an IV dose can be given at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  Additional doses of IV dexamethasone, or alternative 
corticosteroid, can be given at the Investigator’s discretion. 

Supportive care measures and symptomatic treatment for any treatment-associated toxicity 
may be instituted once the first signs of toxicity occur. 

Concomitant use of the known potent inducers of CYP3A4:  rifampicin, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, barbiturates and St John's Wort are not allowed within 2 weeks of start of 
study treatment or during the study. 

Concomitant use of medications generally accepted as having a risk of causing Torsades de 
Pointes (see Appendix D Table 1) are not allowed within 2 weeks of start of study treatment

or during study.  These drugs should also be avoided for up to 4 weeks following 
discontinuation of ZACTIMA/placebo. 

The following medications can be taken by subjects, but require additional monitoring: 

-  Co-administration of drugs that in some reports might be associated with 

Torsades de Pointes but at this time lack substantial evidence of Torsades de 
Pointes (see Appendix D, Table 2) should be avoided if possible.  However, 
these drugs will be allowed, at the discretion of the Investigator, if considered 
absolutely necessary.  In such cases, the subject must be closely monitored 
including regular checks of QTc and electrolytes (including potassium, 
magnesium). If a subject is receiving one of the medications in this group 
prior to study entry, and it cannot be discontinued before study treatment, then 
the screening QTc must be <460msec, and an additional ECG must be 
obtained 4-8 hours after the first dose of ZD6474. For subjects who start on 
one of the drugs in this group while on the study, the ECG must be checked 
within 24 hours of commencing the concomitant medication and then at least 
once per week while the subject remains on the medication.  The frequency of 
ECG monitoring could revert to the standard schedule if no ECG prolongation 
has been noted during 4 weeks of co-administration of a drug from Appendix 
D, Table 2.  The electrolytes should be maintained within the normal range 
using supplements if necessary. 

-  Warfarin is allowed in therapeutic and low-doses and these subjects should be 

monitored regularly for changes in their International Normalized Ratio 
(INR), at the discretion of the Investigator. 

Other medication, which is considered necessary for the subject’s safety and well-being, may 
be given at the discretion of the Investigator(s).  The administration of all medication 
(including investigational products) must be recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF). 

3.8 

Treatment compliance 

It is the Investigator or institution’s responsibility to establish a system for handling study 
treatments, including investigational medicinal products, to ensure the following: 

-  Deliveries of such products from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals are correctly 

received by a responsible person (eg, a pharmacist) 

- 

- 

- 

Such deliveries are recorded 

Study treatments are handled and stored safely and properly 

Study treatments are only dispensed to study subjects in accordance with the 
protocol

-  Any unused products are returned for destruction in liaison with the 

AstraZeneca project team 

At the end of the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage 
and returned stocks.  Any discrepancies must be accounted for.  Certificates of delivery and 
return must be signed, preferably by the Investigator or a pharmacist. 

Subjects should be given clear instructions on how and when to take their study treatment.  
Their tablet returns should be counted to check for compliance.  Discrepancies between the 
number of tablets returned and the expected number of tablets returned should be discussed 
with the subject and the reasons for non-compliance documented. 

If the subject is not compliant after counseling on the importance of taking study medication 
as instructed, the Investigator may withdraw the subject from study treatment.

Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) 

The methods for collecting Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) data are presented below. 

4.3.1 

FACT-L questionnaire incorporating the LCS subscale 

4.3.1.1  Methods of assessment 

QoL data will be assessed by use of the FACT-L questionnaire (see Appendix F).  FACT-L 
will be assessed as outlined in the study plan.  Symptoms will be assessed using the LCS, a 
section of the FACT-L focusing on symptoms of lung cancer (see Appendix F).  FACT-L has 
been validated with respect to its psychometric properties and sensitivity to clinical changes 
(Cella et al 1993, 1995, 2002). 

4.3.1.2  Derivation or calculation of variable 

The following scores will be derived from the FACT-L questionnaire: 

- 

- 

The 7-item LCS total score 

The 4-item Pulmonary Symptom Index (PSI) score

- 

The total FACT-G score, made up of the sum of the 4 individual subscale 
scores from the core FACT-L questionnaire:  physical well-being (PWB), 
social well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and functional well-
being (FWB)

- 

The TOI, made up of the sum of PWB, FWB, and LCS scores 

The overall score for the FACT-L questionnaire 

Individual subscale scores from the core questionnaire:  PWB, SWB, EWB 
and FWB 

For each subscale, if less than 50% of the subscale items are missing, the subscale score will 
be divided by the number of non-missing items and multiplied by the total number of items on 
the subscale.  If at least 50% of the items are missing, that subscale also will be treated as 
missing.  The reason for any missing data will be identified.  If data is missing at random, the 
above techniques will be used.  If there is evidence that the missing data is systematic, missing 
values will be handled to ensure that any possible bias is minimized. 

4.3.2 

Time to deterioration of disease related symptoms (TDS) 

4.3.2.1  Methods of assessment 

Symptoms will be assessed using the LCS, a section of the FACT-L focusing on symptoms of 
lung cancer (see Appendix F). 

4.3.2.2  Derivation or calculation of variable 

Baseline LCS is defined as the FACT-L questionnaire closest to, but not subsequent to, the 
first dose of ZACTIMA/placebo or docetaxel with a non-missing LCS score.  At a given time 
point, deterioration in LCS is defined as ≤ -3 change from baseline score. 
TDS based on FACT-L LCS is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the 
first assessment of ‘deterioration’ without an improvement within the next 21 days. 

If a deterioration of disease-related symptoms has not been observed at the time of analysis, 
time to deterioration LCS will be censored as of the last non-missing LCS assessment date. 

4.3.3 

Administration of ePRO/pPRO questionnaires 

FACT-L should be given to subjects at baseline and as detailed in the study plan, before 
assessments, prior to administration of docetaxel, and before imparting any news about the 
status of their disease.  If docetaxel is delayed, the FACT-L questionnaire should be 
completed preceding the next administration of docetaxel.  Subjects should be allowed to 
complete the electronic or paper questionnaire in their own time, and without any help from 
relatives or clinic staff.  An electronic form will be completed by the clinic staff to detail if an 
ePRO/pPRO questionnaire has been completed at each QoL visit, and if not, the reason will be 
recorded.

Amended Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZACTIMA™ (ZD6474)   
Study Code D4200C00032  
Edition Number 7.0 
Date 07MAY2007 
Each center must allocate responsibility for the FACT-L questionnaire to a specific individual 
(ie, a Research Nurse).  The AstraZeneca Study Delivery Team will provide training for 
relevant personnel in the administration of the FACT-L questionnaire, which will be collected 
using either an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) or as paper questionnaires.  It is 
also important that the significance and relevance of the data are explained carefully to 
participating subjects so that they are motivated to comply with data collection (Fallowfield et 
al 1987). 

The instructions for completion of the FACT-L questionnaire are: 

- 

- 

The subject must complete it in private in his or her own time 

The subject must complete it before any investigations or discussions about 
their disease with the clinic staff (including administration of docetaxel 
treatment) 

Help should not be given from relatives or clinical staff unless the subject is blind or illiterate. 
In this case, the subject can receive help from a study nurse in reading the instructions and 
questions.  However, under no circumstances should help in interpreting the questions or in 
selecting responses be provided. 

4.4 

Health Economic measurements and variables 

The methods for collecting Health Economic data are presented below. 

4.4.1 

Resource data 

4.4.1.1  Methods of assessment 

Health care resource data will be collected at each cycle after baseline until progression and at 
the 30 day follow-up visit, including at each unscheduled visit, which requires the subject to 
see a clinician.  Resource data will include inpatient stays and outpatient visits. 

4.4.1.2  Derivation or calculation of variable 

Data will be presented as means and standard deviations for each treatment arm. 

4.4.2 

EQ5D 

4.4.2.1  Methods of assessment 

The EQ5D descriptive system is a standardized instrument for use in the measurement of 
health outcome, applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatment (EuroQoL 
1990). 

The EQ5D (EuroQoL group 1990) will be self-administered along with the FACT-L.  The 
EQ5D is a utility measure designed to provide an assessment of general health status of the 
individual.  This instrument is extensively validated and is available in several languages that 
facilitate its use in multinational studies.

4.4.2.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 

The EQ5D descriptive system comprises 5 questions (see Appendix I) which generate 
possible health states which can be converted into a weighted health status index by applying 
scores from the appropriate available ‘value sets’. 

The responses on EQ5D will be used to derive a unique EuroQoL health state.  For each 
EuroQoL health state there exists a corresponding valuation.  This valuation will be used for 
health economic issues.

4.5.1 

Collection of pharmacokinetic samples 

Venous blood will be taken at the sampling times shown in the study plan, into tubes 
containing lithium heparin anticoagulant and thoroughly mixed.  The blood samples will then 
be centrifuged within 15 minutes of collection by spinning at 1000 G for 10 minutes.  The 
plasma should be taken off immediately and stored in a plain tube at -20 ºC before 
transportation to the central holding laboratory.  The date and the time of collection will be 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  Further details on collection, labeling, and shipping are in 
the central laboratory manual.

4.5.2 

Drug concentration measurements, and derivation or calculation of 
pharmacokinetic parameters 

A validated high performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric 
detection will be used to measure the plasma concentration of ZACTIMA and the N-
desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites. 

4.5.2.1  ZACTIMA 

The PK data will be analyzed using non-linear mixed effects models (Beal and Sheiner, 1988-
1998).  The PK structural models will be developed in addition to inter- and intra-individual 
variance models.  Assumptions of the pharmacokinetics will be based on previous data and the 
exact nature of the structural, inter-individual variance and intra-individual variance models 
will be base on examination of the diagnostic scatter plots (predicted versus observed 
concentrations, weighted residual versus predicted concentrations, weighted residuals versus 
time, final parameter estimates, standard error of the parameter estimates, estimated objective 
function and structure of the variance/covariance matrix).  If data from the study proves 
limited and is identified as insufficient to define the pharmacokinetics (large standard errors, 
non-identifiable PK profile), additional data will be included from previous clinical trials.  
Depending on the definition of the PK model parameter, estimates for all subjects will be 
calculated using Bayesian based methodology.  Parameters will include plasma drug 
clearance, estimated maximum drug concentration, half-life, and volumes of distribution.  
Once the PK model is defined, covariates (including age, weight, race, gender, etc) will be 
added in a step-wise manner, and the statistical significance tested via a relevant change in the 
objective function, depending on the statistical significance level.  The clinical relevance of all 
covariates included in the model will be explored and discussed, through simulation. 

With the derivation of the parameters, estimates and accurate predictions of the plasma 
concentration, modeling of the pharmacodynamics, (QTc, AEs, and efficacy end points will 
then be undertaken.  In a similar manner to the pharmacokinetics model, accuracy will be 
undertaken through diagnostic plots. 

A PK analysis plan will be prepared prior to the commencement of this analysis. 

4.5.2.2  N-desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites 

For 60 subjects on ZACTIMA that attain 6 months on study, of the 580 PK subjects, the 
plasma levels of the N-desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites of ZACTIMA will be determined 
in the samples taken during weeks 2 and 13 and at 6 months.  Accumulation ratios will be 
determined at week 13 and at 6 months from the week 13 and 6 month concentrations divided 
by the week 2 concentration.  The ratio of each metabolite to ZACTIMA will be determined 
by dividing each metabolite by the ZACTIMA concentration for the weeks 2 and 13 and 6 
month samples. 

Individual plasma concentrations, accumulation ratios and ratios of ZACTIMA to metabolites 
will be listed and summarized by sample time.

4.6.1 

Progression-free survival (PFS) 

4.6.1.1  Methods of assessment 

PFS is determined using data from RECIST assessments performed at baseline, during 
treatment and during the follow-up period. 

4.6.1.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 

PFS will be defined from the date of randomization to the date of objective progression or 
death (by any cause in the absence of progression).  Subjects who have not progressed or died 
at the time of statistical analysis will be censored at the time of their latest objective tumor 
assessment.  This includes subjects who are lost to follow-up or have withdrawn consent.  For 
subjects lost to follow-up without having progressed, death within a further 3 months will be 
considered an event, otherwise the subject will be censored for PFS at the time of their last 
tumor assessment date. 

4.6.2 

Time to death 

4.6.2.1  Methods of assessment 

Subjects survival status throughout the course of the study will be used to determine overall 
survival (OS). 

4.6.2.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 

OS is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death.  Subjects who have not 
died at the time of the statistical analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to 
be alive. 

4.6.3 

Objective response, disease control and duration of response 

4.6.3.1  Methods of assessment 

The RECIST criteria will be used to perform the objective tumor assessments and determine a 
subject’s PFS and best overall objective tumor response; details are given in Appendix E. 

Baseline radiological tumor assessments should be performed within 21 days prior (but no 
more than 28 days prior) to the first dose of ZACTIMA/placebo, before study treatment, and 
at all time points defined in the study plan. 

Previously irradiated lesions will not be considered measurable. 

All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 10 lesions and representative of all involved 
organs (maximum of 5 lesions per organ), should be identified as target lesions and will be 
recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the LD) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by 
imaging techniques or clinically).  A sum of the LD for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to 
further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.

Amended Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZACTIMA™ (ZD6474)   
Study Code D4200C00032  
Edition Number 7.0 
Date 07MAY2007 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also 
be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed 
as “present”, “absent”, or “present with progression”. 

Lesions must be assessed using the same method and technique on each occasion.  Lesions 
will be recorded on the eCRF in the same order as they were recorded at screening.  Details of 
any new lesions will also be collected. 

For subjects who have target lesions that have been subjected to local/regional radiotherapy 
for symptom control (palliative radiotherapy) during the course of the study the following 
rules will be applied.  The subject will not be allowed a response of CR or PR following 
radiotherapy.  The subject will be assessed for evidence of disease progression.  If there is no 
evidence of disease progression, the subject can be assigned a response of stable disease. 

A subject is determined to have progressed if they have progression of target lesions, clear 
progression of existing non-target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions (see 
Appendix E).  Progression of target lesions is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of 
the LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum of LD recorded.  Death will be 
regarded as a progression event in those subjects who die before documented disease 
progression.  Unequivocal malignant disease identified on additional anatomical imaging e.g. 
CT or MRI or bone scan confirmed by x-ray, prompted by symptoms is considered disease 
progression and should be recorded as new lesions.  If the Investigator is in doubt as to 
whether progression has occurred, particularly with respect to non-target lesions and the 
appearance of a new lesion then it is advisable to pursue treatment until the next scheduled 
visit, or earlier if felt appropriate by the Investigator (and then repeat the RECIST assessment 
to confirm progression). 

Categorization of the objective tumor response assessments will be based on the RECIST 
criteria for target and non-target lesions.  Response will be assigned as CR, PR, SD or 
progressive disease (PD) at each scheduled visit by the Investigator.  For the purposes of 
analysis the sponsor will determine visit and overall response using the lesion assessments 
recorded on the eCRF. 

It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible as PFS is the primary 
endpoint and biases in analysis can occur if 1 treatment group is examined more often or 
sooner than the other.  If an unscheduled radiological and clinical tumor assessment is 
performed, and the subject has not progressed, the next scheduled tumor assessment should 
still be performed at the planned time (as detailed in the study plan).  This is in order to 
minimize any unintentional bias caused by some subjects being monitored at a different 
frequency than other subjects. 

Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to objective disease progression should 
continue to have RECIST assessments every 6 weeks as per protocol schedule until 
progression is documented, unless the subject withdraws consent.

Date 07MAY2007 
After discontinuation of the study treatment, and completion of the 30-day and 60-day follow-
up visits, subjects should be followed for survival every 6 weeks, as outlined in the study plan, 
unless the subject withdraws consent.  Adherence to the study plan should be observed 
whenever possible. 

For subjects with objective response of CR or PR, confirmation of response by repeat imaging 
should be performed at the next scheduled RECIST visit at 6 weeks and not earlier than 4 
weeks following date of response. 

4.6.3.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 

The overall best ORR will be calculated as the percentage of subjects with CR or PR.  The 
DCR will be calculated as the percentage of subjects with CR or PR or SD ≥ 6 weeks. 

DOR will be calculated for those subjects who have a best response of CR or PR only.  DOR 
will be defined in two ways: 

1. 

2. 

from date of randomization until the date of documented disease progression or 
death from any cause in the absence of documented progression, and 

from the date of first documentation of response until date of documented disease 
progression or death from any cause in the absence of documented progression. 

4.6.4 

Pharmacodynamic biomarker measurements and variables 

Blood plasma samples will be collected as outlined in the Study Plan and assessed for 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers.  Archival tumor tissue will be collected from consenting 
subjects and assessed for pharmacodynamic biomarkers.  Archival tumor tissue may be 
derived from tumor resections, tumor biopsies, pleural effusions, or other cytology samples, 
but should be presented as formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks or slides.  
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be investigated for possible correlation with clinical 
outcomes (survival, response, and PFS) and for the effects of the study medication. 

Since this is a rapidly evolving and complex area of investigation, and as yet not completely 
understood, pharmacodynamic biomarker data obtained in this study will not be definitive, but 
may generate hypotheses that are likely to require further testing in additional clinical studies. 

4.6.4.1  Methods of assessment 

Plasma samples 

Plasma will be prepared from venous blood (10 mL) collected at screening, at Day 1 of cycles 
1 through 6, and at withdrawal (see Table 9 for details).  Plasma protein levels of VEGF, 
bFGF and VEGFR2 will be determined.  If the current assays become more sensitive, we will 
investigate other potential protein biomarkers associated with tumor angiogenesis in these 
plasma samples (see central laboratory manual for further details regarding sample collection, 
preparation and shipment).

Archival tumor samples 

In subjects where samples are available, archival, paraffin-embedded tumor samples should be 
collected for consenting subjects for analysis of (i) EGFR expression, and related signal 
transduction, proliferation and apoptosis markers, (ii) mutation status of the EGFR gene, (iii) 
gene amplification, and (iv) other related biomarkers (see central laboratory manual for further 
details regarding sample collection, preparation and shipment).  Archival tumor tissue may be 
derived from tumor resections, tumor biopsies, pleural effusions, or other cytology samples, 
but should be presented as formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks or slides.

Time to deterioration in patient WHO Performance Status (TDPS) 

4.6.5.1  Methods of assessment 

WHO PS is recorded according to the study plan (see Tables 1, 2, and 3). 

4.6.5.2  Derivation or calculation of variable 

Baseline WHO PS is defined as the measurement recorded closest to, but not subsequent to, 
the first dose of ZACTIMA/Placebo or docetaxel.  At a given time point, deterioration in 
WHO PS is considered to be ≥1 change from baseline score.

TDPS is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the first assessment of 
‘deterioration.’ 

If a deterioration of WHO PS has not been observed at the time of analysis, TDPS will be 
censored as of the last non-missing WHO PS assessment date.

Safety measurements and variables 

The methods for collecting safety data are described below.  For a complete list of the safety 
objectives and outcome variables, please see Table 8 in Section 4.6. 

4.7.1 

Adverse events 

4.7.1.1  Definitions 

The definitions of AEs, SAEs, and other significant adverse events (OAEs) are given below.  
It is of the utmost importance that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content 
of this section.  The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring this. 

All AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0. 

Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be reported as an 
AE. 

Adverse event 

An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-
existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether 
or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition can be 
symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal 
results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, ECG).  In clinical studies, an AE can 
include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout 
periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 

For the purposes of this study, any detrimental change in a subject’s condition subsequent to 
them entering the study and during the 60-day follow-up period should be considered an AE.  
When there is a deterioration in the condition for which the study treatment is being used, 
there may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such cases, unless 
AstraZeneca or the reporting physician considers that study treatment contributed to the 
deterioration or local regulations state to the contrary the deterioration should be considered a 
lack of efficacy.  Signs and symptoms of disease progression are therefore not considered 
AEs. 

The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE.  New cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for administration of study treatment and have been identified after 
inclusion of the subject into the clinical study.

Drug Substance ZACTIMA™ (ZD6474)   
Study Code D4200C00032  
Edition Number 7.0 
Date 07MAY2007 

Serious adverse event 

A SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), 
and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or more 
of the following criteria: 

-  Results in death 

- 

Is immediately life-threatening 

-  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 

-  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 

- 

- 

Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 

Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 

Any event or hospitalization that is unequivocally due to progression of disease must not 
be reported as an SAE. 

The causality of SAEs (ie, their relationship to study treatment) will be assessed by the 
Investigator(s), who in completing the relevant eCRF must answer “yes” or “no” to the 
question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by any of the following – study medication – other medication?”.  For further guidance 
on the definition of a SAE and a guide to the interpretation of the causality question, see 
Appendix B to the Clinical Study Protocol. 

Note that SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure should also be reported. For 
such events the causal relationship is implied as “yes”.  SAE causality may be attributed either 
to docetaxel or ZACTIMA/placebo alone, to the combination of both drugs, or to neither drug.  
Toxicities that are expected with docetaxel in combination with placebo include hematologic, 
peripheral neuropathy, and fluid retention. 

SAEs will be collected from the time of informed consent and will be followed up until 
resolution or up to 60 days after administration of the last dose of trial treatment. 

Other Significant Adverse Events 

OAEs will be identified by the Study Delivery Team Physician in consultation with the 
appropriate Global Drug Safety Physician during the evaluation of safety data for the Clinical 
Study Report.  Significant AEs of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those 
AEs leading to discontinuation of the subject from study treatment, will be classified as 
OAEs.  Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and 
certain events that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose 
reduction or significant additional treatment.  For each OAE, a narrative may be written and 
included in the Clinical Study Report.

Deaths 

All deaths that occur during the study and follow-up period (both cancer-related and other) 
must be reported.  All deaths except those due to unequivocal progression of disease that 
occur within the study period or within 60 days after the administration of last dose of study 
treatment must be reported to the study monitor for the purposes of SAE reporting.  Deaths as 
a result of disease progression are not considered SAEs, but must be collected on the 
appropriate eCRF.  The site should continue to follow all subjects for survival beyond the 60-
day period after the administration of last dose of study treatment and collect information 
around the death on the appropriate eCRF. 

An AE form should be completed for all deaths except those due to unequivocal progression 
of disease.  The AE causing death must be reported to the study monitor as a SAE within 24 
hours.  The report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of 
disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death. 

Death as a result of progression of disease alone should be reported to the study monitor at the 
next monitoring visit and should be documented on the relevant eCRF, but should not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. 

4.7.1.2  Recording of adverse events 

AEs and SAEs will be collected throughout the study, from the time of informed consent until 
60 days after the last administration of study treatment and will be followed up to resolution. 

The following variables will be recorded for each AE:  onset, resolution, action taken, 
outcome, causality (yes or no), and whether it constitutes an SAE or not.  The NCI CTCAE, 
Version 3.0 grade should be recorded where applicable. 

All AEs will be recorded on the eCRFs provided.  A description of the event, including its 
date of onset and resolution, whether it constitutes a SAE or not, any action taken (e.g., 
changes to study treatment, other treatment given, and follow-up tests) and outcome, should 
be provided along with the Investigator’s assessment of causality (the relationship to the study 
treatment).  AEs will also be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0, and changes 
tracked on the relevant eCRF. 

For an AE to be a suspected drug-related event, there should be at least a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE (see Appendix B for 
guidelines on interpretation of causality). 

(a) 

Disease progression 

Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be reported as an 
AE. 

(b) 

Lack of efficacy

Date 07MAY2007 
When there is deterioration in the condition for which the study treatment is being used (i.e., 
NSCLC), there may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such 
cases, unless AstraZeneca or the reporting physician considers that the study treatment 
contributed to the deterioration, or local regulations state to the contrary, the deterioration 
should be considered to be a lack of efficacy and not an AE. 

(c) 

Abnormal laboratory values/vital signs 

The reporting of laboratory / vital signs abnormalities as both laboratory findings and AEs 
should be avoided.  They should not be reported as AEs unless any one of the following are 
met: 

-  Any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

The laboratory / vital signs abnormality causes the subject to discontinue from 
the study treatment 

The laboratory / vital signs abnormality causes the subject to interrupt the 
study treatment 

The laboratory / vital signs abnormality causes the subject to modify the dose 
of study treatment 

The laboratory / vital signs abnormality requires intervention 

The Investigator believes that the abnormality should be reported as an AE 

If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result or vital 
sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant eCRF.  
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA. 

A vendor to be selected by AstraZeneca will evaluate ECGs centrally, and results will be 
communicated to each site within 72 hours.  If a QTc prolongation is recorded, the vendor will 
inform the Investigator and AstraZeneca within 24 hours.  Any clinically significant abnormal 
findings and QTc prolongations during the treatment period will be recorded as AEs. 

(d) 

Overdose 

Should an overdose (accidental or deliberate) occur, it must be reported in accordance with the 
procedures described in Section 9.3, Procedures in case of overdose, regardless of whether the 
overdose was associated with any symptom or not.  All symptoms associated with the 
overdose should be reported as AEs.

Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported in accordance with the procedures described in 
Section 9.4, Procedures in case of pregnancy.  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE 
unless there is a suspicion that an investigational product may have interfered with the 
effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 

(f) 

Handling unresolved AE/SAEs at completion/withdrawal 

All study-related toxicities and SAEs must be followed until resolution or for 60 days after the 
last administration of study treatment, unless, in the Investigator’s opinion, the condition is 
unlikely to resolve due to the subject’s underlying disease. 

AEs will be coded using the MedDRA. 

4.7.1.3  Reporting of serious adverse events 

Investigators and other site personnel must inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives of 
any SAE that occurs in the course of the study within 1 day (ie, immediately but no later than 
the end of the next business day) of when he or she becomes aware of it. 

Follow-up information on SAEs must also be reported by the Investigator within the same 
time frames. 

If a non-serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow-up information must also 
be provided to AstraZeneca within 1 day as described above.  For a non-serious AE that 
become serious but which is not fatal or life-threatening a report should be received within 
5 days. 

The AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to compile all the necessary 
information and ensure that the appropriate AstraZeneca Drug Safety Department receives a 
report by Day 1 for all fatal and life-threatening cases and by Day 5 for all other SAEs. 

All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product or to the study procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.  The 
Investigator is responsible for informing the Ethics Committee and/or the Regulatory 
Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.  For studies in countries implementing the EU 
Clinical Trials Directive, this will be taken care of by AstraZeneca (see section 8.1). 

4.7.2 

Laboratory safety measurements and variables 

A central laboratory vendor to be selected by AstraZeneca will be utilized for laboratory 
procedures. 

4.7.2.1  Methods of assessment

ECG, Vital Signs and physical examination 

4.7.3.1 

12-lead ECG methods of assessment 

A single 12-lead ECG must be performed at screening (within 21 days of first dose).  The 
screening QTc must be <480 msec. If the single screening QTc is ≥480 msec (≥460 msec for 
subjects who are receiving one of the drugs listed in Appendix D, Table 2 –see Exclusion 
Criteria #18), then the Investigator has the option to perform up to an additional 2 ECGs so 
that a maximum of 3 ECGs (each at least 24 hours apart) may be obtained at screening.  The 
QTc value used to determine eligibility would be the average of the QTc values obtained at 
screening. If a subject is receiving one of the medications in Appendix D, Group 2 prior to 

69(87) 

Amended Clinical Study Protocol

study entry, and it cannot be discontinued before study treatment, then the screening QTc 
must be <460msec, and an additional ECG must be obtained 4-8 hours after the first dose of 
ZD6474.   

Baseline QTc (using the Bazett’s correction) will be determined by the average of no less than 
3 consecutive ECGs (within 5-10 minutes of one another) on Day 1. 

When possible ECGs should be performed at the same time throughout the study.  ECGs must 
be performed 4-8 hours after the subject takes their oral medication on assessment day at 
Visits 3, 5, 8, 10 (weeks 2, 4, 7, 13), and then every 3 months until discontinuation of 
ZACTIMA/placebo.  An additional ECG must be performed at discontinuation.  If 
ZACTIMA/placebo has been discontinued, the ECG assessments are not required.  In the 
event of QTc prolongation, the QTc will be re-evaluated within 48 hours with no less than 3 
consecutive ECGs (within 5-10 minutes of one another).  The criteria for QTc prolongation 
are: 

-  A single QTc value of ≥550 msec, or an increase of ≥100 msec from baseline; 

OR 

- 

Two consecutive QTc measurements, within 48 hours of one another, where 
either of the following criteria are met for both QTc values (the second being 
the mean of 3 consecutive ECGs): 

  A QTc interval of ≥500 msec, but <550 msec; 

OR 

  An increase of ≥60 msec, but <100 msec from baseline QTc, to a value 

≥480 msec 

In the event of a QTc prolongation see Section 3.2.2.2. 

PK sampling will be taken close to or at the same time as the ECGs.  The time of each visit 
does not have to be exactly the same; only the assessment (i.e., ECG and PK) sample at a 
particular visit needs to be taken at the same time.  Whenever possible the assessments should 
be carried out at the same time of day. 

A vendor to be selected by AstraZeneca will evaluate ECGs.  A cardiologist at the vendor will 
review all ECGs for the presence of QTc prolongation or other abnormalities, in particular any 
changes in the T-wave morphology that would suggest a higher likelihood for the 
development of any arrhythmia.  Any clinically significant abnormal findings or QTc 
prolongations during this period will be recorded as AEs.

date and time of ECG, heart rate (beats/min), QRS duration (ms), PR interval (ms), QT 
interval (ms), QTcB interval (ms), QTcF interval (ms), sinus rhythm (yes/no) and overall 
evaluation (normal/abnormal). 

4.7.3.3  Vital signs and physical examinations methods of assessment 

Full physical examinations will be performed including height (screening only), weight, blood 
pressure, pulse, and temperature at the screening visit and as outlined in the study plan. Blood 
pressure should be measured after the subject has been sitting for 5 minutes. 

Performance status will be assessed using the WHO criteria (Appendix C) at baseline and as 
outlined in the study plan.  The same observer should assess performance status each time. 

4.7.3.4  Vital signs and physical examinations derivation or calculation of outcome 

variables 

Any new conditions reported during the study will be recorded on the AE forms.  Only those 
findings that are in addition to the condition being treated will be recorded as AEs, see Section 
4.7.1.2 for reporting of AEs.  Conditions that are considered by the Investigator to be 
unequivocally disease-related will not be recorded as AEs.

4.8.1 

Analysis of biological samples 

4.8.1.1  Clinical chemistry samples 

The analyte stability limits defined by the central laboratory vendor will be applied to all 
analyses performed on behalf of AstraZeneca.  The central laboratory vendor will not analyze 
samples that fall outside these stability limits.  Analytical data will not be reported if found to 
have been derived from a sample that fell outside these stability limits.  The standards of 
procedure followed by the central laboratory vendor may be amended in accordance with its 
Standard Operating Procedures.  The central laboratory vendor will inform AstraZeneca of the 
stability limits relevant to this study before the first subject gives informed consent to take part 
in the study. 

If the central laboratory vendor chooses to sub-contract the analytical work to another 
laboratory, the central laboratory vendor must assure itself and provide assurance to 
AstraZeneca that the other laboratory will apply defined stability limits to all analyses 
performed on behalf of AstraZeneca.  Samples falling outside these limits must not be 
analyzed or data reported.  The other laboratory will inform AstraZeneca of the stability limits 
relevant to this study before the first subject gives informed consent to take part in the study. 

4.8.1.2  Pharmacokinetic samples 

The long-term stability of the analyte(s) should be documented in method validation produced 
by AstraZeneca DMPK.  Results from analyses of samples stored longer than the time period 
for which stability has been demonstrated should not be reported unless complementary 
analyte(s) stability data is acquired and amended to the relevant method validation report.  
Stability of ZACTIMA has been documented for 12 months in work done by AstraZeneca.  
Samples stored for longer than 12 months will not be analyzed.

a central database and changes tracked to provide an audit trail.  When data have been entered 
reviewed, edited and Source Data Verification (SDV) performed the Principal Investigator 
will be notified to sign the eCRF electronically as per the agreed project process and data will 
be locked to prevent further editing.  A copy of the eCRF will be archived at the study site. 

Appropriate documentation will accompany the PK samples during shipment.  The PK data 
(plasma concentrations) will be fully validated by the Drug Metabolism Pharmacokinetics 
(DMPK) at AstraZeneca, then sent in the form of a protected Excel spreadsheet directly to the 
study team programmer for loading into AstraZeneca’s statistical analysis software (SAS). 

The plasma concentration data and doses for the subjects will be tabulated by the study team 
programmer and forwarded to Clinical Pharmacokinetics, who will complete the derived 
parameters and return to the programmer for loading into SAS. 

Unblinded PK and pharmacodynamic biomarker data will not be accessed by AstraZeneca 
staff affiliated with the conduct of the study prior to database lock.

Description of analysis sets 

Efficacy data from this study will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using randomized 
treatment.  There will be two co-primary analysis populations:  the first will comprise all 
subjects; the second will comprise all female subjects. 

In addition, a per protocol analysis excluding significant protocol deviators will be carried out 
for the primary analysis of PFS and OS.  This will be done for both co-primary analysis 
populations. 

The safety data for this study will be summarized using treatment received.  The analysis 
population will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of ZACTIMA/placebo. 

6.4 

Method of statistical analysis 

At the time of the final analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS, OS will also be analyzed. 

The analyses for PFS, OS, TDS, and TDPS will be performed using the log-rank test 
(unadjusted model with treatment factor only) in the ITT population. 

For PFS, OS, TDS, and TDPS, a Cox’s proportional hazards regression model will also be 
performed as a secondary analysis.  The model will allow for the effect of treatment and will 
also include terms for tumor stage, number of organs involved, prior Avastin failures, 
histology, smoking history, gender (except for the co-primary analysis population assessing 
female subjects only), ethnic origin, EGFR expression, EGFR gene amplification and EGFR 
mutation status.  The conclusion will be based on the unadjusted analysis, which is considered 
as primary.  If the unadjusted analysis and the adjusted analysis yield different results, the 
consequences of the covariate adjustment will be explored. 

A global test for the presence of the treatment by baseline covariate interactions will be 
performed at the 1% level of significance by including all the 2-way treatment by baseline 
covariate interactions in the model.  The assumptions of proportionality will also be 
investigated with a time-dependent exploratory variable, which is defined as treatment 
*{log(time to event)}.  If the p-value from the Wald Chi-squared statistic for this variable is 
less than 5% there is evidence of a departure from the adjusted model assumptions.  In this 
case, the reason will be explored and reported in the statistical text. 

The comparison of treatments will be estimated using the HR together with the corresponding 
two-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) and p-value. 

In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed on PFS and OS.  The subgroups to be 
explored will be the same factors included as covariates in adjusted Cox’s proportional hazard 
model, as described above. 

PFS, OS, TDS, and TDPS will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods.  Kaplan-Meier 
plots and Kaplan-Meier estimates of median time to event will be presented by randomized 
treatment group.

Date 07MAY2007 
The primary analysis of ORR will be analyzed using logistic regression including treatment 
factor only.  A secondary analysis will also be performed where the logistic regression model 
will allow for the effect of treatment and will also include terms for tumor stage, number of 
organs involved, prior Avastin failures, histology, smoking history, gender (except for the co-
primary analysis population assessing female subjects only), ethnic origin, EGFR expression 
and EGFR mutation status.  The conclusion will be based on the unadjusted analysis, which is 
considered as primary.  If the unadjusted analysis and the adjusted analysis yield different 
results, the consequences of the covariate adjustment will be explored.  The results of the 
analyses will be presented in terms of odds ratios together with associated CIs and 2-sided p-
values.  The estimates of the differences in the response rates and the corresponding 2-sided 
97.5% CIs will also be presented. 

Duration of response will be summarized in 2 ways (see Section 4.6.3.2) using the Kaplan-
Meier method.  Kaplan-Meier plots and Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median duration of 
response will be presented for the responders in each treatment group. 

The focus of the statistical analysis of QoL assessments will be on the LCS and the TOI 
scores.  Other QoL scores (individual subscales scores and the total FACT-L scores) will be 
summarized only.  These analyses are exploratory in nature.  Data will be summarized over 
time in terms of mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum and number of 
subjects for each treatment group.  Graphical displays will also be presented.  For LCS and 
TOI scores, a mixed model using the repeated measures approach will be fitted to the data.  
The analysis will include all non-missing visit scores and the model will include terms for 
treatment, baseline score, time of assessment, tumor stage, number of organs involved, prior 
Avastin failures, histology, smoking history, gender, ethnic origin, EGFR expression and 
EGFR mutation status.  The results of the analyses will be presented in terms of adjusted 
means for each treatment, estimated effect for the treatment comparison, associated CI and p-
value.  In addition, summary tables will be produced to investigate the relationship between 
TDS and duration of PFS. 

WHO PS scores will be summarized over time for each treatment group using appropriate 
summary statistics.  In addition, summary tables will be produced to investigate the 
relationship between TDPS and duration of PFS. 

Safety and tolerability data will be presented by treatment received.  Appropriate summaries 
of these data will be presented.  Safety and tolerability will be assessed in terms of AEs, 
laboratory data, and ECG changes which will be collected for all subjects.  Data from all 
cycles and treatment periods will be combined in the presentation of safety data.  AEs (both in 
terms of MedDRA preferred terms and CTCAE grade), laboratory data and ECG data will be 
listed individually by subject and summarized by treatment received.  For subjects who have a 
dose modification, all AE data (due to toxicity or otherwise) will be assigned to the initial 
treatment received group.  ECG changes will be summarized for each treatment group. 

Vital signs data will be listed for each subject and changes in vital signs will be summarized 
for each treatment group.

6.5 

Determination of sample size 

The primary endpoint of this study is PFS.  Two trials have been used to estimate the median 
PFS for docetaxel alone.  Based on the Phase II, second-line, randomized trial, 
ZD6474IL/0006, assessing docetaxel alone versus docetaxel in combination with ZACTIMA 
100 mg, a median time to progression of 3 months was observed for the docetaxel alone 
treatment arm.  Similarly, based on the docetaxel study 317 (Shepherd et al, 2000) the median 
PFS in this study was also approximately 3 months for docetaxel alone.  Therefore for the 
sample size estimation a median PFS of 3 months has been assumed for the docetaxel alone 
arm. 

The final analysis of PFS will be performed when a minimum of 1176 events have been 
observed.  The nominal 2-sided significance level for all analyses will be 2.5%, except for the 
primary endpoint of PFS and the secondary endpoint of overall survival, where the nominal 
significance level will be adjusted to approximately 2.44% to allow for a single interim 
analysis. 

In order to detect a 25% prolongation of progression with >90% power, assuming a non-linear 
recruitment period of 19 months and a minimum follow-up of 3 months; i.e. the total length of 
trial is estimated to be 22 months to observe the required number of events, a minimum of 
1380 subjects with locally advanced or metastatic (IIIb-IV) NSCLC after failure of 1st line 
anti-cancer therapy will be recruited.  This equates to 3-week improvement in the median time 
to progression; i.e. a 3.75-month median PFS on the docetaxel in combination with 
ZACTIMA 100 mg arm. 

Feasibility assessment in Japan suggests that 140 subjects can be recruited within the time-
frame of the overall study.  If the treatment effect in Japan differs from the treatment effect for 
subjects recruited outside of Japan such that there is a 25% prolongation of PFS for ZD6474 
plus docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone in subjects recruited outside of Japan and a 25% 
deficit for subjects recruited in Japan (or vice versa), then a study which includes 140 subjects 
recruited in Japan and 1240 subjects recruited outside of Japan will have >80% power to 
detect this interaction at a 2-sided significance level of 10%.  The recruitment of 140 subjects 
in Japan would represent approximately 10% of the overall total of 1380 subjects. 

In the event of a treatment by country interaction with Japan, the power of the analysis to 
detect a 25% prolongation of PFS for subjects recruited outside of Japan would be >90%. 

Chinese regulatory requirements state that 100 subjects per group are required to gain 
registration in this country.  In the event of a treatment by country interaction with China, the 
power of the analysis to detect a 25% prolongation of progression would be >90% for subjects 
recruited outside of China.

In the event of a treatment by country interaction with both Japan and China the power of the 
analysis to detect a 25% prolongation of progression would be >80% for subjects recruited 
outside of Japan and China. 

It is assumed that the ratio of female:male subjects in this study will be 1:1.  In the co-primary 
analysis population assessing females there will be >90% power to detect a 37.5% 
prolongation of progression, assuming the same recruitment details as the overall population.  
This equates to a 4.875 week improvement in the median time to progression in female 
subjects; i.e. a 4.125 month median PFS on the docetaxel in combination with ZACTIMA 100 
mg arm. 

In the event of a treatment by country interaction with Japan, the power of the analysis to 
detect a 37.5% prolongation of progression would be >90% for female subjects recruited 
outside of Japan. 

In the event of a treatment by country interaction with China, the power of the analysis to 
detect a 37.5% prolongation of progression would be >90% for female subjects recruited 
outside of China. 

In the event of a treatment by country interaction with both Japan and China, the power of the 
analysis to detect a 37.5% prolongation of progression would be >80% for female subjects 
recruited outside of Japan and China. 

Based on the docetaxel study 317 (Shepherd et al, 2000) and 320 (Fossella et al, 2000) the 
median OS in these studies were 7.5 months (n=55) and 5.7 months (n=125), respectively.  
Therefore it is estimated that the median OS in this study will be 6 months for docetaxel 
alone.  The analysis of survival will be conducted at the time of the analysis of the primary 
endpoint of PFS.  It is estimated that 850 events (deaths) will have occurred at this time, and 
the power to detect a 25% prolongation of survival would be >80%.  This equates to a 1.5 
month improvement in the median overall survival; ie a 7.5 month median OS on the 
docetaxel in combination with ZACTIMA 100 mg arm. 

6.6 

Interim analyses 

The IDMC will review the study data every three months, and could recommend terminating 
the study at any stage if in the committee’s judgment, the relationship between potential 
benefits and risks to subjects were to become unacceptable. 

A single interim analysis to assess superiority of the PFS and overall survival endpoints will 
be performed when approximately 588 PFS events have occurred in the overall population.  If 
exactly 588 events overall are reported at the time of the interim analysis, the nominal 
significance levels for these tests will be 0.14% (O’Brien et al, 1979, S+SEQTRIAL, 2002).  
The exact nominal significance level will be determined based on the exact number of events 
at the time of the interim analysis.

Independent Data Monitoring Committee 

This trial will use an external IDMC, comprising of at least 3 individuals who are not 
employed by AstraZeneca, and do not have major conflicts of interest.  The remit and function 
of the IDMC is specified in Supplement 2. 

7. 

7.1 

STUDY MANAGEMENT 

Monitoring 

Before first subject into the study, a representative of AstraZeneca will visit the 
investigational study site to: 

- 

- 

determine the adequacy of the facilities 

discuss with the Investigator(s) (and other personnel involved with the study) 
their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the 
responsibilities of AstraZeneca or its representatives.  This will be 
documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between AstraZeneca and the 
Investigator 

During the study, a monitor from AstraZeneca or company representing AstraZeneca will 
have regular contacts with the study site, including visits to: 

- 

- 

- 

- 

provide information and support to the Investigator(s) 

confirm that facilities remain acceptable 

confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed 

perform SDV (a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the subject’s 
medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the 
study).  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject 
(eg, clinic charts). 

The monitor or another AstraZeneca representative will be available between visits if the 
Investigator(s) or other staff at the center need information and advice.

7.2 

Audits and inspections 

Authorized representatives of AstraZeneca, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) or an Institutional Review Board (IRB) may visit the center to perform 
audits or inspections, including SDV.  The purpose of an AstraZeneca audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and any applicable regulatory 
requirements.  The Investigator should contact AstraZeneca immediately if contacted by a 
regulatory agency about an inspection at his or her center. 

7.3 

Training of staff 

The Principal Investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study 
(medical, nursing and other staff).  He or she will ensure that appropriate training relevant to 
the study is given to all of these staff, and that any new information of relevance to the 
performance of this study is forwarded to the staff involved. 

7.4 

Changes to the protocol 

Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the Co-ordinating 
Investigator and AstraZeneca. 

If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended, the amendment or a new version of the 
study protocol (Amended Protocol) must be notified to or approved by each IRB or IEC, and 
if applicable, also the local regulatory authority, before implementation.  Local requirements 
must be followed. 

If a protocol amendment requires a change to a particular center’s Informed Consent Form, 
then AstraZeneca and the center’s IRB or IEC must be notified.  Approval of the revised 
Informed Consent Form by AstraZeneca and by the IRB or IEC is required before the revised 
form is used. 

AstraZeneca will distribute amendments and new versions of the protocol to each Principal 
Investigator(s), who in turn is responsible for the distribution of these documents to his or her 
IRB or IEC, and to the staff at his or her center.  The distribution of these documents to the 
regulatory authority will be handled according to local practice. 

7.5 

Study agreements 

The Principal Investigator at each center must comply with all the terms, conditions, and 
obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement for this study.  In the event of any inconsistency 
between this Clinical Study Protocol and the Clinical Study Agreement, the Clinical Study 
Protocol shall prevail.

Study timetable and end of study 

Before a subject's enrolment in the study and any study-related procedures are undertaken the 
following should be fulfilled: 

- 

- 

- 

signed Clinical Study Protocol and other agreements between AstraZeneca 
and the Principal Investigator/Study Site. 

approval of the study by the IRB/IEC 

approval of the study, if applicable, by the regulatory authority 

The approximate date of enrollment of the first subject is expected in March 2006 and the 
approximate date when the last subject is expected to have completed the study is February 
2008.  The Investigator will be notified by AstraZeneca when recruitment is completed.  The 
end of study will be declared once a program has been established that allows all remaining 
subjects still receiving ZACTIMA study treatment to receive open-label supplies after the 
final analysis of the trial has occurred. 

8. 

8.1 

ETHICS 

Ethics review 

The final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Form, must be 
approved or given a favorable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC as appropriate.  The 
Investigator must submit written approval to AstraZeneca before he or she can enroll any 
subject into the study. 

The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the 
protocol in accordance with local requirements.  In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all 
advertising used to recruit subjects for the study.  The protocol must be re-approved by the 
IRB or IEC annually, as local regulations require. 

The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any serious and 
unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational 
product.  AstraZeneca will provide this information to the Principal Investigator. 

Progress reports and notifications of serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions will be 
provided to the IRB or IEC according to local regulations and guidelines. 

For all countries except the US, AstraZeneca will provide IECs and Principal Investigators 
with safety updates/reports according to local requirements.  For the US, each PI is 
responsible for submitting all safety updates/reports to the IRB for their study site.

The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/GCP, applicable regulatory requirements 
and the AstraZeneca policy on Bioethics. 

8.3 

Informed consent 

The Principal Investigator(s) at each center will ensure that the subject is given full and 
adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of 
the study.  Subjects must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at 
any time.  The subject should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to 
consider the information provided. 

The subject’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any 
procedure specifically for the study. 

The Principal Investigator(s) must store the original, signed Informed Consent Form.  A copy 
of the signed Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject. 

If modifications are made according to local requirements, the new version has to be approved 
by AstraZeneca. 

8.4 

Subject data protection 

The Master Informed Consent Form will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a 
separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and 
privacy legislation. Pursuant to this wording, subjects will authorize the collection, use and 
disclosure of their study data by the Investigator and by those persons who need that 
information for the purposes of the study. 

The Master Informed Consent Form will explain that study data will be stored in a computer 
database, maintaining confidentiality in accordance with national data legislation.  All data 
computer processed by AstraZeneca will be identified by subject number, study code, and 
subject initials. 

The Master Informed Consent Form will also explain that for data verification purposes, 
authorized representatives of AstraZeneca, a regulatory authority, an IRB or IEC may require 
direct access to parts of the hospital or practice records relevant to the study, including 
subjects’ medical history.

9.2 

Procedures in case of medical emergency 

The Principal Investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are 
available to handle medical emergencies during the study.  A medical emergency usually 
constitutes an SAE and should be reported as such, see Section 4.7.1.1. 

9.3 

Procedures in case of overdose 

There is currently no known antidote to ZACTIMA.  In the event of an overdose (> 1 dose 
within 24 hours), symptomatic and supportive care should be given, and all details should be 
recorded. 

 

An overdose with associated SAEs should be recorded as the SAE 
diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE forms in the eCRFs.

Amended Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZACTIMA™ (ZD6474)   
Study Code D4200C00032  
Edition Number 7.0 
Date 07MAY2007 
 

An overdose with associated non-serious AEs should be recorded as the AE 
diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE forms in the eCRFs.  In addition, the 
overdose should be reported on the separate AZ “Clinical Study Overdose Report 
Form.” 

 

An overdose without associated symptoms should not be recorded as an AE in the 
eCRFs.  The overdose should be reported on the separate AZ “Clinical Study 
Overdose Report Form” 

In the event of an overdose of docetaxel, appropriate measures must be taken in accordance 
with the prescribing information of docetaxel 

9.4 

Procedures in case of pregnancy 

In the event of pregnancy occurring while a subject is receiving ZACTIMA/placebo, the study 
drug should be discontinued and AstraZeneca should be contacted for advice. 

Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, 
normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the 
subject was discontinued from the study. 

All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages 
should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications 
should not be handled as AEs.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to AstraZeneca 
on the pregnancy outcomes report form. 

As for docetaxel, refer to the prescribing information.
