STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

Determination of sample size: 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Randomization 
Treatment  allocation  will  be  done  centrally  using  an 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). 
Randomization  will  be  stratified  in  order  to  balance 
treatments  allocation  according 
following 
prognostic factors: 

the 

to 

-  Number of metastatic organs involved (1,≥2) 
-  Oxaliplatin  as  part  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy 

(Yes, No) 

-  Bevacizumab (Yes, No) 

 

 

Primary efficacy analysis: neuroprotection 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the intent 
to treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients). 
The probability of occurrence of Grade 3-4 PSN relative 
to  the  cumulative  dose  of  oxaliplatin  will  be  estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between 
the  two  treatment  groups  using  a  2-sided  logrank  test 
with a type I error of 0.05. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Main secondary endpoint: Response Rate 

 

 
  would  be  sufficient  to 
demonstrate non-inferiority in response rate between the 
treatment arm and the control arm with a 85% power, a 
type  I  error  of  0.025  (one-sided  test)  and  a  non-
inferiority margin of 0.8. 
 
Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the lower bound 
of the 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval of the ratio of 
the response rates is at least 0.80. Response rate will be 
summarized  by  treatment  group  using  counts  and 
percentages. 
 
Other secondary endpoints: 
Neuroprotection : 
Overall  PSN  incidence  (Grades  1,  2,  3-4),  treatment 
discontinuation,  dose-reduction  and  dose-delay  due  to 
cumulative  PSN  will  be  summarized  using  descriptive 
statistics. 
Dose  to  onset  and  duration  of  cumulative  PSN  will  be 
analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Change  in  NCS  will  be  summarized  with  descriptive 
statistics.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
(continued) 

DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD 
(per Patient) 
 

 
Chemotherapy efficacy: 
Time-related  parameters 
(PFS  and  OS)  will  be 
summarized with median and 95% CI, estimated by the 
Kaplan-Meier method. 
 
Safety analysis: 
Safety  analyses 
(exposures,  AEs,  SAEs,  clinical 
laboratory  evaluations,  vital  signs)  will  be  summarized 
on 
the  safety  population  (treated  patients),  using 
descriptive statistics. 
 
 
•  Anti-cancer 

therapy  will  consist  of  2-week 

treatment cycles up to disease progression. 

•  Patients will be followed for progression, regardless 
of  the  number  of  cycles  received,  until  it  is 
documented  or  for  13  months  after  the  first 
administration  of  chemotherapy,  whichever  comes 
first. 

•  Prevention of PSN with study drug will start at the 
time of the first chemotherapy dosing and will last: 
-Up  to  oxaliplatin  discontinuation  (i.e.  15  days 
following  the  last  infusion  of  oxaliplatin)  in  the 
absence  of  PSN  Grade  >1  at  the  end  of  treatment 
with oxaliplatin 
-Up  to  resolution  of  PSN  and  for  a  maximum  of  
3 months following last oxaliplatin infusion in case 
of  PSN  Grade  >1  at  the  end  of  treatment  with 
oxaliplatin 

•  Post 

treatment  observation  for  all  Treatment 
Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be done up 
to 30 days after last administration of study drug. 

•  Patients  with  persisting  PSN  at  that  point  will  be 
followed  for  resolution  once  every  2  months  (in 
case  disease  progression  is  not  yet  documented) 
or/then  once  every  3  months  (after  disease 
progression  is  documented)  depending  on  their 
progression status.

a: Screening evalution to be done within 7 days of first dosing with exception of Nerve Conduction Studies, ECG and imaging for tumor measurements 

which have to be done within 14 days, 21days and 28 days respectively prior to first dosing. 

b: Serum chemistry: Baseline work-up will include sodium, potassium, chloride, BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen), serum creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, total 
bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total cholesterol, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The same work-up 
will be repeated every 8 weeks, up to the end of treatment with study drug and at the 30-day Follow-up visit post last study drug administration. During 
the period of chemotherapy, and when this full work-up is not required, a limited pre-dose work-up will be done. It will include sodium, potassium, 
chloride, BUN, glucose and serum creatinine. 

c: Nerve Conduction Studies: A first set will be performed within 14 days prior to randomization. A second one will be done at the end of the treatment 
with oxaliplatin. For  the  patients  reporting PSN≤ Grade 1  at  that  time  (i.e. who will  stop  study  drug as  well)  this  second  set will  be done at  30-day 
Follow-up visit. For the patients reporting PSN > Grade 1 at that time (i.e. who are continuing treatment with study drug for up to a maximum of 3 
months  following  discontinuation  of  oxaliplatin)  the  second  set  of  NCS  will  be  done  at  the  first  monthly  visit  following  oxaliplatin  discontinuation. 
These patients, who are continuing treatment with study drug beyond discontinuation of oxaliplatin, will have a third NCS. It will be done at the 30-day 
Follow-up visit following their discontinuation of treatment with study drug. 

d: Following oxaliplatin discontinuation for other reason than progressive disease, patients will continue to be followed for disease progression ( i.e. q8 
weeks for imaging, and, when applicable for CEA) until it is documented or for 13 months after the first administration of chemotherapy, whichever 
comes first. 

e: After 30-day Follow-up visit, patients with persisting PSN, whatever the grade is, will continue to be followed for PSN recovery. The schedule of the 
evaluations  will  depend  on  the  patient  disease  status.  If  progressive  disease  is  not  yet  documented,  evaluations  will  be  performed  along  imaging 
evaluation visits, i.e. q8 weeks. For patients with documented progressive disease, evaluations will be done along with survival documentation, i.e. every 
3 months. Dates of grade change and date of PSN recovery will be captured in the CRF. 

f: During screening, all symptoms occurring prior to first study drugs administration will be reported either in the “past medical or surgical history” section 
or  in  the  “signs  and  symptoms  present  at  baseline”  section  of  the  CRF.  If  a  serious  adverse  event  occurs  before  treatment,  it  is  to  be  reported  and 
recorded on the CRF SAE form.

4.  INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 

4.1 Background and Rationale 

 

4.1.1 Introduction 

The  limiting  factor  of  chemotherapy  is  the  narrow  therapeutic  index.  Improving  the 
therapeutic index may be achieved through the use of agents protecting the normal tissues 
against the deleterious side-effects of cytotoxic treatments. These agents should reduce the 
toxicity  without  compromising  the  established  clinical  benefit  of  the  anticancer  therapy. 
Furthermore, they should not be associated with toxicities that might increase the patient’s 
burden and/or interfere with the adequate delivery of the chemotherapy. 
 
Oxaliplatin  has  been  associated  with  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  which  in  its  severe 
manifestations  may  cause  functional  impairments  that  potentially  have  an  impact  on 
activities  of  daily  living  (ADLs),  lead  to  treatment  adjustments  and  treatment 
discontinuations and represent therefore a dose limiting toxicity. 
 
Xaliproden  is  an  orally  active  non-peptide  compound  that  possesses  neurotrophic  like 
activity.  The  mechanism  of  action,  although  not  fully elucidated, indicates the ability to 
minimize  experimentally-induced  degeneration  of  neurons  and  to  accelerate  recovery  in 
sensory-motor function. 
 
In vitro data suggest that xaliproden has a neuroprotective potential against chemotherapy 
induced peripheral neuropathy, including oxaliplatin induced neuropathy. 
In  addition,  xaliproden  was  shown  not  to  impair  the  in vitro  antiproliferative  activity  of 
oxaliplatin on several cancer cell lines, the in vivo antitumor efficacy of oxaliplatin and 5-
FU in colon cancer bearing mice. 
 
These  findings  suggest  that  xaliproden  could  be  useful  in  preventing  and  in  improving 
time  to  recovery  from  oxaliplatin  induced  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (PSN)  without 
compromising   the anti-tumor activity of oxaliplatin. 
 
In  a  first  randomized,  multinational,  placebo  controlled  study  (XENOX,  EFC4972)  in 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving first-line treatment with the FOLFOX4 
regimen,  xaliproden  was  shown  to  statistically  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of  Grade  3 
PSN by 39% compared to placebo without negatively impacting on the response rate to 
chemotherapy. In this study xaliproden, administered 1 mg daily from start to end of the 
chemotherapy, has been well tolerated. 
 
The objective of the current multicenter, randomized placebo controlled Phase III trial is 
to further confirm the results of the XENOX study. In addition, the ability of xaliproden to 
reduce the duration of PSN events that are not prevented will be evaluated.

4.1.2 Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral sensory neuropathy 

Oxaliplatin-induced  sensory  neuropathy  has  been  reported  consistently  across  trials  to 
affect more than 80 % of the patients. It includes 2 distinct clusters of symptoms: an acute 
and transient paresthetic syndrome and a cumulative dose peripheral sensory neuropathy 
that develops upon repetition of treatment cycles.  
 
The acute syndrome may appear at the first cycle of treatment with oxaliplatin and often 
recurs  upon  subsequent  cycles.  It  consists  of  transient  distal  extremity  and  peri-oral 
paresthesias  or  dysesthesias  that  are  often  triggered  or  exacerbated  by  exposure  to  cold 
and usually resolve within hours or days. Other acute symptoms include cramps, muscular 
spasms, jaw pains. In up to 2% of the patients a transient pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia, 
causing a feeling of difficulty in breathing, has been reported. This later syndrome, when 
observed,  did  not  recur  upon  re-challenge  with  a  prolonged  (2  to  6  hour)  duration  of 
oxaliplatin  infusion.  Overall  acute  symptoms  are  reported  in  more  than  70  %  of  the 
patients treated with oxaliplatin. 
 
The  acute  symptoms  are  attributed  to  hyper-excitability  of  the  motor  neurons  and  are 
associated  with  hypo-calcemia  and  hypo-magnesemia.  Sural  nerve  biopsies  in  patients 
who had experienced acute symptoms did not show any meaningful changes in neuronal 
morphology  (1).  Because  of  similarities  of  the  symptoms  to  that  observed  in 
neuromyotonia  or  reported  with  natural  neurotoxin,  it  was  hypothesized  that  oxaliplatin 
would  act  on  voltage  dependent  Na+    channel  and  trigger  acute  symptoms.  Preclinical 
studies provide evidence that oxaliplatin induces prolonged sodium channel activation and 
sodium  current  changes  at  the  cellular  level  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5) (6).  Limited  experience  with 
carbamazepine, a sodium channel blocker, showed contradictory results. Favorable effects 
on acute symptoms were reported by Lersh (7), while Wilson did not confirm these results 
(8). Gabapentine was tested as well in a limited number of patients with some beneficial 
effects (9).  Divalent cations (calcium gluconate, magnesium sulfate), the concentration of 
which  in  the  extra-cellular  compartment  increases  the  probability  of  sodium  channel 
closing, showed, in a retrospective analysis, beneficial effect on acute symptoms (10). 
 
Overall, as of today, there is not enough evidence available to warrant the use of any agent 
to treat the acute syndrome. 
 
Because the acute syndrome is distinctive from the persistent neuronal damage xaliproden 
is not expected to impact its incidence. 
 
The  second  component  is  a  dose-limiting  cumulative  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy, 
which severity and duration progressively increases with continuation of treatment cycles. 
It is characterized by distal paresthesias that become persistent. In its severe form, there is 
an  occurrence  of  functional  disorders  affecting  the  ADLs  of  patients.  When  functional 
disorders interfering with ADLs  become persistent treatment has to be discontinued. At 
the  dose  85  mg/m²  of  oxaliplatin  once  every  2  weeks  the  reported  incidence  of  severe 
cumulative  persistent  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (PSN)  ranged  from  15  to  20%  in 
patients with MCRC. The median cumulative dose to onset was 874 mg/m² (10-11 cycles

or at least 5 months of full dose treatment). The risk of experiencing a Grade 3 neuropathy 
is  consistently  of  about  18-20%  for  a  cumulative  dose  of  1000  mg/m²  (12  cycles  -  6 
months of treatment). The symptoms usually regress after treatment discontinuation. 
 
The  exact  pathophysiology  of  the  oxaliplatin-induced  cumulative  dose  PSN  is  not  fully 
elucidated. As with cisplatin, accumulation of the product has been identified in the dorsal 
root ganglion cells (11) (12) (13). Clinically this neuropathy resembles that reported with 
cisplatin. However, no substantial ototoxicity was reported with oxaliplatin (14). As with 
cisplatin the motor neurons are relatively spared. 
 
Only few data were published on the prevention and on the treatment of cumulative PSN 
induced by oxaliplatin. 
 
In  a  small  (26  patients  per  arm)  double  blind  randomized  study,  glutathione,  an 
antioxidant agent that prevents initial accumulation of platinum compounds in dorsal root 
ganglia,  demonstrated  a  reduced  incidence  of  cumulative  PSN  (15).  In  a  retrospective 
analysis  from  a  compassionate  program,  patients  treated  with  celecoxib  and  oxaliplatin 
were reported not to experience oxaliplatin-induced Grade 3-4 PSN while an incidence of 
6%  was  reported  in  the  patients  who  did  not  receive  celecoxib  (16).  Alpha  lipoic  acid, 
which has been shown to be effective in patients with diabetic neuropathy, has been tested 
in  a  cohort  of  15  patients  with  established  oxaliplatin-induced  PSN  ≥  Grade  2.  Results 
suggested that alpha lipoic acid might have a beneficial effect on time to recovery (17). 
 
Overall, none of these clinical experiences provided convincing evidences to recommend 
the  use  of  any  of  these  agents  in  order  to  prevent  occurrence,  to  reduce  severity  or  to 
reduce time to recovery of cumulative PSN in patients being treated with oxaliplatin. 
 
4.1.3 Xaliprodren, summary of preclinical data in relation with oxaliplatin-induced 
neuropathy 

In  vitro,  xaliproden  has  been  described  by  Ruigt  in  1996  to  be  neuroprotective  against 
toxicity induced by cisplatin (18). Similar results were reported with oxaliplatin (19). In a 
co-culture  of  schwann  cells  and  Dorsal  Root  ganglia  (DRG)  explants  oxaliplatin  (1µM) 
induced a marked alteration in the DRG cell morphology, a fragmentation of the neuritic 
network  and  a  reduction  of  about  50%  of  the  neurite  extension  area.  Xaliproden  (3µM) 
preserved  the  cell  morphology  and  reduced  significantly  by  62%  the  neuritic  damage 
induced by oxaliplatin. In a similar experiment, without schwann cells, xaliproden reduced 
by  35%  the  toxic  effect  of  oxaliplatin  which  suggests  that  the  protective  activity  of 
xaliproden  is,  at  least  partly,  due  to  an  indirect  effect  on  schwann  cells.  Actually  while 
oxaliplatin  does  not  impair  the  survival  of  schwann  cells  it  decreases  dramatically  their 
ability of synthesis of laminin, a trophic factor involved in the differentiation and survival 
of neurons, by 72%. Xaliproden at 3µM was shown to reduce this toxic effect by 75%. 
 
More extensive data are presented in Section 4.2.

4.1.4 Summary of the results of the Xenox study 

 

The sample size of the current protocol was calculated based on the results of the XENOX 
trial. The main efficacy results are presented hereafter. 
This  multinational  randomized,  double  blind,  placebo  controlled  study  was  designed  to 
demonstrate the efficacy and safety of xaliproden in preventing Grade 3-4 PSN in patients 
with  1st  line  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  being  treated  with  the  FOLFOX4    regimen,  a 
combination of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² with 5-FU bolus/infusional and Leucovorin repeated 
every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the probability of first occurrence of Grade 3-4 
PSN relative to cumulative dose of oxaliplatin analyzed by Kaplan-Meier plot. In addition, 
the study was powered to demonstrate non-inferiority of the experimental arm vs control 
arm for response rate. 
The  dose  of  xaliproden  was  1mg  per  day  from  the  first  oxaliplatin  infusion  to  15  days 
following the last infusion of oxaliplatin.  
The  neurotoxicity  was  graded  using  the  specific  oxaliplatin  neurotoxicity  scale  for  dose 
adjustments and further evaluated with NCS. 
Six hundred and forty nine patients were randomized with 324 and 325 patients assigned 
in the placebo and xaliproden arm respectively.  
 
The  2  arms  were  well  balanced  for  demography  and  disease  characteristics.  Median 
exposure  to  chemotherapy  was  of  12  cycle  in  both  arms.  The  incidence  of  cumulative 
PSN, is presented in Table (4.1.4) 1.

4.2.2 Preclinical data 

Xaliproden  is  an  orally  active  non-peptide  neurotrophic  and  neuroprotective  agent.  The 
mechanism of action of xaliproden has not been fully elucidated but results from a variety 
of lesion models of central and peripheral nervous system disorders indicate its ability to 
minimize experimentally induced degeneration of neurons. These data along with results 
of  in  vitro  models  for  neurotrophic  effects  suggest  that  xaliproden  either  mimics  or 
enhances the effects of naturally-occurring protein neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF…)  which 
influence  the  development  and/or  repair  of  neurons.  Xaliproden  is  also  an  agonist  of  5-
HT1A  receptors. 
 
The  effect  of  xaliproden  on  sensorimotor  nerve  regeneration  was  evaluated  in  vivo  in 
acrylamide-induced  peripheral  neuropathy  in  rats  (20)  (21).  In  vehicle-treated  animals, 
acrylamide administration leads to neuronal lesions which develop after several weeks of 
treatment into a paralysis of the posterior limbs. Motor function recovers gradually after 
withdrawal  of  the  toxin,  but  recovery  is  not  complete  even  4 weeks  after  the  last 
acrylamide injection. In rats administered xaliproden (3 to 10 mg/kg p.o. daily), the first 
signs of motor deficits appeared later than in vehicle-treated animals, the evolution of the 
deficits  was  slower,  and  their  amplitude  less  important.  Motor  performance  was  also 
significantly  improved  during  the  recovery  period  in  rats  treated  with  xaliproden 
compared  to  that  in  vehicle-treated  animals.  When  xaliproden  was  first  administered  at 
later times during the acrylamide treatment (just before the start of the motor deficits; just 
after their onset; or at their peak occurrence), the compound was still able to reduce the 
motor deficits.

In vitro the neuroprotective properties of xaliproden were studied in co-cultures of dorsal 
root  ganglia  (DRG)  and  Schwann  cells,  in  which  neuritogenesis  was  reduced  by  the 
cytostatic  drugs  cisplatin,  vincristine,  taxol  and  oxaliplatin  (18)  (19).  It  was  found  that 
neurite  outgrowth  from  DRG  treated  with  cisplatin  (3 µg/ml)  and  10  µM  xaliproden  or 
oxaliplatin  5  µM  and  3  µM  xaliproden  for  3  days  was  significantly  higher  than  after 
treatment with either one of the two platinum-based drugs alone. Similarly, neuritogenesis 
from DRG treated with taxol (0.01 µg/ml) or vincristine (0.5 ng/ml) in combination with 
10  µM  xaliproden  was  significantly  increased  compared  to  treatment  with  taxol  or 
vincristine alone. 
 
In vitro, xaliproden (10µM) did not impact the antiproliferative activity of oxaliplatin on 
colon  carcinoma  cell  lines  COLO205,  LOVO  and  HCT116  (internal  documentation 
MTP1000).  
In vivo, xaliproden (1mg/kg/d) did not impact the antitumor efficacy of oxaliplatin (up to 
11.7 mg/kg/injection) in C51 bearing mice (internal documentation BCM-1488).  
Similarly  xaliproden  (up  to  10  mg/kg/day)  did  not  impact  the  antitumor  efficacy  of 
oxaliplatin  (up  to  10  mg/kg/injection)  combined  with  5-FU  (25  mg/kg/injection)  in 
HCT116 bearing scid mice (internal documentation MTP1001). 
 
Xaliproden (10 µM) did not impair in vitro the antiproliferative activity of taxol, cisplatin 
or oxaliplatin on the hormono-independent human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB/231. 
 
Xaliproden did not affect in vitro the growth or the proliferation of human leukemia cell 
lines  (internal  report  IVT007,  IVT008),  did  not  modify  the  blastic  transformation  of 
human  peripheral  blood  leukocytes  (internal  report  IVT0006)  and  did  not  induce  DNA 
synthesis in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells (internal report IVT0005). Furthermore, xaliproden 
(10 mg/kg/day p.o.)   did not affect the survival of mice inoculated i.p. with P388 murine 
leukemia cells (internal report IVV002). 
 
All these findings indicate that xaliproden could be useful for the prevention and recovery 
from  neuropathies  induced  by  oncolytic  agents  without  compromising  their  tumor 
cytotoxicity. 
 
4.2.3 Pharmacokinetic properties 

Xaliproden is well absorbed by the oral route, pharmacokinetics is linear at doses ranging 
from  0.5  to  2  mg  daily  and  food  does  not  significantly  modify  the  extent  of  absorption 
(Tmax delayed by 3 hours, from 2 to 5 hours).  
Xaliproden is widely distributed in the body (apparent distribution volume > 500 L) and is 
highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%), mainly albumin; no saturation at concentrations 
far above those achieved at the recommended dose (i.e. 1 mg daily) is observed. 
Xaliproden  is  primarily  metabolized  by  CYP2D6  .  Xaliproden  is  excreted  in  the  faeces 
and urine mainly as metabolites. 
 
In extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, the mean apparent plasma clearance is 2 L/h and the 
elimination  half-life  is  approximately  15  days.  Steady  state  plasma  concentrations  are 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

25/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 

generally obtained after 2 months and are approximately 5-fold higher than those observed 
after a single dose administration. 
In poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, steady state plasma concentrations are generally obtained 
after  6  months  and  are  approximately  2.4-fold  higher  than  those  observed  in  extensive 
metabolizers. 
When  co-administered  with  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitors  such  as  fluoxetine,  xaliproden 
plasma levels are in average 3.1-fold higher than those observed when administered alone. 
Since xaliproden is well tolerated in poor metabolizers, the increase in plasma levels due 
to  the  co-administration  with  CYP2D6-inhibitor  drugs  is  not  expected  to  have  clinical 
relevance.  
Based  on  in-vitro  data,  xaliproden  is  not  expected  to  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
drugs  primarily  metabolized  by  CYP1A2,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2E1  or  CYP3A4. 
Xaliproden  may  increase  plasma  levels  of  drugs  primarily  metabolized  by  CYD2D6. 
However, maximum therapeutic xaliproden concentrations expected after 1 or 2 mg dose 
(i.e. < 0.5 µg/ml) are 8-fold lower than the inhibitory constant. 
Since  oxaliplatin  does  not  significantly  inhibit  cytochrome  P450  activity  in  vitro, 
metabolically  mediated  drug-drug  interactions  of  oxaliplatin  and  xaliproden  are  not 
anticipated. 
An in vivo healthy volunteer study demonstrated that xaliproden administered for 7 days, 
did not affect prothrombin time or the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. 
 
4.2.4 Preclinical Safety Data (toxicology) 

Xaliproden showed no carcinogenetic potential. 
Xaliproden has no mutagenic or genotoxic activity. 
Reproductive  toxicity  in  rats  and  rabbits:  a  no-effect  level  could  not  be  established  for 
maternal  or  embryo-fetal  toxicity.  Studies  in  mice  and  rats  have  shown  that  xaliproden 
and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. 
 
 
The outstanding feature from the repeated-dose toxicity studies was the development of a 
time- and dose-dependent toxicity consisting mainly of multi-organ / system infiltration of  
characteristic  enlarged  macrophages  and  brain  lesions  associated  with  a  significant 
decrease in glucosylceramidase activity. Collectively, these changes resemble Gaucher’s 
disease,  a  lipid  storage  disease  described  in  humans  and  caused  by  deficiency  of 
glucosylceramidase.  In  animal  species,  no  NOEL  was  identified  for  the  development  of 
“Gaucher’s  like”  toxicity.  However,  it  was  demonstrated  that  this  toxicity  is  due  to  the 
inhibition  of  glucosylceramidase  activity  by  an  intermediate  metabolite  (SR122245-
epoxide), the formation rate of which varies according to species. Importantly, the rate of 
formation of SR122245 and of its further oxidation are both much slower in humans than 
in  rats  or  baboons,  suggesting  that  humans  are  less  susceptible  to  inhibition  of 
glucosylceramidase by xaliproden treatment than either rats and baboons. 
 
In Phase III ALS studies, patients treated with xaliproden (1 or 2 mg) for up to 18 months 
showed  no  evidence  of  lymphocyte  glucosylceramidase  inhibition  over  time  and  no 
difference in overall mean values for glucosylceramidase activity as compared to placebo 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

26/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 

treated patients (from approximately 100 patients per group at six months to 50 patients 
per group at 18 months). In patients with AD treated with xaliproden (0.5, 1, or 2 mg) for 
up  to  3  months,  no  difference  in  change  from  baseline  between  any  treatment  group  or 
placebo was observed, at any post-baseline visit (approximately 25-30 patients per group). 
Furthermore,  no  “Gaucher-like”  pathology  or  brain  lesions  similar  to  those  observed  in 
animal toxicity studies were observed in postmortem examinations from 41 patients who 
received xaliproden (0.5, 1 or 2 mg) and who died from their illness (23 patients treated 
for  over  1  year).  These  pathology  results  are  in  agreement  with  the  lack  of 
glucosylceramidase  inhibition  observed  in  patients  treated  with  xaliproden  and  with  the 
probable absence or low amount of the metabolite responsible for inhibition in animals. 
 
4.2.5 Clinical Safety Data 

Three ALS trials of 18 months duration, involving 1484 patients taking xaliproden 1 or 2 
mg  daily,  have  been  completed.  In  the  ALS  dossier,  1mg  daily  is  the  proposed 
recommended dose based on both efficacy and safety considerations. 
Adverse drug reactions of xaliproden were determined based on an excess incidence of ≥ 
2%  compared  to  placebo  in  the  pooled  data  from  the  3  clinical  trials  as  shown  in 
Table (4.2.5) 1.

An  analysis  of  the  time  to  onset  and  duration  of  xaliproden-related  AEs  has  shown  the 
following: 
 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

28/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

•  Dizziness, nausea and vomiting were observed very shortly after the initiation of treatment 

and lasted only 2 to 3 days. 

 
•  Tinnitus and paresthesias (i.e.: tingling sensation, formication) had a longer time to onset: 

about 3 weeks after treatment initiation, but also lasted only 2 to 3 days. 

 

 
•  Diarrhea median time to onset was within 2 to 3 months of xaliproden treatment and the 

median duration of episodes was again 2 to 3 days. 
 
Overall,  these  AEs  were  consistent  in  nature  with  the  serotoninergic  properties  of 
xaliproden, of short duration and had no impact on the continuation of treatment (they led 
to  treatment  discontinuation  for  0  to  0.4%  of  the  patients).  They  resolved  although 
xaliproden treatment continued, suggesting the development of a tolerance to these effects 
under treatment with xaliproden. 
 
Insomnia was observed after several weeks of xaliproden treatment and tended to continue 
throughout treatment leading to discontinuation in only 0.4% of patients in the 1 mg daily 
group, 0.3% each in the 2 mg and placebo groups, respectively. 
 

• 

•  Because  the  observed  incidence  of  hyperglycemia  (serotoninergic  property)  was  higher 
for patients treated with xaliproden (6.5% in the 1 mg group) than in the placebo group, 
the diabetogenic potential of xaliproden from the ALS trials pooled data was assessed: De 
novo  diabetes  incidence  was  similar  in  both  placebo  and  xaliproden  1  mg  groups,  no 
treatment discontinuation due to diabetes mellitus was reported in non-diabetic patients. 
Mean glucose levels and mean glycated hemoglobin levels changes between baseline and 
at 18 months on-study showed higher mean values in both xaliproden groups as compared 
with placebo. However, in diabetic patients treated with xaliproden, increases in glucose 
and  in  glycated  hemoglobin  levels  were  observed.  Therefore  a  monitoring  of  glucose 
levels in the present clinical trial is planned. Adjustment of the anti-diabetic treatment for 
diabetic patients under study, if hyperglycemia is reported, should be implemented. 
 

•  Oedema events under xaliproden (pooled oedema1:  19.7% of patients in the 1 mg group, 

20.1% in 2 mg group; 15.8% in placebo) were found not to be of cardiac origin. 
 

•  Also, not shown in the table, about 10% of patients in each of the 3 groups, experienced 

• 

allergy related AEs, such as eruption, enanthema, rashes, urticaria. 
 
In  the  3  ALS  trials,  no  consistent  differences  in  the  safety  profile  were  found  between 
poor and extensive metabolizers (28 patients in the 1 mg daily group and 24 patients in the 
2  mg  group),  although  higher  plasma  concentrations  of  xaliproden  were  found  in  poor 
metabolizers. Consistent with that finding, no pharmacokinetic (PK)  dependency of the 
safety profile was evidenced. Also, the effect of concomitant exposure to either CYP2D6 
inhibitor or substrate was analyzed in two ALS Phase III trials.

•  Although  unexpected,  a  lower  (and  not  higher)  incidence  of  insomnia  and  of  sensory 
disturbances  (e.g.  hyper/hypo/paresthesia,  neuralgia)  in  patients  treated  with  xaliproden 
was  observed  during  concomitant  administration  of  CYP2D6  inhibitor  or  substrate  as 
compared to placebo. 
 

•  There were no xaliproden - related modifications of liver function tests, renal function or 

hematological parameters. 
 

•  There was no evidence of either inhibition of glucosylceramidase activity or lesions such 

as those observed in animal toxicity studies (see Clinical Investigator Brochure).

6.  STUDY DESIGN 

6.1 Description of the Clinical Trial Protocol 

This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled, 2 arm Phase III study 
of  xaliproden  or  matching  placebo  (i.e.  study  drugs)  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin/5-
FU/LV  (modified  FOLFOX6)  in  patients  with  MCRC,  not  previously  treated  for 
metastatic disease, to evaluate the potential of xaliproden in preventing severe (Grade 3-4) 
cumulative  PSN.  In  addition,  the  ability  of  xaliproden  to  reduce  the  duration  of  PSN 
events that occur will be evaluated. At the same time, the absence of negative impact of 
xaliproden on chemotherapy efficacy will be evaluated. Randomization will be stratified 
for number of metastatic organs (1 and ≥2), prior adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin 
(yes, no) and treatment with bevacizumab (yes and no). 
 
Treatment with xaliproden, 1mg daily, or matching placebo will be initiated at the time of 
the  first  dosing  of  chemotherapy  and  will  continue  at  least  up  to  oxaliplatin 
discontinuation  (i.e.  15  days  following  the  last  infusion  of  oxaliplatin).  Patients  with 
persisting  PSN    (Grade>1)  at  the  time  of  oxaliplatin  discontinuation  will  continue  to  be 
treated with study drug, as initially randomized, until recovery and up to maximum of 3 
months. 
 
The primary endpoint is the reduction in the risk of occurrence of Grade 3-4 cumulative 
PSN relative to cumulative dose of oxaliplatin. 
The  neurological  evaluation  will  include  cumulative  PSN  grading  (Neurologic  Toxicity 
Scale for Oxaliplatin Dose Adjustments), and nerve conduction  studies (NCS). NCS will 
be done at baseline, at the end of treatment with oxaliplatin and at the end of treatment 
with  study  drug  (when  continued  after  oxaliplatin  discontinuation).  Response  rate  (main 
secondary  endpoint)  will  be  evaluated  using  RECIST  criteria  and  patients  will  be  also 
followed for progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival. 
 
The study is powered to demonstrate a 40% reduction in the risk of occurrence of Grade 3-
4 cumulative PSN. 
Overall 900 patients will be randomized. Accrual is planned to last 2 years. Sixty to 100 
investigational sites are anticipated to participate.

No interim analysis is planned. 
The study will be overseen by a Data Monitoring Committee. 
 
6.2 Duration of study participation 

 

Anti-cancer  therapy  will  consist  of  2-week  treatment  cycles.  Patients  should  be  treated 
with  anti-cancer  therapy  until  disease  progression  is  documented  or  until  unacceptable 
toxicity is reported. Patients will start with daily administration of study drug on the day 
of the first administration of oxaliplatin. Patients presenting with symptoms of cumulative 
PSN > Grade1 at the end of treatment with oxaliplatin will continue to receive study drug 
daily until recovery of PSN and up to maximum of 3 months and, during this period of the 
study, will be scheduled for monthly evaluation. Those with PSN ≤ Grade 1 at the time 
oxaliplatin  is  discontinued  will  stop  study  drug  15  days  after  the  last  administration  of 
oxaliplatin.  Patients  with  persisting  neuropathy  at  the  end  of  treatment  with  study  drug 
will  be  followed  for  PSN  resolution  every  2  months  in  the  absence  of  documented 
progression, every 3 months once progression is documented. 
 
Observation for Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) with exception of PSN will 
be performed for up to 30 days following the last dose of study drug.  
 
Patients with progressive disease (PD) at any point during the study will discontinue anti-
cancer  treatment  under  this  protocol.  Objective  evidence  of  PD  will  be  recorded  at  the 
time of progression.  Patients without evidence of progression, regardless of the number of 
treatment cycles received, will be followed for progression by CT  or MRI  scans every 2 
months  until  it  is  documented,  or  for  13  months  following  the  first  administration  of 
chemotherapy, whichever comes first.  
After PD has been documented, patients will be followed every 3 months for survival. 
 
6.3 Study committee 

A  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)    will  be  set  up  with  the  objective  to  review  trial 
enrollment,  compliance  to  protocol,  safety  of  the  administered  treatments  and  quality  of 
the  data.    The  DMC  will  consist  of  two  external  independent  physicians  not  associated 
with  the  conduct  of  the  study.    This  committee  will  convene  at  least  every  6  months  to 
review safety (toxicities -including peripheral neurotoxicity- treatment exposure, SAEs -
including the rate of deaths- up to 30 days following last administration of study drug) and 
other issues related to the appropriate conduct of the trial.  
 
DMC  procedures  will  be  detailed  in  the  DMC  charter  and  approved  by  the  DMC 
members.

8.1.1 Xaliproden and matching placebo 

In this protocol, xaliproden and matching placebo are referred as “study drug”. 
 
8.1.1.1 Name of the  investigational product 

 

Xaliproden (SR57746A) 
 
8.1.1.2 Pharmaceutical form  

1.0 mg capsule (Arm B) or matching placebo (Arm A) 
Excipient: maize starch, magnesium stearate, colloidal anhydrous silica, microcrystalline 
cellulose. 
 
8.1.1.3 Number of units per administration and timing of administration   

1 capsule once a day, at the end of the morning breakfast. 
Oral route, to be swallowed with a glass of water. 
 
8.1.1.4 Duration of treatment  

Study  drug  will  be  initiated  on  Day  1  of  the  first  cycle  of  chemotherapy  and  will  be 
administered daily while the patient is under treatment with oxaliplatin. If there are delays 
or reductions of the chemotherapy dose, the dose of study drug will not be adjusted. 
End  of  treatment  with  study  drug  will  depend  of  the  patients’  PSN  status  at  the  time 
oxaliplatin is discontinued: 
 
-Patients reporting PSN ≤ Grade 1 at this time point will discontinue study drug 15 days 
after the last administration of oxaliplatin. 
-Patients reporting PSN > Grade 1 at this time point will continue to be treated with study 
drug, as initially randomized, until resolution of symptoms of PSN, and up to a maximum 
of 3 months after the last administration of oxaliplatin. 
 
8.1.1.5 Description of the blinding methods 

Xaliproden and matching placebo will be supplied in identical capsule form. 
 
8.1.1.6 Method of assigning patients to treatment group 

This is a randomized study. 
In  order  to  balance  treatments  groups  with  regard  to  prognostic  factors  for  colorectal 
cancer,  randomization  will  be  stratified  by  using  a  centralized  randomization  service 
(Interactive  Voice  Randomization  System  (IVRS)),  taking  into  account  the  following 
factors: 
 

•  Number of metastatic organs involved (1 and ≥2) 
•  Oxaliplatin as part of adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, no) 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

35/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

•  Treatment with bevacizumab (yes and no) 

 

 
The site will call a dedicated phone number provided by the IVRS system after a patient is 
consented, screened, and determined to be eligible for study entry. The IVRS will allocate 
a  treatment  number  to  the  patient  in  accordance  with  the  randomization  schema.  The 
patient  will  be  considered  registered  into  the  trial  once  this  treatment  number  has  been 
assigned.  
 
The Operation Manual provides details for this procedure. 
 
8.1.1.7 Packaging and labeling  

Xaliproden and matching placebo will be packaged in wallets containing 36 capsules (a 
one month treatment supply). Each wallet will be labeled with the treatment number, the 
batch number and the expiry date. Each three month treatment box containing 3 wallets 
will  be  supplied  and  uniquely  labeled  with  a  number.  Every  3  month,  patients  will  be 
allocated with a new treatment box and a new treatment number. 
 
8.1.1.8 Storage condition 

Xaliproden may be stored between 15°C and 25°C away from extremes heat and humidity 
(excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C) 
 
8.1.1.9 Access to randomization code during the study 

In case of an Adverse Event, the code must be broken only in exceptional circumstances 
when  knowledge  of  the  study  drug  is  essential  for  treating  the  patient.  If  possible,  a 
contact should be initiated with the Monitoring Team before breaking the code. 
 
The IVRS center should be called if code-breaking is necessary. Only if this fails, code-
breaking material can be opened. 
 
For each patient, code-breaking material is supplied, containing the name of the treatment. 
Each treatment box will be labeled with a 3-panel label. The third panel, which is masked 
by  a  scratch  off  laminate,  contains  emergency  and  treatment  (xaliproden  or  placebo) 
information.  It  will  be  kept  in  a  safe  place  on  site  throughout  the  Clinical  Trial.  The 
Sponsor will retrieve all code-breaking material (opened or sealed) on completion of the 
Clinical Trial. 
 
For  each  patient,  code-breaking  material  is  also  kept  during  the  Clinical  Trial  by  the 
Sponsor. 
 
If the blind is broken, the Investigator will document the date, time of day, and reason for 
code breaking.

Reconstitution 
The  freeze-dried  powder  is  reconstituted  by  adding  20  mL  of  water  for  injection  or  5% 
dextrose  solution  and  then  by  diluting  in  an  infusion  solution  of  250-500 mL  of  5% 
dextrose solution. 
 
The  reconstitution  or  final  dilution  must  never  be  performed  with  a  sodium  chloride 
solution. 
 
Co-administration of leucovorin 
For simultaneous administration of oxaliplatin and leucovorin, separate infusion bags and 
lines must be used with Y-tubing connecting the 2 lines before the single injection site. 
 
Incompatibilities 
Do not combine with alkaline medications or media, which cause oxaliplatin to degrade.  
Do  not  administer  simultaneously  by  the  same  line.    Flush  line  after  oxaliplatin 
administration.   
 
Do not use preparation or administration needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum 
components.  There is a risk of degrading the oxaliplatin. 
 
8.1.2.2 5-FU and Leucovorin 

5-FU and Leucovorin calcium should be obtained from commercial sources 
 
Information concerning 5-FU and LV can be found in their respective package inserts. 
 
8.1.2.3 Chemotherapy administration 

Oxaliplatin / 5-FU/LV will be administered as modified FOLFOX6. 
 
This  regimen  is  a  variant  of  the  FOLFOX4  regimen  where  the  2nd  bolus  of  5-FU  is 
omitted. 
The dose of oxaliplatin use in the mFOLFOX6 regimen is the same as the dose used in 
FOLFOX4. The cycle schedule is the same, i.e. the chemotherapy is administered every 2 
weeks. 
 
Details are given below: 

Modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6): 
 
Day 1:  Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV infusion in 250-500 mL D5W and leucovorin 350 
mg/m² IV infusion both given over 120 minutes at the same time in bags using 
a  Y-line,  followed  by  5-FU  400  mg/m²  IV  bolus  given  over  2-4  minutes, 
followed by 5-FU continuous infusion Day 1 & Day 2.

8.1.3 Guidelines for Treatment Modifications 

Toxicity  will  be  graded  according  to  the  NCI-CTCAE,  version  3.0  (Appendix  B),  with 
exception of peripheral sensory neuropathy which will be graded according to the specific 
Neurologic Toxicity Scale for oxaliplatin Dose Adjustments Table (8.1.3.2.2) 3. 
 
Reason(s)  for  dose  modifications  or  delays,  the  supportive  measures  taken,  and  the 
outcome will be documented in medical record (patient’s chart) and recorded in the CRF. 
 
8.1.3.1 Study drug 

There is no dose adjustment for study drug. 
Study drug should be taken daily regardless of whether there is a chemotherapy delay or 
dose reduction.  
 
Concomitant  anti-diabetic  treatment  should  be  adjusted  if  hyperglycemia  occurs  and 
follow-up of glycemia implemented. 
 
8.1.3.2 Oxaliplatin + 5-FU+LV, mFOLFOX6 

8.1.3.2.1 Dosing delays 

Chemotherapy will be delayed until: 
 

•  Neutrophil count is ≥1.5 X 109/L and platelet count is ≥75 X 109/L  
•  Recovery from stomatitis or diarrhea to Grade 1 or less 
•  Recovery from skin toxicity to Grade 1 or less (see skin toxicity) 
•  Recovery from other toxicities to Grade 2 or less. 

 
If  toxicity  requires  chemotherapy  to  be  delayed  more  than  2  weeks  after  the  next 
scheduled cycle of chemotherapy during the first 6 months of treatment, the patient will be 
permanently discontinued. For patients who remain on treatment for more than 6 months 
and who experience toxicity requiring a single dosing delay of more than 4 consecutive 
weeks, a q3 week dosing schedule may be implemented. 
 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

39/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

If  5-FU/LV  treatment  is  delayed,  the  associated  oxaliplatin  dose  should  also  be  delayed 
and conversely. Patients who require discontinuation of oxaliplatin alone, may continue to 
receive 5-FU/LV if felt to be appropriate treatment for the patient by the investigator. 
 
For patients who have had dosing delays, all evaluations, including tumor evaluation, will 
be correspondingly delayed (with the exception of a confirming scan to be performed at 
least 4 weeks, but not more than 6 weeks, after the scan showing a response to treatment). 
 
8.1.3.2.2 Dose reductions, mFOLFOX6 

 

A dose adjustment at the beginning of a new cycle should be based upon the most severe 
toxicity encountered in the previous cycle. 
Doses that have been reduced may not be escalated. 
There is no dose reduction for LV regardless of changes in 5-FU and oxaliplatin doses. 
 
Table (8.1.3.2.2) 1 describes general dose reduction guidelines for each component of the 
mFOLFOX6 regimen.

c  May also be pre-treated with benzodiazapines 
 
The neurotoxicity includes paresthesias and dysesthesias of the hands, feet, and peri-oral 
region.    Patients  treated  with  oxaliplatin  in  this  study  will  be  counseled  to  avoid  cold 
drinks  and  exposure  to  cold  water  or  air,  especially  for  3-5  days  following  oxaliplatin 
administration. 
 
Laryngopharyngeal dysesthesias 
An  unusual  laryngopharyngeal  dysesthesia consisting  in  a  loss  of  sensation  of  breathing 
without  any  objective  evidence  of  respiratory  distress  (hypoxia,  laryngospasm,  or 
bronchospasm) has been reported. This neurotoxicity may be induced or exacerbated upon 
exposure to cold. 
 
Should  a  patient  develop  such  laryngopharyngeal  dysesthesia,  the  patient's  oxygen 
saturation  will  be  evaluated  via  a  pulse  oximeter  and,  if  normal,  an  anxiolytic  agent  or 
benzodiazepine  will  be  given  and  the  patient  should  be  observed  in  the  clinic  until  the 
episode has resolved.  The infusion may then be continued at 1/3 the rate.  Because this 
syndrome may be associated with the rapidity of oxaliplatin infusion, subsequent doses of 
oxaliplatin  should  be  administered  as  6-hour  infusions  (instead  of  the  normal  2-hour 
infusion).

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 

Oral cryotherapy 
 
Patients on oxaliplatin should not receive oral cryotherapy (such as ice chips) on Day 1 of 
each  cycle  as  this  may  exacerbate  oral  or  throat  dysesthesias,  and  laryngopharyngeal 
dysesthesia.   
 
Allergic Reactions 
 
For Grade 1 or 2 acute hypersensitivity reactions, no dose modification of oxaliplatin is 
required  if,  in  the  Investigator’s  opinion,  it  is  in  the  patient’s  best  interest  to  continue.  
Pre-medication  with  dexamethasone  20 mg  IV,  diphenhydramine  50 mg  IV,  and  one  of 
the  following:    cimetidine  300 mg  IV,  ranitidine  50 mg  IV,  or  famotidine  20  mg  IV 
30 minutes  prior  to  study  drug  administration  is  recommended.    If  an  allergic  reaction 
persists  into  the  next  cycle,  administer  50  mg  dexamethasone  PO  12 hours  and  6  hours 
prior to administration of oxaliplatin.   
 
For Grade 3 or 4 acute hypersensitivity reactions, oxaliplatin should be discontinued. 
 
Pulmonary fibrosis 
 
In the case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as nonproductive cough, dyspnea, 
crackles  or  radiological  pulmonary  infiltrates,  oxaliplatin  should  be  discontinued  until 
further investigations exclude interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. 
 
Hepatic toxicity 
In case of abnormal liver function test results or occurrence of portal hypertension which 
cannot be explained by liver metastases, hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, 
and if appropriate should be investigated. When veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver 
is  suspected  oxaliplatin  should  be  discontinued  until  further  investigations  exclude  this 
diagnosis. 
 
8.1.4 Responsibilities 

The  Investigator,  the  Hospital  Pharmacist,  or  other  personnel  allowed  to  store  and

•  Patients  who  require  discontinuation  of  bevacizumab  for  bevacizumab  related 

toxicity will continue to be treated with oxaliplatin and 5-FU/LV, as indicated. 

•  Patients who require discontinuation of oxaliplatin alone, may continue to receive 
5-FU/LV  and  bevacizumab  if  felt  appropriate  treatment  for  the  patient  by  the 
investigator. 

•  Bevacizumab should be obtained from commercial sources 

 
8.2.2.2 Supportive therapies 

The choice of pre- and post-treatment anti-emetics and the details of their administration 
are  at  the  discretion  of  the  Investigator.  5HT3  antagonists  plus  dexamethasone,  if  not 
contraindicated, are strongly recommended for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. 
 
The  package  inserts  provide  further  information  regarding  the  administration  of  anti-
emetics (e.g. ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron and dexamethasone). 
 
Patients  should  receive  full  supportive  care  including,  anti-diarrheics,  antibiotics, 
analgesics  and  transfusion  of  blood  products,  when  appropriate,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
investigator.  
 
Hematopoeitic  growth  factors  used  in  patients  experiencing  recurrent  difficulties  with 
neutropenia in subsequent cycles or in patients with serious neutropenic complications are 
permitted. 
 
Patients  must  be  supplied  with  a  medical  contact  who  is  available  24  hours  daily  and 
should be instructed when to call in case of adverse experiences. 

 

 

9.  ASSESSMENT OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 

9.1 Efficacy 

9.1.1 Neurological evaluation 

Cumulative  PSN  will  be  assessed  by  the  investigator  using  the  severity  grading  of  the 
specific Neurologic Toxicity Scale for Oxaliplatin Dose Adjustments (Table (8.1.3.2.2) 3).  
 
This assessment will be done: 

•  At baseline 
•  Prior to each chemotherapy infusion  (i.e. every 2 weeks), 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

45/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 

 

•  Then  monthly  for  the  patients  continuing  study  drug  beyond  oxaliplatin 
discontinuation  (i.e.  patients  with  PSN  Grade  >  1  at  the  time  oxaliplatin  is 
permanently discontinued). 

•  At the 30-day Follow-up visit, following the last administration of study drug, 
•  Every 2 or 3 months for the patients with persisting symptoms of PSN after the 30-
day  Follow-up  visit  in  order  to  assess  recovery  (every  2  months  when  disease 
progression  is  not  yet  documented,  every  3  months  after  disease    progression  is 
documented). 

In addition, NCS will be performed by a neurologist, at baseline (prior to randomization), 
at the end of treatment with oxaliplatin, and for those patients continuing treatment with 
study  drug  due  to  a  persisting  PSN>  Grade  1  after  discontinuation  of  oxaliplatin,  at  the 
end of the treatment with study drug. 
The baseline evaluation should be done within 14 days prior to randomization. The second 
evaluation will be performed after the termination of treatment with oxaliplatin, i.e.:  at the 
first  “monthly  visit”  for  the  patients  continuing  treatment  with  study  drug  beyond 
oxaliplatin discontinuation or at 30-day Follow-up visit for those discontinuing study drug 
at  the  time  of  oxaliplatin  discontinuation.  In  this  later  case  the  evaluation  at  the  end  of 
oxaliplatin treatment and the one at the end of study drug treatment will coincide. A third 
evaluation  will  occur,  for  those  patients  continuing  study  drug  past  end  of  oxaliplatin 
treatment, at the eventual end of study drug dosing D30. Overall patients will have 2 to 3 
NCS depending on the duration of treatment with study drug. 
 
The NCS will be evaluated as secondary endpoint. 
 
Motor  conduction  studies  will  include  conduction  velocity,  compound  muscle  action 
potential  (CMAP) and distal latency of the peroneal nerve, on both sides, as measured by 
standard methods.  
Sural  nerve  conduction  velocity  and  sensory  action  potential  (SAP)  will  be  recorded 
antidromically  by  surface  electrodes  on  each  side.  When  SAPs  are  not  detectable  by 
surface electrodes, the near-nerve needle method will be used.  
 
For each nerve, lack of response deemed by the neurologist to be absent due to technical 
reasons will be recorded as missing data. Lack of response deemed by the neurologist to 
be due to nerve pathology will be recorded as absent (zero amplitude). 
 
The  same  technique  must  be  used  by  the  same  neurologist  at  inclusion  and  at  each 
evaluation. NCS records should be carefully kept at study site. 
 
Neurological assessments are summarized in Table (9.1.1) 1 and in Figure (9.1.1) 1.

9.1.2 Antitumor Efficacy 

 

Evaluation of antitumoral efficacy includes RR (main secondary endpoint), PFS and OS. 
 
Tumor assessments will be performed until disease progression is documented or for 13 
months after the first administration of chemotherapy, whichever comes first, regardless of 
when chemotherapy was discontinued. 
Tumoral assessment will be done using RECIST criteria.  
 
The  same  imaging  techniques  should  be  used  from  baseline  to  disease  progression  to 
maintain  consistency.  If  contrast  agent  is  used  at  baseline,  it  must  be  used  for  all 
subsequent evaluations. Ultrasound is not permitted for evaluation of tumor response. 
 
Baseline  imaging  evaluations  are  to  be  performed  within  28  days  of  the  first  planned 
chemotherapy administration. Tumoral assessments will then be performed every 4 cycles 
/ 2 months. 
 
After a tumor evaluation is performed which demonstrates a tumor response, confirmation 
of the response will be obtained by a second imaging study. The confirmation scans are to 
be performed not less than 4 weeks but not more than 6 weeks after the first evidence of 
response is obtained in order for a response to be scored as Complete Response (CR) or 
Partial Response (PR) 
 
Once  progression  is  documented  patients  will  be  followed  once  every  3  months  for 
survival until death. 
 
Details for tumoral assessments: 
 
At all time points tumor evaluations must consist of a CT or MRI scan. 
 
At baseline, a CT or MRI scan of the abdomen, chest or other relevant organ system with 
target lesion(s) is required. 
 
For patients with target lesions located in the liver, a CT or MRI scan of the abdomen is 
required.    A  chest  X-ray  is  also  required  at  each  tumor  evaluation  to  follow  non-target 
lesions or the appearance of new lesions in the lung. 
 
For patients with target lesions located in the lung, a CT or MRI of the chest is required. 
In order to follow non-target lesions or the appearance of new lesions in the liver and/or in 
the pelvis, the CT or MRI images must also include the liver, and / or the pelvis. 
 
For patients with target lesions located in the pelvis, a CT or MRI of the pelvis is required.  
In order to follow non-target lesions or the appearance of new lesions in the liver or lung, 
a CT or MRI of the abdomen and a chest X-ray is required.  
 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

48/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 

At baseline, up to a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ and 10 target lesions in total 
will be identified and followed throughout the study. At least one target lesion is required 
for inclusion in this protocol. Target lesion(s) must be unidimensionally measurable with a 
diameter of at least ≥20 mm using conventional CT or MRI or ≥10 mm using spiral CT. 
 
Disease  response  for  target  lesion(s)  will  be  determined  by  either  a  CR  defined  as  the 
disappearance of all lesions or a PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest 
diameter.  Disease progression will be determined by at least a 20% increase in the sum of 
the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest 
diameter since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  Stable 
disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum 
of  the  longest  diameter  since  treatment  started.  Tumor  evaluation  criteria  by  which  the 
Investigator will judge disease response or progression in patients with target lesions are 
summarized in Table (9.1.2) 1.

•  Multiple  lesions:    the  sum  of  the  longest  diameters  of 

target lesions identified at baseline.  

To  determine  the  effect  of  therapy  2  observations  not  less 
than 4 weeks apart should be carried out. 

Progressive Disease (PD)  An increase by at least 20% in:

diameter recorded during treatment. 

•  Multiple  lesions:    an  increase  in  the  sum  of  the  longest 
diameter  of  target  lesions  compared  to  the  smallest 
diameter recorded during treatment.   

In addition, the appearance of any new lesions is considered 
PD. 
Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to  qualify  for  partial  response 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression can 
be  established,  taking  as  reference  the  smallest  sum  of  the 
longest  diameter  since  treatment  started.    In  addition,  no 
appearance of new lesions. 

 
At the end of the study, the best overall response achieved by each patient during the 
study will be scored.  The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start 
of  treatment  until  disease  progression/recurrence  (taking  as  reference  for  progressive 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

49/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the 
patient’s  best  response  assignment  will  depend  on  the  achievement  measurements  and 
confirmation criteria for both target and non-target lesions.  For the best overall response 
to  be  scored  as  a  CR  or  PR,  the  initial  response  must be confirmed  by  a  repeat  CT  or 
MRI scan performed within 4-6 weeks.  The date of progression is defined as the date of 
first  evidence  of  disease  progression  documented  by  an  imaging  study,  not  the 
confirmation  of  this  evaluation  obtained  subsequently.  Table (9.1.2) 2  provides  overall 
responses for all possible combinations of tumor responses in target lesion and non-target 
lesions.

Hepatomegaly alone is not sufficient to assess response or progression.  In the presence of 
evidence  suggestive  of  progression,  such  as  rising  CEA,  increasing  liver  enzymes, 
declining  performance  status,  weight  loss  or  increasing  pain,  every  reasonable  effort 
should  be  made  to  document  the  nature  of  progressive  disease  by  appropriate  imaging 
studies.  The  investigator  may  remove  a  patient  from  the  study  either  for  clinical 
progression when it is not possible to obtain an imaging study or for any other reason it is 
determined that it is in the best interest of the patient to do so; however, the rationale for 
this decision must be recorded in the patient’s medical chart and in the CRF. 
 
Clear  evidence  of  response/progression  must  be  documented  in  the  patient’s  medical 
record and this data will be recorded on the patient’s Case Report Form (CRF). 
 
For each individual patient, the same method of measurement/technique must be used for 
tumor evaluation throughout the study:  chest X-ray, CT scans, or MRI scans.  If a contrast 
agent  is  used  at  baseline,  it  must  be  used  for  all  subsequent  scans.    Ultrasound  is  not 
permitted for evaluation of tumor response. 
 
Tumor evaluations will not be performed after progression is documented.

10. PATIENT SAFETY 

10.1 Safety endpoints assessed in the trial and safety instruction specific to the study 

 

All patients will be followed at each visit for safety up to 30 days following study drug 
discontinuation (with exception of patients reporting persisting PSN at this time point). 
Safety  evaluation  will  include  AE/SAEs,  biochemistry,  and  haematologic  evaluations. 
Schedule and kind of laboratory tests to be performed at each time point are described in 
Section 12. 
The severity of AEs will be determined using the NCI CTCAE v.3.0 scale (Appendix B) 
Conditions  for  chemotherapy  dose  adjustments  /  discontinuation  in  relation  to  AEs  are 
described in Section 8. 
Evaluation of PSN is described in the efficacy section (Section 9.1.1). 
Please  note  that  patients  reporting  PSN  (any  grade)  at  the  30-day  Follow-up  visit  will 
continue to be followed for recovery. The timing for the follow up evaluations will depend 
on  patient  tumoral  status:  patient’s  PSN  status  will  be  recorded  once  every  2  months  in 
case  disease  progression  is  not  yet  documented  or/then  once  every  3  months  after 
progression is documented, along with follow up for survival. 
 
10.2 Adverse Events monitoring 

All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations and 
included in the final study report. 
 
Definitions: 
 
An  Adverse  Event  is  any  untoward  medical  occurrence  in  a  patient  or  clinical 
investigation  patient  administered  a  pharmaceutical  product  and  which  does  not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 

•  Results in death or; 
• 
Is life-threatening or; 

 

Note: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe. 

 
•  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or; 
•  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or; 
• 
• 

Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
Is a medically important event: 
Medical  and  scientific  judgment  should  be  exercised  in  deciding  whether 
expedited  reporting  is  appropriate  in  other  situations,  such  as  important  medical 
events  that  may  not  be  immediately  life-threatening  or  result  in  death  or 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

51/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

hospitalization  but  may  jeopardize  the  patient  or  may  require  intervention  to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
These should also usually be considered serious. 

 

 

Note: Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions or asymptomatic ALT increase * 10 ULN that does 
not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 

 
10.3 Obligation of the Investigator regarding safety reporting 

Adverse Events 
All  Adverse  Events  regardless  of  seriousness  or  relationship  to  Investigational  Product, 
spanning  from  the  first  visit  planned  in  the  Clinical  Trial  Protocol/signature  of  the 
informed consent form (ie, occurring during the washout period), up to day-30 Follow up 
visit, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) included in the Case Report Form. 
Whenever possible, symptoms should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis. The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity according to NCI CTCAE v.3 scale, 
action taken with respect to study drug and/or chemotherapy, corrective treatment/therapy 
given, outcome and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the 
Adverse Event was caused by the study drug and/or chemotherapy.  
 
Laboratory, vital signs or ECG  abnormalities are to be recorded as Adverse Events only if 
they  are  medically  relevant:  symptomatic,  requiring  corrective  treatment,  leading  to 
discontinuation and/or fulfilling a seriousness criterion. 
 
Serious Adverse Events 
In the case of a Serious Adverse Event the Investigator must immediately: 
 

•  SEND  (within  1  working  day,  preferably  by  fax)  the  signed  and  dated  corresponding 
page(s)  in  the  Case  Report  Form  to  the  representative  of  the  Monitoring  Team  whose 
name, address and fax number appear on the Clinical Trial Protocol; 
 

•  ATTACH  the  photocopy  of  all  examinations  carried  out  and  the  dates  on  which  these 
examinations  were  performed.  Care  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  Patient's  identify  is 
protected and Patient's identifiers in the Clinical Trial are properly mentioned on any copy 
of source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory 
normal ranges; 
 

•  Follow-up  of  any  Serious  Adverse  Event  that  is  fatal  or  life  threatening  should  be 
provided within one additional calendar week. The treatment code will be unblinded for 
reporting  of  Serious  Adverse  Event  that  are  unexpected  and  reasonably  associated  with 
the use of the study treatment. 

 
•  The  expectedness  evaluation  is  based  on  the  in  force  Clinical  Investigator  Brochure 
(Xaliproden) and officially approved labeling information of concomitant therapy(ies) at 
the time of event occurrence

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 

Follow-up 
 

 

• 

• 

•  The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, 
notably he should follow up the outcome of any Adverse Events (clinical signs, laboratory 
values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or consolidation of patient conditions; 
In the case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient must be followed up until clinical 
recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression 
has been stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the patient has left 
the Study and that additional investigations may be requested by the Monitoring Team; 
In case of any Serious Adverse Event brought to the attention of the Investigator at any 
time after cessation of Investigational Product and considered by him/her to be caused by 
the study treatment with a reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the Monitoring 
Team.

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 
Withdrawal from study drug 
Patients will be withdrawn from study drug for the following medical and/or administrative 
reasons: 
 

•  Poor compliance with the protocol 
•  Completed treatment with study drug, 
•  Adverse  event  (including  death),  treatment-limiting  toxicity,  intercurrent  medical 

problem, 

•  Voluntary withdrawal, investigator's decision. 
•  Subject lost to follow-up 
•  Other reason 
 
Withdrawal from trial 
Post-study treatment follow-up will continue, as described in Section 6.2. 

 

 

Patients will be withdrawn from the trial for the following medical and/or administrative 
reasons: 
•  Death 
•  Voluntary withdrawal 
•  Subject lost to follow-up 
•  Other reason 
•  Final cut-off / sponsor decision 
 
When  a  patient  withdraws  the  trial,  the  reason  of  withdrawal  will  be  documented  in  the 
medical chart and recorded on the CRF. An attempt to obtain all end of study evaluations 
is expected. All data collected for the entire course of the study must be recorded on CRF's 
and provided to the Sponsor. 
 
11.2 Reasons for withdrawal 

The patients may withdraw from the trial or from treatment at any time if they decide to do 
so, regardless of the reason. 
Patients  may  also  be  removed  from  the  trial  or  from  treatment  at  the  discretion  of  the 
investigator. 
 
11.3 Withdrawal follow-up procedure 

•  All withdrawals information should be documented in the medical chart and recorded on 

the appropriate page of the CRF.  

•  The CRF is to be completed up to the last visit performed for the patients considered lost 
to follow up. The investigator should make several attempts to re-contact the patient, and 
document these phone contacts/visits in the medical chart. Every attempt should be made 
to obtain the patient’s health status and the reason for withdrawal from the trial.

11.4 Consequence 

Patients  who  have  been  withdrawn  from  the  Study  cannot  be  re-included  in  the  Study. 
Their inclusion and treatment number must not be reused. 
 

 

12. STUDY PROCEDURES 

12.1 Baseline evaluations 

Assessments to be carried out prior to randomization are summarized in Table (12.1) 1. 
 
An  interview  will  take  place  involving  the  patient  and  the  investigator  to  determine 
whether or not the patient is eligible to enter the study. It is possible to make use of the 
assessments already performed as a routine procedure within 28 days before registration. 
If it is determined that the patient is a candidate for the study, the patient (or his or her 
legally  authorized  representative)  and  the  Investigator  will  sign  the  informed  consent 
form. The informed consent must to be obtained before any further assessment in order to 
complete the whole clinical study baseline assessments as required per protocol. 
 
If  female,  the  patient  must  not  be  pregnant  or  lactating.    Documentation  of  a  negative 
serum  HCG  pregnancy  test  for  women  of  childbearing  potential  is  required  prior  to 
randomization.    Men  and  women  who  are  fertile  must  use  a  medically  acceptable 
contraceptive  method  throughout  the  treatment  period  and  for  6  months  following 
cessation of treatment with oxaliplatin.  Patients must be made aware, before entering this 
trial, of the risk in becoming pregnant or in fathering children. 
 

•  Neurological baseline evaluation includes: 

 
Nerve Conduction Studies to be performed within 14 days before the first study treatment 
administration. 
Peroneal  nerve  motor  conduction  velocity  on  both  sides  and  compound  muscle  action 
potential (CMAP) and distal latency will be measured by standards methods. 
Sural  nerve  conduction  velocity  and  sensory  action  potential  (SAP)  will  be  recorded 
antidromically  by  surface  electrodes  on  both  sides.  When  SAPs  are  not  detectable  by 
surface electrodes, the near-nerve needle method will be used. 
The skin temperature must be controlled at greater than 32 degrees Celcius at the time of 
recording. 
 
The  patient’s  neurosensory    status  using  the  Neurologic  Toxicity  Scale  for  Oxaliplatin 
Dose Adjustments to be obtained, within 7 days of first administration of study drug. 
 

•  The  Investigator  will  evaluate  the  results  of  the  clinical  and  laboratory  assessments  as 

shown in Table (12.1) 1.

aTo  ensure  comparability,  the  baseline  imaging  and  subsequent  imaging  to  assess  response  must  be  performed  using 
identical techniques (i.e., scans performed immediately following bolus contrast administration using a standard volume 
of contrast, the identical contrast agent, and preferably the same scanner). 
 
If the patient’s characteristics comply with all the clinical and laboratory criteria necessary 
for registration, the patient may be randomized and he or she will be allocated a patient 
number according to randomization. 
 
A patient who has not been registered before the first administration will not be accepted 
for the study at a later date. 
 
12.2 Evaluation during the treatment period 

The study treatment period begins on the day of randomization. Chemotherapy is planned 
to be administered up to disease progression. Treatment with study drug will be initiated 
just before the first administration of the chemotherapy. Discontinuation of treatment with 
study  drug  will  depend  on  the  PSN  status  of  the  patient  at  the  time  oxaliplatin  is 
discontinued.

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

At the time oxaliplatin is discontinued: 

•  Should  the  patient  report  PSN  >  Grade  1,  she,  he  will  continue  treatment  with 

study drug up to the resolution of PSN and for a maximum of 3 months. 

•  Should the patient report PSN ≤ Grade 1, she, he will discontinue study drug 15 

days after the last administration of oxaliplatin. 

 

Thirty  days  after  study  drug  is  discontinued,  the  patients  will  performed  the  30-day 
Follow-up visit. 
 
12.2.1 Before each cycle (every 2 weeks) of chemotherapy with oxaliplatin 

Before the start of each chemotherapy cycle the investigator will evaluate the results of the 
clinical  and  laboratory  assessments  listed  in  Table (12.2.1) 1.  This  is  to  be  performed 
within 72 hours prior to the start of the next chemotherapy administration:

12.5 Definition of source data 

 

Source  Data:  All  information  of  clinical  findings,  observations,  or  other  activities  in  a 
clinical  trial  necessary  for  the  reconstruction  of  data  sources  and  evaluation  of  the  trial. 
Source  data  are  contained  in  source  documents  (original  records  or  certified  copies). 
Parameters  which  are  specifically  collected  for  the  study  in  the  CRF  and  which  are  not 
part of the patient’s medical file will be considered as source data. 
 
Source Documents: Original documents, data, and records (e.g. hospital records, clinical 
and  office  charts,  laboratory  notes,  memoranda,  records,  recorded  data  from  automated 
instruments,  copies  or  transcriptions  certified  after  verification  as  being  accurate  copies, 
microfiches,  photographic  negatives,  microfilm  or  magnetic  media,  x-rays,  subject  files, 
and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico-technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial). 
 
The patient must have consented to allow their medical records to be viewed by sponsor-
authorized  personnel  and  by  local  and  possibly  foreign  regulatory  authorities.  This 
information is included in the informed consent. Any effort should be done to keep in the 
hospital records the radiographic images and the NCS records performed during the study. 
 

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

13.1 Statistical and analytical plans 

This  section  is  the  basis  for  the  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  of  the  study.  The  plan  may  be 
revised during the study to accommodate Clinical Trial Amendments and to make changes 
to  adapt  to  unexpected  issues  in  study  execution  and  data  that  affect  planned  analyses. 
These revisions will be based on data blinded review, and a final plan will be issued prior 
to release of randomization code. 
 
13.2 Determination of sample size 

The primary endpoint of the study is the reduction of occurrence of Grade 3-4 PSN as a 
function of cumulative dose of oxaliplatin (Kaplan-Meier method).  
 
The sample size has been calculated using the following assumptions:

13.3 Study patient description 

13.3.1 Disposition of patients 

 

A patient will be considered as randomized if a treatment kit was assigned by the IVRS. 
All randomized patients will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The ITT 
population will be used for the primary efficacy analysis. 
 
A  Per  Protocol  population  (PP)  will  be  defined  for  the  Response  Rate  non-inferiority 
analysis.  The  PP  population  will  include  all  ITT  and  treated  patients  without  major 
protocol deviation (see Section 13.3.2) and evaluable for response (patients with at least 
one tumoral evaluation while on treatment, except for early progressors).  
The  Response  Rate  non-inferiority  analysis  will  be  performed  both  on  the  ITT  and  PP 
populations  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  stated  in  the  Committee  on 
Proprietary Medical Products Points-to-Consider, (22) and in the paper by D’Agostino and 
al. on the design concepts and issues of non-inferiority trials (23). 
 
The safety population will consist of all randomized patients receiving at least one dose of 
the study drug. 
 
In case the randomized treatment differs from the actual treatment received, the following 
rules will be applied: 

•  Efficacy analysis based on the ITT population will be carried out according to the 

randomized treatment. 

•  Secondary efficacy analysis based on the PP population and safety analysis will be 

carried out according to the actual treatment received. 

 
Numbers and percents of patients randomized, treated (safety), ITT and Per Protocol will 
be summarized by treatment arm. Reasons for stopping treatments will be also described. 
 
13.3.2 Clinical Trial Protocol deviations 

The  data  for  each  patient  will  be  screened  to  identify  entry  criteria  violations 
(inclusion/exclusion criteria) and other protocol deviations on study. Protocol deviations 
will be listed and classified into minor/major deviations during a blind review before the 
database lock. 
 
In particular, patients with the following major deviations will be excluded from the per 
protocol population:   

• No confirmed colorectal cancer (histology), 
• Non metastatic colorectal cancer, 
• No measurable lesion at baseline as defined by the RECIST criteria (i.e. no lesion with 
a diameter ≥ 20 mm using conventional CT or MRI scans or ≥ 10 mm using spiral 
CT scan), 

• Initiation of the study treatment within 6 months following the completion of the prior 

adjuvant therapy,

13.4 Data analysis considerations 

13.4.1 Dataset analyzed 

 

Study populations are defined in section 13.3.1 (Disposition of patients). 
 
13.4.2 General rules for handling of missing, unused or inconsistent data 

Censoring  mechanism  for  PSN  primary  analysis  and  for  time-related  parameters 
(Progression Free Survival, Overall Survival) is presented in Section 13.7. 
 
13.5 Demographic and baseline characteristics  

Demographic  and  disease  characteristics  will  be  analyzed  using  the  ITT  population. 
Analyses for the safety or the PP population may be presented if the number of patients 
differs substantially from the ITT population. 
 
13.5.1 Patient demographic characteristics, medical history and diagnoses 

Patient  demographic  characteristics  (gender,  age,  race,  weight,  height,  BSA,  WHO 
performance  status),  disease  characteristics  (diagnosis  information  and  baseline  disease 
characteristics), prior anti-cancer treatment for colorectal carcinoma and past medical or 
surgical history will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
 
13.5.2 Previous medications 

Previous/concomitant medications will be classified into anatomic and therapeutic classes 
using the WHO-DRL dictionary. For each medication, a selected ATC is chosen according 
to the dictionary. Previous medications will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
 
13.5.3 Baseline efficacy/activity data 

The baseline is defined as the last evaluation performed before the first study drug intake, 
unless otherwise specified.  
 
However, for calculation of time-to-event parameters (PFS, OS), the reference day will be 
the day of randomization.  
 
13.5.4 Baseline safety parameters 

For safety parameters, the baseline value is defined as the last available value prior to the 
first intake of the study drug. 
 
Signs and symptoms at baseline (including PSN) and ECG at baseline will be summarized 
by treatment group (only measured at baseline).

13.6 Investigational Product and concomitant therapy  

13.6.1 Investigational Product 

 

13.6.1.1 Extent of exposure 

Study drug 
Patient  exposure  to  the  study  drug  will  be  summarized  descriptively  using  duration  of 
dosing (weeks) and total dose administered (mg). 
 
Chemotherapy 
Exposure to the chemotherapy regimen will be summarized for each treatment group: total 
number  of  cycles  received,  duration  of  dosing  (weeks),  cumulative  dose  (mg/m²),  dose 
intensity and relative dose intensity (%). 
Dose delays and dose reductions will be also summarized by cycle and by patient. 
 
13.6.1.2 Measurement of treatment compliance 

Compliance (%) to the study drug will be summarized by treatment group. It is defined as 
percent of actual drug taken compared to the scheduled amount that was to be taken.  It is 
calculated according to the following formula: 
 

100 *  total capsules taken / [Nominal capsules per day *duration of exposure] 

 
13.6.2 Concomitant medication/therapy 

Concomitant medications, defined as those taken during double-blind study treatment, will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
 
13.7 Efficacy/activity analysis 

Efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population. The response rate will be 
primarily analyzed using the PP population (non-inferiority analysis). 
 
13.7.1 Primary efficacy variable(s) 

The  primary  objective  of  the  study  is  to  compare  the  risk  of  occurrence  of  Grade  3-4  
peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (PSN)  relative  to  cumulative  dose  of  oxaliplatin  between 
the 2 treatments arms. 
 
For the primary analysis, the occurrence of Grade 3-4 PSN will be studied according to the 
oxaliplatin cumulative dose (mg/m²) administered. Oxaliplatin cumulative dose to onset is 
defined as the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin (mg/m²) administered prior to and including 
the cycle at which Grade 3-4 PSN was first recorded.  

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

64/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 
If no Grade 3-4 cumulative PSN for a particular patient occurs before the end of treatment 
with study drug (30-day Follow-up visit), this patient will be considered censored at the 
total oxaliplatin cumulative dose administered. Patients not exposed to oxaliplatin will be 
considered censored at a cumulative dose of 0 mg/m². 
 
13.7.1.1 Description of the primary variable(s) 

 

13.7.1.2 Primary analysis 

The occurrence of Grade 3-4 PSN as regards to the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin will be 
estimated  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  and  compared  between  the  two  treatments 
groups using a 2-sided log rank test using a type I error of 0.05. 
 
Kaplan Meier curves for each of the two treatment arms will be constructed displaying the 
probability  of  first  experiencing  Grade  3-4  PSN.  The  x-axis  will  be  the  cumulative 
oxaliplatin dose (mg/m²). 
 
13.7.1.2.1 Handling of dropouts or missing data 

See Section 13.7.1 for definition of censoring rules. 
 
13.7.1.2.2 Multiple comparisons/multiplicity 

Not applicable. 
 
13.7.1.2.3 Other analyses for primary variable(s) 

Cox  proportional  hazard  modeling  should  be  used  to  examine  the  effect  of  center  and 
various prognostic factors on the occurrence of Grade 3-4 PSN.  
 
13.7.2 Secondary/other efficacy variables 

13.7.2.1 Description of secondary variables 

•  Main secondary endpoint: Response Rate 

 
RR  will  be  compared  between  the  control  and  the  experimental  arms  in  order  to  assure 
that the efficacy of the chemotherapy is not compromised by the addition of study drug to 
the chemotherapy regimen. 
 

•  Other secondary endpoints: 

 

o Secondary neuroprotection parameter:  

•  Overall incidence of PSN by patient (Grades 1, 2, 3-4,) 
•  Dose to onset of PSN (Grades 1, 2, 3-4) 
•  Duration of PSN (Grades 2, 3-4)

•  Treatment discontinuation, dose-reduction and dose-delay due to PSN. 
•  Treatment discontinuation, dose-reduction and dose-delay due to PSN. 
•  NCS 

o  Chemotherapy efficacy (Time-related parameters):  
 

Overall  survival  (OS)  is  defined  as  the  number  of  months  from  the  date  of 
randomization to the date of death. If death is not observed, data on OS will be 
censored at the  last date patient is known to be alive. 
 
Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the number of months from the date 
of randomization to the date of first observation of progression or death (from any 
cause). If death or progression is not observed, data on PFS will be censored at the 
date  of  last  tumor  assessment  without  evidence  of  progression.  In  a  second 
analysis, PFS will be censored at the earlier of the date of initiation of a new anti-
cancer therapy (if any) and the date of last tumor assessment without evidence of 
progression.

13.8 Safety analysis 

 

13.8.1 Adverse Events 

13.8.1.1 Definitions 

Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 3.0 scale. PSN will 
be graded according to the Neurologic Toxicity Scale for Oxaliplatin (Table (8.1.3.2.2) 3). 
 
Each  adverse  event  will  be  coded  to  a  “preferred  term”  and  associated  “system-organ 
class”  according  to  the  MedDRA  dictionary  before  the  treatment  code  is  broken.  The 
adverse event endpoints are number of patients experiencing: 
•  At least one event, 
•  An event under each recorded system-organ class, 
•  An event under each recorded preferred term. 
 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are AEs that occurred or worsened (if present 
before first study drug administration) during the double-blind treatment period up to 30 
days after the last dose of study drug.  
 
13.8.1.2 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 

For each treatment group, total incidence (i.e. Grade 1 or higher) and incidence of Grade 
3-4  of  each  treatment  emergent  adverse  event,  will  be  summarized  by  patients  using 
frequencies and percentages. For patients with several episodes of the same event during 
the study treatment period, the worst grade will be used. 
 
13.8.1.3 Deaths and Serious Adverse Events 

Deaths  and  the  causes  of  death  will  be  summarized  and  listed  by  treatment  arm 
distinguishing  deaths  occurring  during  the  double-blind  treatment  period  (up  to  30  days 
after the last dose of the study drug) and deaths occurring after the study treatment period. 
 
Serious  adverse  events  occurring  during  the  study  drug  period  (up  to  D30  visit)  will  be 
described by treatment arm. 
 
13.8.1.4 Adverse Events leading to treatment discontinuation

Appendix C: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) –  

Quick Reference 

 

 

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Quick Reference: 
 
Eligibility 
 

•  Only  patients  with  measurable  disease  at  baseline  should  be  included  in 

protocols where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint.  

 

Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable 
disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
cytology/histology.  
 

•  Measurable  lesions  -  lesions  that  can  be  accurately  measured  in  at  least  one 
dimension with longest diameter ≥20 mm using conventional techniques or ≥10 mm 
with spiral CT scan. 

 
•  Non-measurable  lesions  -  all  other  lesions,  including  small  lesions  (longest 
diameter <20  mm  with  conventional  techniques  or <10  mm  with  spiral  CT  scan), 
i.e.,  bone  lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural/pericardial  effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also 
abdominal  masses  that  are  not  confirmed  and  followed  by  imaging  techniques; 
and. 

•  All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or 
calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  

•  The  same  method  of  assessment  and  the  same  technique  should  be  used  to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  

•  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., 
skin  nodules  and  palpable  lymph  nodes).  For  the  case  of  skin  lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is recommended.

154/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

Methods of Measurement  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure 
target lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should 
be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT 
should  be  performed  using  a  5  mm  contiguous  reconstruction  algorithm.    This 
applies  to  tumors  of  the  chest,  abdomen  and  pelvis.  Head  and  neck  tumors  and 
those of extremities usually require specific protocols. 

•  Lesions on chest X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 

defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  

•  When  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  is  objective  response  evaluation, 
ultrasound  (US)  should  not  be  used  to  measure  tumor  lesions.  It  is,  however,  a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, 
subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the 
complete  disappearance  of  superficial  lesions  usually  assessed  by  clinical 
examination. 

•  The  utilization  of  endoscopies  and  laparoscope’s  for  objective  tumor  evaluation 
has  not  yet  been  fully  and  widely  validated.  Their  uses  in  this  specific  context 
require  sophisticated  equipment  and  a  high  level  of  expertise  that  may  only  be 
available  in  some  centers.  Therefore,  the  utilization  of  such  techniques  for 
objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized 
centers.  However,  such  techniques  can  be  useful  in  confirming  complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained. 

•  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response when all lesions have disappeared. 

•  Cytology  and  histology  can  be  used  to  differentiate  between  PR  and  CR  in  rare 
cases  (e.g.,  after  treatment  to  differentiate  between  residual  benign  lesions  and 
residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors). 

 
Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” lesions 
 

•  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions 
and recorded and measured at baseline.  

 

 

•  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter)  and  their  suitability  for  accurate  repeated  measurements  (either  by 
imaging techniques or clinically).  

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

155/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

•  A  sum  of  the  longest  diameter  (LD)  for  all  target  lesions  will  be  calculated  and 
reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference 
by which to characterize the objective tumor. 

•  All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should  also  be  recorded  at  baseline.  Measurements  of  these  lesions  are  not 
required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-
up.  

 

 

 
Response Criteria 
 
Evaluation of target lesions 
 

Complete Response (CR): 
Partial Response (PR): 

Disappearance of all lesions. 

At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  

Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions,  taking  as  reference  the  smallest  sum  LD 
recorded since the treatment started or the appearance 
of one or more new lesions. 
Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to  qualify  for  PR  nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference 
the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. 

Stable Disease (SD): 

Evaluation of non-target lesions 

 

 

Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance  of  all  non-target 
normalization of tumor marker level. 
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits. 

Incomplete Response/  
Stable Disease (SD): 

lesions  and 

Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance  of  one  or  more  new  lesions  and/or 
unequivocal  progression  of  existing  non-target 
lesions  

 

Although a  clear  progression of  “non  target”  lesions only  is  exceptional,  in  such  circumstances,  the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail and the progression status should be confirmed later 
on by the review panel (or study chair).

Evaluation of best overall response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease  progression/recurrence  (taking  as  reference  for  PD  the  smallest  measurements 
recorded  since  the  treatment  started).  In  general,  the  patient's  best  response  assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria

Patients  with  a  global  deterioration  of  health  status  requiring  discontinuation  of 
treatment  without  objective  evidence  of  disease  progression  at  that  time  should  be 
classified  as  having  “symptomatic  deterioration”.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to 
confirm the complete response status. 
 
Confirmation 
 

•  The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the 
response rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it 
should  be  made  clear  when  reporting  the  outcome  of  such  studies  that  the 
responses are not confirmed. 

 

•  To  be  assigned  a  status  of  PR  or  CR,  changes  in  tumor  measurements  must  be 
confirmed  by  repeat  assessments  that  should  be  performed  no  less  than  4 weeks 
after the criteria for response are first met. Longer intervals as determined by the 
study protocol may also be appropriate.  

 

• 

In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least 
once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6-8 weeks) 
that is defined in the study protocol  

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

157/160 

CPR-EFC5505-EN-E03 

 

Duration of overall response 
 

•  The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that 
recurrence  or  PD  is  objectively  documented,  taking  as  reference  for  PD  the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. 

 

 

Duration of stable disease 
 

•  SD  is  measured  from  the  start  of  the  treatment  until  the  criteria  for  disease 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started.  

 

•  The clinical relevance of the duration of SD varies for different tumor types and 
grades. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the protocol specify the minimal 
time  interval  required  between  two  measurements  for  determination  of  SD.  This 
time  interval  should  take  into  account  the  expected  clinical  benefit  that  such  a 
status may bring to the population under study.  

 
Response review 

•  For  trials  where  the  response  rate  is  the  primary  endpoint  it  is  strongly 
recommended  that  all  responses  be  reviewed  by  an  expert(s)  independent  of  the 
study  at  the  study’s  completion.    Simultaneous  review  of  the  patients’  files  and 
radiological images is the best approach.  

 
Reporting of results 
 

•  All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even 
if  there  are  major  protocol  treatment  deviations  or  if  they  are  ineligible.    Each 
patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) 
partial  response,  3)  stable  disease,  4)  progressive  disease,  5)  early  death  from 
malignant  disease,  6)  early  death  from  toxicity,  7)  early  death  because  of  other 
cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). 

 

 

 

•  All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main 
analysis  of  the  response  rate.    Patients  in  response  categories  4-9  should  be 
considered  as  failing  to  respond  to  treatment  (disease  progression).  Thus,  an 
incorrect  treatment  schedule  or  drug  administration  does  not  result  in  exclusion 
from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories 4-9 will 
be protocol specific. 

•  All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. 

•  Sub analyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding 
those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death

REASON FOR AMENDMENT: 
 
1) Pulmonary embolism detection: 
Final analysis of the safety data of the XENOX study (EFC4972) showed a 2.2% difference in 
the incidence of pulmonary embolism between the 2 treatment groups (0.9% and 3.1% in the 
placebo and xaliproden arm respectively). Fifty percent of the reported pulmonary embolism 
in the xaliproden treatment group were asymptomatic events that were incidentally findings at 
the time of per protocol planned radiological tumor assessments.  
 
Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of the patients and to ensure adequate documentation 
of  this  potential  safety  issue,  it  has  been  decided  to  implement,  as  part  of  this  protocol, 
specific monitoring procedures. 
 
2) Echocardiographic evaluation: 
Case  reports  of  unexpected  cardiomyopathy  have  been  rarely  reported  with  xaliproden  in 
patients  with  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis.  These  include  one  case  of  hypersensitivity 
myocarditis  and  three  occurrences  of  cardiomyopathy.  Two  of  the  three  patients  with 
cardiomyopathy  improved  while  xaliproden  was  continued.  All  events  occurred  in  patients 
enrolled  in  open-label,  uncontrolled  extensions  of  randomized  placebo  controlled  trials. 
Exposure to xaliproden was of at least one year in all reported cases. 
 
Although  review  of  the  individual  case  histories  found  no  consistent  trend  or  shared 
pathophysiologic basis it has been decided to further investigate this potential safety issue and 
to  implement,  as  part  of  this  protocol,  echocardiographic  evaluations  at  baseline  and  at  the 
end  of  treatment  with  study  drug,  in  a  subset  of  patients  (patients  from  North  American 
Centers). 
 
3) Evaluation of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN): 
In order to get a more comprehensive neurological evaluation, the time to onset of PSN has 
been added as secondary endpoint. 
Furthermore,  F-wave  latency  evaluation  has  been  added  to  complement  motor  nerve 
conduction studies. 
 
4) Dose  modification  for  mFOLFOX6  has  been  modified  to  indicate  a  reduction  by  one 
dose level instead of 2 for 5-FU and oxaliplatin in case of Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and 
to recommend a reduction by one dose level for 5-FU and oxaliplatin in case of Grade 3 
vomiting despite optimal antiemetics

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES AND WHAT IS BEING CHANGED: 
 
The aim of this amendment is 1) to implement specific monitoring measures for the detection 
of  the  potential  occurrence  of  pulmonary  embolism  2)  to  implement  echocardiographic 
evaluations to document the potential, if any, of xaliproden to induce cardiomyopathy, 3) to 
add the time to onset of PSN as secondary endpoint and to add to the neurological evaluation, 
the measurement of the F-Wave latency, 4) to modify the table for dose modification for the 
modified FOLFOX6 regimen. 
 
These modifications will impact on the following sections of the protocol: 

 

!  Clinical trial Summary. 
!  Flow chart. 
!  Section  4.1.4  Summary  of  the  results  of  the  XENOX  study,  has  been  modified  to 

include the safety results of the XENOX trial. 

!  Section 5 Study objectives, in which time to onset of PSN has been added. 
!  Section  8.1.3.2.2  Dose  reductions,  mFOLFOX6  where  table  (8.1.3.2.2)  has  been 

modified. 

!  Section 9.1.1 Neurological evaluation, has been modified to include the measurement 

of the F-wave latency. Some precisions in the wording were added to the section. 

!  Section 10.1 Safety endpoints assessed in the trial and safety instruction specific to the 
study, has been updated to include the description of the specific safety measures to be 
the implemented. 

!  Section  10.5  Monitoring  (ECG),  has  been  modified  to  implement  a  regular  ECG 
monitoring for the monitoring of potential pulmonary embolism in patients for whom 
no spiral CT of the chest is performed as part of tumor assessment. 

!  Section 12 Study Procedures, has been updated to reflect the changes from sections 5, 

9.1.1, 10.1 and 10.5. This affects sections: 

o  12.1 Baselines evaluations. 
o  12.2 Evaluation during the treatment period. 
o  12.2.2 Every 4 cycles (8 weeks) of chemotherapy. 
o  12.2  Monthly  visits  for  patients  continuing  treatment  with  study  drug  after 

treatment with oxaliplatin is discontinued. 

o  12.3 30-day follow-up visit (post last administration of study drug). 

!  Section 13 Statistical considerations has been updated.  

This affects sections: 

o  13.5.4 Baseline safety parameters 
o  13.7.2.1 Description of the secondary variables 
o  13.7.2.2 Statistical analysis of the secondary variables 
o  13.8.4 ECG 

!  Section 13.8.5 Echocardiography, has been added

a: Screening evalution to be done within 7 days of first dosing with exception of Nerve Conduction Studies, ECG and imaging for tumor measurements 

which have to be done within 14 days, 21days and 28 days respectively prior to first dosing. 

b: Serum chemistry: Baseline work-up will include sodium, potassium, chloride, BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen), serum creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, total 
bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total cholesterol, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The same work-up 
will be repeated every 8 weeks, up to the end of treatment with study drug and at the 30-day Follow-up visit post last study drug administration. During 
the period of chemotherapy, and when this full work-up is not required, a limited pre-dose work-up will be done. It will include sodium, potassium, 
chloride, BUN, glucose and serum creatinine. 

c: Nerve Conduction Studies: A first set will be performed within 14 days prior to randomization. A second one will be done at the end of the treatment 
with oxaliplatin. For  the  patients  reporting PSN≤ Grade 1  at  that  time  (i.e. who will  stop  study  drug as  well)  this  second  set will  be done at  30-day 
Follow-up visit. For the patients reporting PSN > Grade 1 at that time (i.e. who are continuing treatment with study drug for up to a maximum of 3 
months  following  discontinuation  of  oxaliplatin)  the  second  set  of  NCS  will  be  done  at  the  first  monthly  visit  following  oxaliplatin  discontinuation. 
These patients, who are continuing treatment with study drug beyond discontinuation of oxaliplatin, will have a third NCS. It will be done at the 30-day 
Follow-up visit following their discontinuation of treatment with study drug. 

d: Following oxaliplatin discontinuation for other reason than progressive disease, patients will continue to be followed for disease progression ( i.e. q8 
weeks for imaging, and, when applicable for CEA) until it is documented or for 13 months after the first administration of chemotherapy, whichever 
comes first. 

e: After 30-day Follow-up visit, patients with persisting PSN, whatever the grade is, will continue to be followed for PSN recovery. The schedule of the 
evaluations  will  depend  on  the  patient  disease  status.  If  progressive  disease  is  not  yet  documented,  evaluations  will  be  performed  along  imaging 
evaluation visits, i.e. q8 weeks. For patients with documented progressive disease, evaluations will be done along with survival documentation, i.e. every 
3 months. Dates of grade change and date of PSN recovery will be captured in the CRF. 

f: During screening, all symptoms occurring prior to first study drugs administration will be reported either in the “past medical or surgical history” section 
or  in  the  “signs  and  symptoms  present  at  baseline”  section  of  the  CRF.  If  a  serious  adverse  event  occurs  before  treatment,  it  is  to  be  reported  and 
recorded on the CRF SAE form.

i)  Baseline evaluation includes a spiral CT of the chest for all patients to serve as reference documentation in the context of the monitoring for potential 

pulmonary embolism during the period of study treatment. It should be performed within 28 days of first dosing.

ADD at the end of section Table (4.1.4) 5 
 
Table  (4.1.4)  5  summarizes  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  reported  in ≥  2%  excess  in  either  the 
placebo  or  xaliproden  treatment  groups.  Adverse  events  of  diarrhea,  insomnia,  dizziness, 
vertigo,  tinnitus,  oedema  peripheral,  anxiety,  already  known  to  be  reported  in  excess  in  the 
xaliproden clinical trial data-base (patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, section 4.2.5) 
were also reported at higher incidences in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. With the 
exception of diarrhea and pulmonary embolism (PE) there were no severe (Grade 3/4) AEs 
that were reported in ≥ 2% excess in the xaliproden treatment group. 
 
A 2.2% excess of PE was reported in the xaliproden treatment group (0.9% [3 patients] and 
3.1%  [10  patients]  in  the  placebo  and  xaliproden  treatment  group  respectively).  Half  of  the 
cases  (5/10)  in  the  xaliproden  arm  were  incidental  findings  (asymptomatic  patients), 
evidenced at the time of the per protocol planned imaging evaluations for tumor assessments. 
No  particular  time  pattern  for  occurrence  was  observed  (from  cycle  1  of  chemotherapy  to 
cycle  12).  Six  of  the  patients  were  65  or  more  years  old.  Four  patients  had,  in  addition  to 
cancer, risk factors for PE (2 had a history of venous thrombosis, 1 was over-weighted and 1 
had undergone hemicolectomy and partial hepatectomy in the past 3 months). In four cases 
chemotherapy was permanently discontinued. One case was considered fatal (the patient died 
more than 2 months following the event, no pathology was performed).

DELETE  
 
Cumulative PSN will be assessed by the investigator using the severity grading of the specific 
Neurologic Toxicity Scale for Oxaliplatin Dose Adjustments (Table 8.1.3.2.2)3). 
 
This assessment will be done: 

•  At baseline 
•  Prior to each chemotherapy infusion  (i.e. every 2 weeks), 
•  Then  monthly  for  the  patients  continuing  study  drug  beyond  oxaliplatin 
discontinuation  (i.e.  patients  with  PSN  Grade  >  1  at  the  time  oxaliplatin  is 
permanently discontinued). 

•  At the 30-day Follow-up visit, following the last administration of study drug, 
•  Every 2 or 3 months for the patients with persisting symptoms of PSN after the 30-
day  Follow-up  visit  in  order  to  assess  recovery  (every  2  months  when  disease 
progression  is  not  yet  documented,  every  3  months  after  disease  progression  is 
documented). 

 
In addition, NCS will be performed by a neurologist, at baseline (prior to randomization), at 
the end of treatment with oxaliplatin, and for those patients continuing treatment with study 
drug due to a persisting PSN> Grade 1 after discontinuation of oxaliplatin, at the end of the 
treatment with study drug. 
The  baseline  evaluation  should  be  done  within  14  days  prior  to  randomization.  The  second 
evaluation  will  be  performed  after  the  termination  of  treatment  with  oxaliplatin,  i.e.:  at  the 
first “monthly visit” for the patients continuing treatment with study drug beyond oxaliplatin 
discontinuation or at 30-day Follow-up visit for those discontinuing study drug at the time of 
oxaliplatin discontinuation. In this later case the evaluation at the end of oxaliplatin treatment 
and the one at the end of study drug treatment will coincide. A third evaluation will occur, for 
those patients continuing study drug past end of oxaliplatin treatment, at the eventual end of 
study drug dosing D30. Overall patients will have 2 to 3 NCS depending on the duration of 
treatment with study drug. 
 
The NCS will be evaluated as secondary endpoint. 
 
Motor conduction studies will include conduction velocity, compound muscle action potential  
(CMAP)  and  distal  latency  of  the  peroneal  nerve,  on  both  sides,  as  measured  by  standard 
methods.  
Sural  nerve  conduction  velocity  and  sensory  action  potential  (SAP)  will  be  recorded 
antidromically by surface electrodes on each side. When SAPs are not detectable by surface 
electrodes, the near-nerve needle method will be used.  
 
For  each  nerve,  lack  of  response  deemed  by  the  neurologist  to  be  absent  due  to  technical 
reasons will be recorded as missing data. Lack of response deemed by the neurologist to be 
due to nerve pathology will be recorded as absent (zero amplitude).

Safety  evaluation  will  include  AE/SAEs,  biochemistry,  haematologic  evaluations,  ECG  and 
echocardiographic evaluations. Schedule and type of laboratory tests to be performed at each 
time point are described in Section 12. 
The severity of AEs will be determined using the NCI CTCAE v.3.0 scale (Appendix B). 
Conditions  for  chemotherapy  dose  adjustments  /  discontinuation  in  relation  to  AEs  are 
described in Section 8. 
Evaluation of PSN is described in the efficacy section (Section 9.1.1). 
Please  note  that  patients  reporting  PSN  (any  grade)  at  the  30-day  Follow-up  visit  will

10.1.2 Echocardiographic evaluation (patients from US study sites) 
 
In  previous  studies,  case  reports  of  unexpected  cardiomyopathy  have  been  rarely  reported 
with  xaliproden  in  patients  with  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis.  These  include  one  case  of 
hypersensitivity  myocarditis  and  three  occurrences  of  cardiomyopathy.  Two  of  the  three 
patients with cardiomyopathy improved while xaliproden was continued. All events occurred

in patients enrolled in open-label, uncontrolled extensions of randomized placebo controlled 
trials. Exposure to xaliproden was of at least one year in all reported cases. 
 
To  optimize  to  likelihood  to  detect  a  potential  cardiotoxic  effect,  a  two-dimensional 
echocardiography will be performed for all patients at baseline (within 21 days prior to first 
study  drug  administration)  and  at  the  end  of  treatment  with  study  drug  (30-Day  follow-up 
visit). 
 
Collected information will consist of the following: 
 
-M-mode  parameters:  left  ventricular  end  diastolic  diameter  (LVEDD),  left  ventricular  end 
systolic diameter (LVESD), interventricular septum thickness at end-diastole (STED) and left 
ventricular posterior wall thickness at end-diastole (PWTED), 
 
-Two Dimentional echocardiographic parameter: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
 
 
10.1.3 Monitoring for potential pulmonary embolism 
 
Patients  will  be  monitored  for  occurrence  of  potential  pulmonary  embolism  every  8  weeks 
while on treatment with study drug. 
All patients will have a spiral CT (with contrast media) of the chest performed at baseline to 
serve  as  reference  documentation.  During  treatment  with  study  drug,  the  monitoring 
procedure  will  differ  depending  on  whether  the  patient  is  having  a  tumor  assessment  that 
includes a spiral CT of the chest with contrast media. 
 
 
10.1.3.1  Patients  with  tumor  evaluation  that  includes  a  spiral  CT  of  the  chest  with 
contrast media 
 
At  each  performed  tumor  evaluation  and  up  to  30-day  follow-up  visit,  instruction  will  be 
given to the radiologist to systematically review the pulmonary arterial tree. A D-dimer assay 
(ELISA method) will also be performed. 
 
At each evaluation, the following algorithm will be applied: 
 
-Spiral CT is negative for PE and D-dimer assay negative: no further evaluation 
-Spiral CT is positive for PE: no further evaluation required by protocol 
-Spiral  CT  is  negative  for  PE  and  D-dimer  is  positive:  further  evaluation  for  venous 
thrombosis at the investigator’s discretion 
-Spiral CT is inconclusive (and D-dimer assay is positive or negative): further evaluation in 
accordance  with  local  practice  patterns  that  is  adequate  to  rule  out/document  PE  will  be 
performed.

Every  8  weeks  and  up  to  30-Day  follow-up  visit  patient  will  undergo  a  thorough  clinical 
questioning and examination and an ECG will be performed. 
In case the patient reports or presents sign(s) or symptom(s) compatible with a diagnosis of 
PE that has no likely alternative diagnosis to PE, further evaluation in accordance with local 
practice patterns that is adequate to rule out/document PE will be performed. 
 
The clinical questioning and examination should include a search for sign(s) or symptom(s) 
such  as  thoracic  pain  (retrosternal,  pleuritic),  hemoptysis,  recent  dyspnea  (including 
worsening of dyspnea) or cough, syncope, systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, heart rate > 
100/min, low grade fever, cyanosis, signs of new onset heart right-sided failure, signs of deep 
vein thrombosis, new S1, Q3, or right bundle-branch block, or T-wave inversion in leads V1

as plate-like atalectasis, pleural effusion, elevation of an hemidiaphragm).

REASON FOR AMENDMENT: 
 
 
1)  Clarification were requested regarding histological requirements to include patients with 
history  of  colorectal  cancer  treated  by  surgical  resection  who  develop  radiological 
evidence of metastatic cancer. 

 
2)  An upper limit of 3 times ULN for alkaline phosphatase in patients with liver metastasis 
(documented  by  CT  or  MRI  scans  at  baseline)  (inclusion  criteria  n°  17)  was  judged 
unnecessary  low  by  investigators  in  this  patient  setting  and  to  be  a  frequent  reason  for 
patients ineligibility. The limit will be increased to 5 times ULN. 

 
3)  Requirement for an ECG at baseline within limit of normal range (inclusion criteria n° 
13)  was  causing  exclusion  of  potential  patients  that  could  have  received  the  proposed 
chemotherapy. 

 
4)  The limit of 14 days prior to randomization to perform baseline nerve conduction studies 

is causing problems in study sites. 

 
5)  Addition of a statistician to the Data Monitoring Committee. 
 
 
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE AND WHAT IS BEING CHANGED: 
 
The  aim  of  this  amendment  is  1)  to  clarify  inclusion  criteria  n°  1,  2)  to  modify  inclusion 
criteria n° 8, 13 and 17 to improve accrual and to add an independent statistician to the Data 
Monitoring Committee. 
 
These modifications will impact on the following sections of the protocol:

a)  Screening evaluation to be done within 7 days of first dosing with exception of Nerve Conduction Studies, 2-D echocardiography, ECG and imaging 

for tumor measurements which have to be done within 14 days, 21days, 21 days and 28 days respectively prior to first dosing. 

b)  ECG will be performed for all patients at baseline (within 21 days prior to first dosing). Then every 8 weeks, up to30-day FU visit, for the 
patients whom, in the context of the monitoring for potential pulmonary embolim, have no spiral CT of the chest, as part of imaging for tumor 
evaluation 

c)  Patients from US study sites 
d)  Serum chemistry: Baseline work-up will include sodium, potassium, chloride, BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen), serum creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, 
total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total cholesterol, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The same 
work-up  will  be  repeated  every  8  weeks,  up  to  the  end  of  treatment  with  study  drug  and  at  the  30-day  Follow-up  visit  post  last  study  drug 
administration. During the period of chemotherapy, and when this full work-up is not required, a limited pre-dose work-up will be done. It will include 
sodium, potassium, chloride, BUN, glucose and serum creatinine. 

e)  Nerve Conduction Studies: A first set will be performed within 21 days prior to randomization. A second one will be done at the end of the treatment 
with oxaliplatin. For the patients reporting PSN≤ Grade 1 at that time (i.e. who will stop study drug as well) this second set will be done at 30-day 
Follow-up visit. For the patients reporting PSN > Grade 1 at that time (i.e. who are continuing treatment with study drug for up to a maximum of 3 
months following discontinuation of oxaliplatin) the second set of NCS will be done at the first monthly visit following oxaliplatin discontinuation. 
These patients, who are continuing treatment with study drug beyond discontinuation of oxaliplatin, will have a third NCS. It will be done at the 30-day 
Follow-up visit following their discontinuation of treatment with study drug. 

f)  Following oxaliplatin discontinuation for other reason than progressive disease, patients will continue to be followed for disease progression ( i.e. q8 
weeks for imaging, and, when applicable for CEA) until it is documented or for 13 months after the first administration of chemotherapy, whichever 
comes first. 

g)  After 30-day Follow-up visit, patients with persisting PSN, whatever the grade is, will continue to be followed for PSN recovery. The schedule of the 
evaluations  will  depend  on  the  patient  disease  status.  If  progressive  disease  is  not  yet  documented,  evaluations  will  be  performed  along  imaging 
evaluation visits, i.e. q8 weeks. For patients with documented progressive disease, evaluations will be done along with survival documentation, i.e. 
every 3 months. Dates of grade change and date of PSN recovery will be captured in the CRF. 

h)  During  screening,  all  symptoms  occurring  prior  to  first  study  drugs  administration  will  be  reported  either  in  the  “past  medical  or  surgical  history” 
section or in the “signs and symptoms present at baseline” section of the CRF. If a serious adverse event occurs before treatment, it is to be reported 
and recorded on the CRF SAE form. 

i)  Baseline evaluation includes a spiral CT of the chest for all patients to serve as reference documentation in the context of the monitoring for 

potential pulmonary embolism during the period of study treatment. It should be performed within 28 days of first dosing.

6.3  Study committee 

 

A  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  will  be  set  up  with  the  objective  to  review  trial 
enrollment,  compliance  to  protocol,  safety  of  the  administered  treatments  and  quality  of 
the data.  The DMC will consist of two external independent physicians and one external 
independent  statistician  not  associated  with  the  conduct  of  the  study.    This  committee 
will  convene  at  least  every  6  months  to  review  safety  (toxicities  -including  peripheral 
neurotoxicity-  treatment  exposure,  SAEs  including  the  rate  of  deaths-  up  to  30  days 
following  last  administration  of  study  drug)  and  other  issues  related  to  the  appropriate 
conduct of the trial.  
 
DMC  procedures  will  be  detailed  in  the  DMC  charter  and  approved  by  the  DMC 
members.

9.1.1 Neurological evaluation 

for 

Cumulative  PSN  will  be  assessed  by  the  investigator  using  the  severity  grading  of  the 
specific Neurologic Toxicity Scale for Oxaliplatin Dose Adjustments (Table 8.1.3.2.2)3). 
 
This assessment will be done: 
•  At baseline 
•  Prior to each chemotherapy infusion  (i.e. every 2 weeks), 
•  Then  monthly 
the  patients  continuing  study  drug  beyond  oxaliplatin 
discontinuation  (i.e.  patients  with  PSN  Grade  >  1  at  the  time  oxaliplatin  is  permanently 
discontinued). 
•  At the 30-day Follow-up visit, following the last administration of study drug, 
•  Every 2 or 3 months for the patients with persisting symptoms of PSN after the 30-day 
Follow-up visit in order to assess recovery (every 2 months when disease progression is 
not yet documented, every 3 months after disease progression is documented). 
 
In addition, NCS will be performed by a neurologist, at baseline (prior to randomization), 
at the end of treatment with oxaliplatin, and for those patients continuing treatment with

CPRAM02-EFC5505-EN-E01 

 

study  drug  due  to  a  persisting  PSN>  Grade  1  after  discontinuation  of  oxaliplatin,  at  the 
end of the treatment with study drug. 
The baseline evaluation should be done within 21 days prior to randomization. The second 
evaluation will be performed after the termination of treatment with oxaliplatin, i.e.:  at the 
first  “monthly  visit”  for  the  patients  continuing  treatment  with  study  drug  beyond 
oxaliplatin discontinuation or at 30-day Follow-up visit for those discontinuing study drug 
at  the  time  of  oxaliplatin  discontinuation.  In  this  later  case  the  evaluation  at  the  end  of 
oxaliplatin treatment and the one at the end of study drug treatment will coincide. A third 
evaluation  will  occur,  for  those  patients  continuing  study  drug  past  end  of  oxaliplatin 
treatment, at the eventual end of study drug dosing D30. Overall patients will have 2 to 3 
NCS depending on the duration of treatment with study drug. 
 
The NCS will be evaluated as secondary endpoint and will include: 
 
Motor conduction studies of the peroneal nerve in the lower extremities on both sides will 
include conduction velocity, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, distal 
latency, and F-wave latency as measured by standard methods.  
Sensory conduction studies of the sural nerve in the lower extremities on both sides will 
include conduction velocity and sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude to be recorded 
antidromically by surface electrodes with a standard distance of 14 cm. When SAPs are 
not detectable by surface electrodes, the near-nerve needle method will be used.  
 
The skin temperature must be controlled at greater than 32 degrees Celcius at the time of 
recording. 
 
Please, refer to the separate instruction sheet for NCS in this study for more detail. 
 
For each nerve, lack of response deemed by the neurologist to be absent due to technical 
reasons will be recorded as missing data. Lack of response deemed by the neurologist to 
be due to nerve pathology will be recorded as absent (zero amplitude). 
 
The  same  technique  must  be  used  by  the  same  neurologist  at  inclusion  and  at  each 
evaluation. NCS records should be carefully kept at study site.

12.1. Baseline evaluations 

 

Assessments to be carried out prior to randomization are summarized in Table (12.1) 1. 
 
An  interview  will  take  place  involving  the  patient  and  the  investigator  to  determine 
whether or not the patient is eligible to enter the study. It is possible to make use of the 
assessments already performed as a routine procedure within 28 days before registration. 
If it is determined that the patient is a candidate for the study, the patient (or his or her 
legally  authorized  representative)  and  the  Investigator  will  sign  the  informed  consent 
form. The informed consent must to be obtained before any further assessment in order to 
complete the whole clinical study baseline assessments as required per protocol. 
 
If  female,  the  patient  must  not  be  pregnant  or  lactating.    Documentation  of  a  negative 
serum  HCG  pregnancy  test  for  women  of  childbearing  potential  is  required  prior  to 
randomization.    Men  and  women  who  are  fertile  must  use  a  medically  acceptable 
contraceptive  method  throughout  the  treatment  period  and  for  6  months  following 
cessation of treatment with oxaliplatin.  Patients must be made aware, before entering this 
trial, of the risk in becoming pregnant or in fathering children. 
 
Neurological baseline evaluation includes: 
 
Nerve Conduction Studies to be performed within 21 days before the first study treatment 
administration. 
Peroneal  nerve  motor  conduction  velocity  on  both  sides  and  compound  muscle  action 
potential (CMAP) and distal latency will be measured by standards methods. 
Sural  nerve  conduction  velocity  and  sensory  action  potential  (SAP)  will  be  recorded 
antidromically  by  surface  electrodes  on  both  sides.  When  SAPs  are  not  detectable  by 
surface electrodes, the near-nerve needle method will be used. 
The skin temperature must be controlled at greater than 32 degrees Celcius at the time of 
recording. 
 
The  patient’s  neurosensory    status  using  the  Neurologic  Toxicity  Scale  for  Oxaliplatin 
Dose Adjustments to be obtained, within 7 days of first administration of study drug. 
 
The  Investigator  will  evaluate  the  results  of  the  clinical  and  laboratory  assessments  as 
shown in Table (12.1) 1.

aTo  ensure  comparability,  the  baseline  imaging  and  subsequent  imaging  to  assess  response  must  be  performed  using 
identical techniques (i.e., scans performed immediately following bolus contrast administration using a standard volume 
of contrast, the identical contrast agent, and preferably the same scanner). 
 
If the patient’s characteristics comply with all the clinical and laboratory criteria necessary 
for registration, the patient may be randomized and he or she will be allocated a patient 
number according to randomization. 
 
A patient who has not been registered before the first administration will not be accepted 
for the study at a later date.
