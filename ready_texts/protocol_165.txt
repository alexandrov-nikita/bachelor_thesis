Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

Rationale for Amendment 9
(relative to global amendment 6)
In the years since this study was initiated, there have been significant changes in the 
treatment landscape for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with the 
approval of new effective therapies.  In the sponsor’s recent phase 3 trial of orteronel 
conducted in the post-chemotherapy mCRPC population, high rates of crossover to 
subsequent therapy were observed.  Despite an observed advantage in radiographic 
progression-free survival (rPFS), the rate of crossover to subsequent therapy likely 
contributed to an inability to demonstrate a statistically significant overall survival (OS)
advantage in that study.  Given these results, the sponsor believes that achieving a 
statistically significant OS benefit in the C21004 study will become increasingly difficult 
since crossover to subsequent therapy is expected to increase with the duration of the study.
Following consultation with several health authorities and the Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC), the C21004 protocol is being modified to remove the second interim 
analysis for OS (when approximately 450 [50%] deaths have been observed) and to change 
the final analysis to occur after approximately 600 deaths have been observed.  Performing 
the final analysis at an earlier time point than previously planned will provide adequate 
power to observe an OS advantage while minimizing the effect of crossover to subsequent 
therapy and allow those patients still on placebo to receive active therapy sooner if 
warranted.  All remaining unused alpha will be spent at this final analysis.  

Purposes for Amendment 9
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Analysis

 Remove the second interim analysis for OS (when approximately 450 [50%] deaths 
have occurred) and change the final analysis to occur after approximately 600 deaths
 Clarify that the only interim analysis for OS occurred at the final rPFS analysis when 

approximately 412 radiographic disease progression events had been observed

Procedures

 Clarify the requirement of baseline assessments beginning within 28 days before
Cycle 1, Day 1 for patients crossing over to orteronel treatment from Schedule of 
Events #2 (Patients Crossing From Placebo to Orteronel After Unblinding)

 Clarify that results from the last study visit can be used as the baseline assessment 

for patients crossing over to orteronel treatment (Schedule of Events #2)

Study Conduct

 Add language to indicate that patients receiving placebo may be allowed to cross

over to orteronel treatment if the study meets at least 1 of the co-primary endpoints at 
the final analysis.  An IDMC review of the data will not be required

 Clarify the End of Treatment (EOT) visit window in the Schedule of Events

PROTOCOL SUMMARY

Study Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter Trial Comparing Orteronel
(TAK-700) Plus Prednisone With Placebo Plus Prednisone in Patients With Chemotherapy-Naïve 
Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Number of Patients: Approximately 1,454 patients will be randomized into this study from 
approximately 400 study centers worldwide.

Study Objectives
Primary Objectives:

 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone improves radiographic progression-free 

survival (rPFS)

 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone improves overall survival (OS)

Key Secondary Objectives:

 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone improves 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 

response at 12 weeks

 To evaluate changes in circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts 
 To evaluate whether orteronel improves time to pain progression

Other Secondary Objectives:

 To assess the safety of orteronel plus prednisone
 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone increases the time to radiographic disease 

progression or skeletal-related event (SRE)

 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone decreases frequency of SREs
 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone increases 90% PSA response and best PSA 

response

 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone increases time to PSA progression
 To evaluate if orteronel plus prednisone improves time to docetaxel chemotherapy 
 To measure the time to subsequent antineoplastic therapy
 To determine tumor response rate and duration of response in patients with tumor 
lesions that are measurable by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST 1.1)

 To assess global health status as measured by the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), a patient-
reported outcome (PRO) instrument

 To collect blood orteronel concentration data for use in a future integrated 

pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis

Exploratory Objectives:

 To evaluate changes in markers of bone turnover, such as serum N-telopeptide and 
serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, in approximately 240 patients within the 
overall study population

 To explore the relationship between changes in CTC counts and other clinical endpoints 

such as OS and time to disease progression

 To assess archival tumor specimens for candidate biomarkers predictive of orteronel 

antitumor activity including, but not limited to, the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene
 To evaluate polymorphisms in the CYP17 gene, as well as other germline genes 

implicated in the safety or efficacy of orteronel

 To assess the pain location and pain interference scores as measured by the Brief Pain 

Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF)

 To assess functioning and symptom QOL subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30
 To evaluate medical resource utilization (MRU) and calculate utility values using a 

preference-based PRO instrument, EQ-5D, while patients are on study treatment

Overview of Study Design:
This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase 3 study evaluating orteronel plus prednisone 
compared with placebo plus prednisone in the treatment of men with progressive, chemotherapy-
naïve, metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Patients in the 2 treatment groups 
will receive blinded study drug (orteronel or placebo) in addition to open-label prednisone and 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue therapy.  Patients who have undergone 
orchiectomy and have a testosterone concentration of < 50 ng/dL may participate in the study 
without prior or ongoing concomitant GnRH analogue treatment.  One formal interim analysis is
planned for this study after approximately 412 radiographic disease progression events have been 
observed.  The final analysis will be conducted after approximately 600 OS events occur.  If the 
study meets at least 1 of the co-primary endpoints at the final analysis, patients receiving placebo 
may be allowed to cross over to orteronel treatment.
Patients will return for regularly scheduled study visits (treatment/short-term follow-up) for as long 
as they:  1) continue to take study drug (treatment), or 2) discontinue study drug but have not yet 
experienced disease progression (short-term follow up).  Patients will discontinue scheduled study 
visits if they experience disease progression and decide to discontinue study drug.  Patients may 
remain on study drug after disease progression and return for scheduled visits until they receive 
subsequent antineoplastic therapy.  The short-term follow-up portion of the study will no longer 
apply at the time of unblinding.
All patients will be followed for survival (long-term follow-up) after discontinuing the 
treatment/short-term follow-up portion of the study.  Long-term follow-up will continue until death 
or discontinuation of the study by the sponsor.  

Study Population:
Men at least 18 years of age who have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of 
the prostate and documented progressive metastatic disease, based on either radiographic or PSA 
criteria, despite castrate levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL).  Patients must have adequate renal and 
hepatic function and adequate bone marrow reserve based on laboratory assessments, adequate 
cardiac function, an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2, a stable medical condition, a life expectancy 
of 12 months or longer, and either absence of pain or pain not requiring opioid analgesia in the 
2 weeks prior to randomization.  Patients cannot have documented evidence of CNS metastases, 
prostate cancer limited only to the prostate bed or immediate adjacent tissue, uncontrolled 
hypertension, a QTc interval > 460 msec, or uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Prior 
ketoconazole, abiraterone, aminoglutethimide, or orteronel therapy will not be allowed.  Any other 
therapies for prostate cancer, except for GnRH analogue therapy, such as progesterone, 
medroxyprogesterone, progestins (megesterol), or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride or 
dutasteride) must be discontinued 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug. Patients receiving 
placebo must meet additional criteria prior to crossing over to orteronel treatment.

Duration of Study:
It is expected that the study will last approximately 45 months until reaching the final analysis of the 
OS endpoint.  Patients will be followed for survival until 80% of patients have died or are lost to 
follow-up.

a Definitions of treatment and follow-up periods:

 Active treatment is the portion of the study when patients are on study drug and participating in the study according to the treatment period.  Following 

radiographic disease progression, patients will enter the long-term follow-up portion of the study.  Patients may remain on study drug after disease 
progression and return for scheduled visits until they receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy.  
Short-term follow-up is the portion of the study that specifically includes patients who discontinue study drug, but have not yet experienced 
radiographic disease progression.  After radiographic disease progression, patients will then enter the long-term follow-up portion of the study.
Long-term follow-up is the portion of the study when patients will no longer have scheduled visits or assessments, but are followed for alternative 
antineoplastic therapies and survival.





b Screening assessments must begin within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.  All screening laboratory tests, including PSA, must be performed at the central 

laboratory.

c Patients continuing study drug following disease progression should continue to have these study assessments performed according to this schedule until 

treatment with study drug is discontinued.  Testing for each cycle from Cycle 1 through Cycle 7 will be completed every 28 days on Day 1 of the cycle ( 3

d Frequency of assessment is based on Cycle 13 as starting point, eg, Q3C assessments would occur at the beginning of Cycle 16, 19, etc.
e Recording of vital signs and completion of the BPI-SF and ED-5D questionnaires are required at unscheduled visits.  Other assessments should be done as 

clinically indicated.  

f The EOT visit will be conducted 30 days (+ 10 days) after study drug discontinuation or sooner if subsequent antineoplastic therapy is anticipated to initiate 

before 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  The EOT visit should be conducted prior to the initiation of the subsequent antineoplastic therapy.

g Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to radiographic disease progression may remain in the study and will be followed in the short-term follow-up 

period for as long as they continue to meet other eligibility criteria.  Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression and receive 
subsequent antineoplastic therapy will not be followed for disease progression but will be followed in the long-term follow-up portion of the study.  

h Informed consent must be obtained before any study-specific procedures are performed.
i A complete physical examination must be conducted at the screening and EOT visits.  At all other visits, physical exams may be symptom/disease directed.
j Vital sign measurements include diastolic and systolic BP, heart rate, and temperature.  Blood pressure will be taken after the patient has been in a seated 

position for 5 minutes.  At screening, patients may have 2 BP measurements taken no more than 60 minutes apart to exclude uncontrolled hypertension.  For 
eligible patients, only the BP measurement that confirms eligibility should be recorded on the eCRF.

k MUGA scans and/or ECHO; the same modality should be used for a patient throughout the study, and the assessments should be performed at the same 

institution whenever possible.

l For Cycle 1, Day 1 only, all samples must be collected within 3 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
m DHEA-S, testosterone, ACTH, cortisol, and corticosterone samples will be obtained prior to AM dosing.
n PK samples will be obtained at the following times:

Cycle 1, Day 1:  1 sample obtained 1 to 2 hours postdose.
Cycle 2:  2 samples are to be obtained during the clinic visit with the second sample obtained at least 2 hours after the first.
Cycle 4:  1 sample obtained during the clinic visit.

o Bone biochemical markers include serum N-telopeptide and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.  Samples for bone biochemical markers will be 

obtained from approximately 240 patients enrolled in selected countries.  After Cycle 13, bone biochemical markers will be collected every 6 cycles for up to
2 years.

p CTC enumeration and biomarker samples (8.5 mL) must be collected and shipped to the vendor’s laboratory at ambient temperature on the same day.

a Definitions of treatment and follow-up periods:

 Active treatment is the portion of the study when patients are on study drug and participating in the study according to the treatment period.  Following 

radiographic disease progression, patients will enter the long-term follow-up portion of the study, unless the patient remains on treamtent.  Patients 
may remain on study drug after disease progression and return for scheduled visits until they receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy.  
Long-term follow-up is the portion of the study when patients are off study drug and will no longer have scheduled visits or assessments, but are 
followed for alternative antineoplastic therapies and survival.



b Patients who are crossing over to orteronel treatment must meet the criteria outlined in Section 5.3.  Values from the last cycle may be used for these 

patients.

c Patients continuing study drug following disease progression will remain in the treatment period and should continue to have these study assessments 

performed according to this schedule until treatment with study drug is discontinued.  Testing for each cycle from Cycle 1 through Cycle 7 will be completed 
every 28 days on Day 1 of the cycle ( 3 days).  After Cycle 7, Day 1 testing will be performed every 3 cycles (every 84 days  5 days).

e Recording of vital signs and completion of the BPI-SF and EQ-5D questionnaires are required at unscheduled visits (see Section 7.4.24 for further 

information).  Other assessments should be done as clinically indicated.  

f The EOT visit will be conducted 30 days (+ 10 days) after study drug discontinuation or sooner if subsequent antineoplastic therapy is anticipated to initiate 

before 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  The EOT visit should be conducted prior to the initiation of the subsequent antineoplastic therapy.
g Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression and receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy will not be followed for disease 

progression but will be followed in the long-term follow-up portion of the study.  

h After the unblinding, informed consent must be obtained before any study-specific procedures are performed.
i A complete physical examination must be conducted at the screening and EOT visits.  At all other visits, physical exams may be symptom/disease directed.
j Vital sign measurements include diastolic and systolic BP, heart rate, and temperature.  Blood pressure will be taken after the patient has been in a seated 

position for 5 minutes.  At screening, patients may have 2 BP measurements taken no more than 60 minutes apart to exclude uncontrolled hypertension.  For 
eligible patients, only the BP measurement that confirms eligibility should be recorded on the eCRF.

k MUGA scans and/or ECHO; the same modality should be used for a patient throughout the study, and the assessments should be performed at the same 

institution whenever possible.

l For Cycle 1, Day 1 only, all samples must be collected within 3 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
m DHEA-S, testosterone, ACTH, cortisol, and corticosterone samples will be obtained prior to AM dosing.
n If available and consistent with local regulations, archived tumor tissue collected at the time of original diagnosis or subsequent procedures (unstained slides 

or a paraffin-embedded block) will be obtained and evaluated to assess TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene product and other candidate biomarkers predictive of 
orteronel antitumor activity.  Archived tumor tissue can be collected at anytime during the study.

o All questionnaires should be completed before any other study procedures are performed.  The BPI-SF questionnaire should be completed first.  Patients will 

be asked to report their use of opioids during the 24 hours before the study visit.

p The 24-hour opioid-use data collected during the treatment period will be recorded on both the opioid-use and the concomitant medication eCRFs.
q Patients will receive continuous oral study drug twice daily without a rest period.
r After EOT, information on newly prescribed antineoplastic therapies will be collected every 3 months (± 30 days from the last dose of study drug).
s Patients are to be contacted for survival every 3 months ( 30 days from the last dose of study drug).

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

1.   

BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE

Orteronel (TAK-700; International Proprietary Name under consideration) is an orally 
bioavailable, reversible, nonsteroidal inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in androgen 
synthesis.  This study is designed to investigate whether the androgen synthesis inhibitor 
orteronel improves radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) in 
men with progressive, metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that has not 
previously been treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease (chemotherapy naïve).  

1.1   

Scientific Background

Prostate cancer (PC), the most common malignancy in Western societies, is a common cause of 
male cancer-related deaths in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), and Europe.  
Although less common in Asian countries, perhaps related to both environmental and other 
factors, the rates of prostate cancer are rapidly increasing.(1, 2) Over the past 2 decades, prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) testing, where it is used frequently, has significantly decreased the 
number of men who present with metastatic PC (mPC) at diagnosis from 20% in the 1970s to 
3.4% in the 1990s.(3)  Despite the steady decline in the incidence of newly diagnosed mPC, 
following treatment(s) for localized disease, about one-third of the patients will have recurrent 
disease within 10 to 15 years.  Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other 
therapies can delay progression, mCRPC remains an incurable disease.(4)

Androgen deprivation achieved with medical intervention or by surgical castration remains the 
mainstay of mPC treatment.(5, 6, 7, 8)  First-line medical ADT consists of a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist, generally considered standard of care, but may also be 
combined with an antiandrogen (combined androgen blockade [CAB]).  Significant numbers of 
patients will have a clinical response to ADT; however, most will eventually develop 
progressive disease (PD; ie, mCRPC) despite castrate concentrations of testosterone.(9)  Salvage 
therapy for patients with recurrent mCRPC includes second-line hormonal therapy,(10, 11, 12)
systemic chemotherapy, systemic radiotherapy,(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) or supportive care.

Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer

Currently, 3 classes of agents are widely used to treat PC that progresses despite ADT:
antiandrogens (flutamide, nilutamide, or bicalutamide, unless previously administered), adrenal 
androgen suppressors (ketoconazole or, less commonly, aminoglutethimide), and estrogens.  
These therapies provide effective palliation, temporary tumor control, and biochemical 
responses (decrease in PSA in approximately 40% to 87% of patients; 50% decline in PSA 

Confidential

27

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9
levels in 20% to 50% of patients).(19, 20) (21, 22, 23, 24) However, each of these drug classes 
produces only modest, short therapeutic responses in patients with mCRPC.(24, 25, 26, 27, 28)  
Clinical experience with newer drugs that more selectively target androgen production and/or 
are more potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonists confirms that CRPC commonly remains 
hormone dependent.  For instance, treatment with abiraterone acetate, a reportedly irreversible 
steroidal inhibitor of both the 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities of cytochrome P450 
enzyme 17 (CYP17), the key enzyme in glucocorticoid, androgen, and estrogen biosynthesis, 
demonstrated efficacy in preliminary phase 2 trials in patients with PD.  However, toxicities 
attributed to a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess have been noted with 
abiraterone and require administration of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or 
glucocorticoid to suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).(29)

Metastatic CRPC that advances despite these therapies is often treated with docetaxel-based 
chemotherapy.  Docetaxel is an antimicrotubule agent with significant clinical activity in a wide 
range of solid tumors.  Docetaxel-containing regimens have also shown activity in the 
management of mPC.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory 
organizations in Europe and Japan have approved docetaxel in combination with prednisone for 
the treatment of mCRPC, and docetaxel plus prednisone or prednisolone is currently considered 
the standard of care for patients with mCRPC.  This treatment showed an increased survival of 
2.9 months compared with the previous standard of care (mitoxantrone plus prednisone).(30)  
Prior to the docetaxel phase 3 studies, no other chemotherapeutic agent had demonstrated the 
potential to improve survival in patients with mCRPC.(31, 32)  However, median OS remains less 
than 2 years despite treatment with docetaxel plus prednisone.  Outcomes with other 
chemotherapeutic regimens (mitoxantrone plus prednisone or satraplatin plus prednisone) are 
also poor.(33, 34)

Development of Orteronel

Androgen receptors (ARs) remain active in patients with CRPC, suggesting that further 
diminishing testosterone synthesis beyond that achieved by medical or surgical castration is an 
important therapeutic goal.  Activity of ARs in the presence of low androgen concentrations 
may be due to AR gene amplification, increased coactivator expression, activation by growth 
factors, and selection of somatic AR mutations; the AR pathway is amplified in up to 20% of 
CRPC tumors.(35, 36, 37, 38)  In addition, many androgen-responsive genes become upregulated in 
CRPC cells.  Such tumors may respond to more effective ADT that suppresses circulating 
androgens and/or intracellular androgen activity.

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

Orteronel is a selective, nonsteroidal inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the production of 
the common precursor molecules for male and female sex steroid hormones, which are 
synthesized in both the gonads and the adrenal glands.  The selectivity of orteronel for 
17,20-lyase over 17-hydroxylase enzymatic activity may afford it a safer toxicity profile than 
agents that inhibit both steps in the testosterone synthesis pathway and may therefore affect 
cortisol precursor synthesis.  By disrupting the synthesis of testosterone but potentially not 
cortisol, orteronel could offer a more favorable therapeutic index in CRPC.  Whether orteronel
confers therapeutic benefits in patients with advanced cancer is the focus of phase 3 and 
supportive studies.

1.2   

Preclinical Experience With Orteronel

In vitro pharmacology studies indicate that orteronel is a potent inhibitor of human and monkey 
17,20-lyase activity.  The enzyme activities of both 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase are 
associated with CYP17, with the specific enzyme activities likely depending on the 
phosphorylation state of the protein and on available substrates and cofactors within the adrenal 
cortex.  In vitro, orteronel suppressed androgen production in monkey adrenal cells, human 
adrenocortical tumor cells, and mouse and rat testicular cells.  In vivo, orteronel potently 
suppressed serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) production and, to a lesser 
extent, cortisol concentrations in intact and castrated male monkeys.  Detailed information 
regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of orteronel is found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

At high exposures, orteronel has been associated with myocardial atrophy and necrosis in rats 
but has produced neither adverse cardiac or cardiovascular events nor histopathological changes 
in beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys.  Data from 4-, 13-, and 26-week rat studies 
demonstrate an exposure threshold under which no adverse cardiac effects occur, even when 
daily dosing is extended to 26 weeks.

Orteronel induced histopathological hepatic changes, including centrilobular hepatocyte 
vacuolization, in rats at  10 mg/kg/day and in monkeys at 100 mg/kg/day.  These 
hepatocellular changes were generally mild and lacked corroborative evidence of increased liver 
enzyme concentrations in plasma.  Generally reversible, toxicologically significant findings 
were observed in the reproductive organs and the adrenal glands of animals treated with 
orteronel; these changes were considered secondary to hormonal shifts produced by the 
pharmacological action of orteronel.

1.3   

Orteronel Clinical Experience

Seven phase 1 clinical trials have been completed with orteronel in healthy male subjects: 
2 single-ascending oral dose studies using an immediate-release (IR) tablet formulation (01-02-
TL-700-001 and TAK-700/CPH-001), 1 single- and multiple-ascending oral dose study using a 
modified-release capsule formulation (TAK-700/EC-102), 1 relative bioavailability study of 2 
IR tablet formulations (T1 and T2 formulations) (Study C21002), 1 crossover study on the effect 
of food on the absorption of orteronel (Study C21007), 1 study on the absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion of orteronel (Study C21008), and 1 crossover, bioequivalence study 
of 2 IR tablet formulations (T2 and T3 formulations [Study C21009]).

The key observations from the studies in healthy subjects and those in patients with advanced 
mCRPC are that:

 Orteronel has dose-proportional, single-dose, and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK).  
The PK of orteronel is linear.  The steady-state PK profile of orteronel dosed twice daily
(BID) allows for consistent inhibition of adrenal androgen and testosterone production 
throughout the day.  Renal clearance accounts for at least one-third of the elimination of 
orteronel.

 Based on testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) data in healthy 

subjects and in patients with mCRPC whose baseline serum concentrations of 
testosterone were in the castrate range (< 50 ng/dL), doses of orteronel at 300 mg BID or 
above appear to be highly effective for androgen inhibition.  Orteronel 200 mg BID
appears to be a less effective dose.

 Selectivity of orteronel inhibition of 17,20-lyase versus 17-hydroxylase activity is 

relative and appears to depend on orteronel dose.  At orteronel doses < 300 mg BID, 
there is little evidence of 17-hydroxylase inhibition.  Loss of selectivity, ie, partial 
inhibition of cortisol synthesis in response to ACTH stimulation and associated 
activation of the ACTH adrenal axis, is apparent in some men at 300 and 400 mg BID.  
At 600 mg BID, some inhibition of cortisol synthesis is clinically evident with below-
normal serum cortisol concentrations and impaired cortisol responses to ACTH 
stimulation.  Concomitant prednisone with orteronel doses at 400 mg or above appears 
to suppress ACTH and, thus, diminish endocrine adverse events related to 
17-hydroxylase inhibition.  Concomitant prednisone, through suppression of basal 
ACTH activity, is expected to support inhibition of adrenal androgen production.

 Orteronel appears to be generally well tolerated in both healthy subjects and in patients 

with mCRPC.  According to preliminary data from the ongoing phase 1/2 study in 
patients with mCRPC (TAK-700_201):

o As of November 2010, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) reported by 9 or more of the 26 patients in the phase 1 portion of 
the study were fatigue, nausea, constipation, anorexia, back pain, and headache.  
Grade 3 TEAEs experienced by 2 or more patients in phase 1 included fatigue (4 
patients); diarrhea (3 patients); and hypertension, lymphopenia, pain in 
extremity, and vomiting (2 patients each).  The most frequently reported TEAEs 
reported by 15 or more of the 96 patients (15%) in the phase 2 portion of the 
study were fatigue, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, anorexia, headache, hot flush, 
muscle spasms, dizziness, back pain, and hyperglycemia.  Grade 3 TEAEs 
experienced by 2 or more patients in the phase 2 portion of the study included
fatigue (9 patients); hypokalemia (5 patients); hyperglycemia (4 patients);
diarrhea (3 patients); blood creatinine increased, hydronephrosis, hyponatremia, 
international normalized ratio (INR) increased, pneumonia, maculo-papular rash, 
and acute renal failure (2 patients each).  Non-serious skin rash has been 
observed in patients at doses of 300 mg BID or higher.  None of the skin rash 
cases required hospitalization.  As of 19 July 2010, decreases in LVEF greater 
than 10% were observed in 8 (5 Grade 1; 2 Grade 2; and 1 not graded) of 99 
patients in Study TAK-700_201.  See the IB for detailed safety information.  

 The PSA response is the principal surrogate efficacy endpoint in the ongoing 

TAK-700_201 study.  The efficacy of orteronel based on PSA responses after 3 or more 
28-day cycles of therapy was similar for dose regimens of 300 mg BID or higher.  As of 
January 2011, 12 of 15 patients (80%) in the phase 1 portion of the study who received 
orteronel  300 mg for  3 cycles with a 3-month (ie, 12 weeks) PSA determination had 
PSA decreases  50%, of whom 4 had reductions  90%.  Interim data for patients in 
phase 2 are qualitatively similar, with 42 of 81 patients (52%) achieving a 50% PSA 
response by 12 weeks.  The results confirm that orteronel dose regimens  300 mg BID 
are similarly effective regarding the PSA response rate.

based therapy (Study C21005)

1.4   

Study Rationale

Currently, no satisfactory approved therapy exists for patients with mCRPC that has progressed 
despite ADT.  As a selective, nonsteroidal inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key intermediary in the 
testosterone synthesis pathway, orteronel is a good candidate for development in CRPC where 
persistent extragonadal synthesis of androgens in the adrenal cortex or possibly in tumor cells 
results in sustained tumor stimulation and progression.  The goal of this study is to determine if 
orteronel, in combination with prednisone and ongoing GnRH analogue treatment, can alter the 
natural history and/or time course of progressive mCRPC.  In this study, the GnRH treatment 
(or prior surgical castration) will be the background therapy in order to maximize the efficiency 
of 17,20-lyase inhibition.  This investigation is consistent with the goal to begin the use of 
orteronel at a stage of disease where it is likely to be relatively more effective than in very late 
stage disease and where it may forestall the need for more morbidity-associated salvage 
therapies, such as chemotherapy.

1.4.1   

Dose Selection

The orteronel dose selected for the phase 3 studies in mCRPC is 400 mg BID with concomitant 
prednisone 5 mg BID.  Orteronel 400 mg BID is a dose at which significant declines in serum 
PSA and testosterone and adrenal androgen levels have been observed in the TAK-700_201 
study.  Although 400 mg BID is not the maximum tolerated dose for orteronel, non-

Confidential

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

doselimiting but significant fatigue occurred in men treated at the 600-mg BID dose level, 
indicating that the higher dose is not expected to be as well tolerated.  The selection of the 
400-mg BID dose, the highest that is expected to be tolerated, gives the greatest potential for 
antitumor activity.  Although significant declines in serum PSA, testosterone, and adrenal 
androgen levels have been observed in patients treated at both the 300-mg BID and 400-mg BID
dose levels, it is not known whether decreases in the serum levels will be associated with similar 
reductions in testosterone and adrenal androgen levels in the bone and other sites of disease in 
patients.  To maximize potential for antitumor activity, it is appropriate to select 400 mg BID, 
the higher of the 2 doses, for the phase 3 studies in mCRPC.  Orteronel 400 mg BID will be 
administered in combination with prednisone 5 mg BID in the studies in mCRPC.  Dosing in 
combination with prednisone will provide additional potential for efficacy and prevent the 
compensatory ACTH elevation that has been observed in some patients treated at 400 mg BID
in the TAK-700_201 study.

1.4.2   

Continuation of Study Drug Treatment Following Radiographic Disease 
Progression

Patients will be allowed to continue study drug following radiographic disease progression, so 
that very low androgen levels are maintained, potentially slowing the rate of subsequent tumor 
growth.  Continuation of conventional ADT following disease progression is recommended to 
prevent increased circulating androgen levels from interacting with the androgen receptor, 
which remains active in patients with progressive CRPC.  Maintaining castrate levels of 
testosterone with continued ADT despite the development of CRPC is recommended in both the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Association of Urology 
(EAU) guidelines for treatment of prostate cancer.(39, 40) This is based on the understanding that 
the androgen receptor remains active and reports that an increase in circulating androgens from 
castrate levels observed in patients receiving conventional ADT could accelerate tumor 
growth.(41, 42)  It is therefore likely that increases in androgen levels following discontinuation of 
the androgen synthesis inhibitor orteronel could also promote tumor growth.

1.4.3   

The Role of Prednisone

Role of Prednisone as Treatment for mCRPC

Prednisone administered as a single agent has antitumor activity as well as palliative effects on 
pain and quality of life (QOL) in patients with mCRPC.  Corticosteroids (ie, prednisone, 
dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone) have been shown in both phase 2 and phase 3 studies in 
patients with mCRPC to have antitumor activity, positive disease palliation, improvement in 

Confidential

33

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9
pain and QOL, and minimal toxicity.(43) In phase 2 studies with single-agent corticosteroids, 
50% PSA declines have been reported in 34% to 79% of patients with time to progression of 2
to 9 months.(43, 44, 45, 46) In phase 3 studies with glucocorticoids as a control arm, 50% PSA 
responses have been documented in 16% to 22% of patients with time to progression of 2.3 to 
3.8 months.(43, 47, 48) Response durations of greater than 1 year and prolonged symptomatic 
benefits have been reported.(43)

Role of Concomitant Prednisone for Orteronel Administration

As a treatment strategy, prednisone represents a minimally toxic therapy with several potential 
benefits for patients with mCRPC:  activity against PC with a positive influence on QOL, 
prevention of development of drug resistance, and prevention of mineralocorticoid surge.  In 
patients treated with other 17-hydroxylase inhibitors or in patients with congenital deficiency of 
17-hydroxylase enzyme, inhibition of 17-hydroxylase results in transient falls in adrenal cortisol 
production with a compensatory rise in ACTH.  Increased corticosterone, resulting from 
increased ACTH, may compensate for the fall in cortisol and prevent the emergence of adrenal 
insufficiency; however, increased ACTH may be associated in increased adrenal androgen 
precursors.  The addition of low-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone) blocks the physiological rise 
in ACTH and thus supports ongoing inhibition of adrenal androgen synthesis.  

Similarly, elevated ACTH results in increased concentrations of the aldosterone precursors 
deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and 18-DOC that may cause hypertension or edema.  This effect is 
also blocked by low-dose glucocorticoids.  Elevations in ACTH levels have occurred in some 
patients at doses of 400 mg BID and have been more pronounced at 600 mg BID.  This suggests 
that concomitant glucocorticoid administration with orteronel at doses ≥ 400 mg BID is likely
necessary to support ongoing inhibition of adrenal androgens and to prevent or diminish certain 
potential adverse events related to the orteronel mechanism of action.

1.4.4   

Concomitant Therapy Selection

Use of Concomitant Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogue

Orteronel inhibition of residual levels of circulating (adrenal) androgens is most effective if used 
in conjunction with surgical or medical castration because blockade of testosterone synthesis 
normally results in a feedback rise of luteinizing hormone, which in turn promotes testosterone 
synthesis.  In addition, it is standard clinical practice to continue GnRH analogue treatment 
when the patient’s disease progresses and another therapy is required (including docetaxel-based 
chemotherapy).  Consequently, all patients in this study will receive concomitant GnRH

analogue therapy unless they have previously undergone orchiectomy, which is considered to be 
the standard of care for patients with CRPC, and have a testosterone concentration of 
< 50 ng/dL.  

1.4.5   

Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)

Recent advances in the detection and analysis of CTCs has provided insights into the process of 
cancer cell metastasis, and provided a noninvasive means for assessing the prognosis and 
therapeutic response for patients with cancer.  Circulating tumor cells are epithelial in origin and 
can be captured from whole blood using an antibody directed against the epithelial adhesion 
molecule EpCAM and magnetic bead separation technologies.(49)  Investigations in breast, 
colorectal, and prostate cancer have shown that the number of CTCs in whole blood can serve as 
a prognostic marker.(49, 50)  Patients with metastatic CRPC who have ≥ 5 CTCs per 7.5 mL of 
whole blood have a shorter OS and PFS than those patients who have < 5 CTCs.(51)  In addition, 
recent data suggests that CTC enumeration may be a better predictor of patient OS than PSA 
decrement.(52)  Molecular analysis of CTCs may also provide further insight into the underlying 
mechanisms of metastasis and drug resistance.  

1.4.6  

Rationale for Genotyping and Assessment of Biomarkers in Archived Tumor 
Tissue

Emerging data from studies of mCRPC are better defining the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the development of tumor sensitivity and resistance to hormone deprivation.  
Evidence indicates that upregulation of the AR gene can result in increased sensitivity to 
androgens.  Hormone-driven expression of the ERG oncogene after fusion with TMPRSS2
occurs in 30% to 70% of therapy-naïve PCs.(53)  Hormone-dependent overexpression of ERG
may persist in CRPC; hence, tumors with TMPRSS2:ERG mutations may represent a subgroup 
of PCs that remain sensitive to CYP17 blockade.  Assessment of ERG rearrangements in 
therapy-naive CRPC tumors show a significant association between ERG gene status and the 
magnitude of PSA decline (p = 0.007) in CRPC patients treated with abiraterone acetate.(54)  
Two potential mechanisms of resistance to CYP17 blockade are AR mutations and loss of 
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) that could result in constitutive phosphorylation of the 
AR, leading to ligand-independent activation.(55, 56, 57)

Based on these observations, TMPRSS2:ERG translocation, AR, and PTEN mutation status in 
tumor cells will be assessed in tumor tissue as available from patients treated with orteronel.  In 
addition, if warranted by PK, safety, and/or efficacy data, genomic DNA single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) will be examined in the CYP17 gene or in other genes thought to play a

Confidential

35

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

role in predicting the safety or efficacy to orteronel.  The purpose of testing the archival tumor 
tissue specimens for DNA and blood samples for germline DNA is to identify biomarkers that 
will predict patient subpopulations that are more likely to respond to orteronel or have 
significant severe safety events.  The biomarkers will be studied in germline DNA isolated from 
blood and DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tumor blocks of 
tissue collected either at the time of initial diagnosis or during a subsequent procedure as part of 
the patient’s standard of care.  The genetic biomarkers being evaluated from tumor blocks or 
tumor samples are specific to a given tumor type and are not germline DNA.  In addition, CTCs 
remaining after completion of enumeration procedures will be assayed for the presence or 
absence of these genetic variations.  These data may come from a combination of information 
from this study and from future confirmatory studies conducted with orteronel in patients with 
prostate cancer.  As new data emerge over the course of this trial, additional biomarkers may be 
examined based on new scientific findings related to the 17,20-lyase pathway, the effects of 
testosterone lowering and prostate cancer biology, or to the type and number of safety events 
that are observed.  The studies done on the collected samples will add to our knowledge of 
whether and, if so, which biomarkers might predict patient responses to orteronel.  This can lead 
to better treatment options for patients with prostate cancer.  

1.5   

Risks and Benefits

GnRH therapy is considered the standard of care in this study and will be managed as 
background therapy for the patients participating in this study.  The potential risks of orteronel 
and prednisone are outlined below.  

1.5.1   

Potential Benefits

Potential benefits of orteronel treatment are discussed in Section 1.1.  A short summary of 
efficacy observed to date is provided in Section 1.3.

1.5.2   

Identified Risks

Orteronel

To date, clinical data with orteronel have been collected in phase 1 studies in healthy subjects 
and in the phase 1 and 1/2, open-label studies in patients with different stages of prostate cancer.  
The identified risks associated with orteronel treatment include, but are not limited to nausea, 
vomiting, fatigue, hypertension, and non-serious skin rash.  To mitigate the inherent risks in

clinical studies of orteronel, patients are evaluated frequently while they are receiving treatment.  
See the IB and Safety Management Attachment (SMA) for detailed safety information.

1.5.3   

Potential Risks 

Orteronel

Due to its mechanism of action, orteronel treatment may elicit adverse events typically 
associated with androgen deprivation therapy (decreased bone mineral density, hyperglycemia, 
and prolonged QTc interval).  Other potential risks include decreased left ventricular ejection 
fraction, hepatotoxicity, or adrenal insufficiency.  See the IB and SMA for detailed safety 
information.

Androgen Deprivation Therapy

Patients in this study will be receiving ADT at study entry and will have castrate levels of 
testosterone.  Certain risks have been associated with ADT:  osteopenia and osteoporosis,(58, 59, 
60) metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia, central obesity),(61, 62) cardiovascular disease,(63, 64, 65, 66)
and other adverse events (hot flushes, decreased libido, negative impact on health-related QOL, 
impact on cognitive performance, fatigue, lack or loss of energy, loss of initiative, mood swings, 
and increased clinical depression and anxiety scores).(67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72)  With the exception of 
treatment-related fatigue, it is unknown if any of these risks will be altered by treatment with 
orteronel.

Androgens shorten the QT interval, which explains why the QT intervals in women and 
hypogonadal men tend to be longer than those in eugonadal men.(73)  As expected, prolonged 
QT intervals have been observed in men with prostate cancer treated with either GnRH agonists 
or antagonists, although few men had markedly prolonged intervals (ie, > 500 msec).(74, 75, 76)

Prolongation of the QTc interval has been reported as an AE for some patients taking orteronel.  
No dose-related association or apparent effect with orteronel administration on ECG 
morphology was identified.  Patients with QTc intervals > 460 msec are excluded from the 
clinical trial.  

Other

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have been observed in some (8 of 99)
patients enrolled in Study TAK-700_201.  These findings were in the setting of significant 
variation in LVEF measurements within the study.  No correlated trends in patient symptoms, 

Confidential

37

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

electrocardiograms, or cardiac enzymes have been defined.  Additional functional data are being 
collected on patients on study drug to assess cardiac function.  

As of 29 September 2012, 9 SAEs of pancreatitis and 15 SAEs of elevated pancreatic enzymes 
were reported for patients with prostate cancer receiving orteronel in this study.  Twenty-one of 
these 24 cases were considered related to study drug by the investigator.  The role of orteronel 
in these cases remains unclear and a causal relationship between orteronel and pancreatitis has 
not been established.  See the IB for detailed safety information.

Adrenal insufficiency has been reported for 1 patient in the 600-mg orteronel BID-plus-
prednisone cohort in the phase 2 portion of Study TAK-700_201.  Adrenal insufficiency may 
occur, especially in men with decreased adrenal reserve or in men who have acutely
discontinued supplemental glucocorticoids.

T-1358043, a process impurity, drug product degradant, and minor metabolite of orteronel,
tested positive for genotoxicity in laboratory tests and could potentially pose a risk to human 
subjects.  The potential clinical implications of these laboratory results are that any resulting 
genetic or chromosomal change could potentially lead to secondary malignancy and raise the 
risk of heritable defects to offspring.

STUDY DESIGN

Orteronel tablets and placebo tablets will be subsequently referred to as study drug.

4.1   

Overview of Study Design and Conduct

This will be a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to evaluate orteronel plus 
prednisone, compared with placebo plus prednisone, with continuing GnRH analogue in the 
treatment of men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC.  The patient population will consist of 

Confidential

42

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

adult men who have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate 
and documented progressive metastatic disease, despite castrate levels of testosterone 
(< 50 ng/dL).  Progressive disease as a study entry criterion will be defined as either 
radiographic and/or PSA progression following the recommendations of the PCWG2.(32)
Patients will not have received any prior chemotherapy for PC except for remote (2 or more 
years prior to screening) neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment as part of primary local therapy.  
Patients must either be pain-free or have mild pain, regardless of cause, not requiring the use of 
any opioid or narcotic analgesia in the 2 weeks prior to randomization.  Prior ketoconazole, 
abiraterone, aminoglutethimide, or orteronel therapy will not be allowed.  Prior MDV-3100 is 
allowed, and patients will be withdrawn from all antiandrogens 4 weeks prior to the first dose of 
study drug.  Prior sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) treatment is allowed, but patients may not receive 
sipuleucel-T treatment while in the treatment and short-term follow-up portions of the study.  

General eligibility criteria may be assessed prior to the formal Screening period.  However, per 
the Schedule of Events, formal screening will occur during the Screening period, which may last 
for up to 28 days prior to the baseline visit.  Determination of radiographic disease progression 
as an entry criterion may be based on patient data obtained during or following the patient’s 
most recent prior antineoplastic therapy.  Should the patient’s most recent prior antineoplastic 
therapy have included an antiandrogen, disease progression based on PSA criteria alone must be 
demonstrated following withdrawal of the antiandrogen.  One radiographic assessment must be 
obtained during screening, which will serve as the baseline assessment.  

Following the Screening period, patients will be randomized to receive study drug in a double-
blind fashion, either orteronel with prednisone or placebo with prednisone, which will be 
administered BID continuously throughout the study, unless temporarily discontinued for AEs.  
Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles, which will be chronologically timed 
regardless of whether patients are on study medication.  Patients will be seen at regular 
treatment cycle intervals while they are participating in the study: once at the beginning of each 
treatment cycle for the first 7 cycles, then every 3 treatment cycles for the remainder of their 
participation in the active treatment and, if applicable, the short-term follow-up phases of the 
study.

If the study meets at least 1 of the co-primary endpoints at the final analysis, patients receiving 
placebo may be allowed to cross over to orteronel treatment.

Patients will return for the regularly scheduled study visits during the treatment and short-term 
follow-up portions of the study for as long as they 1) continue to take study drug (treatment) or 

Confidential

43

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

2) discontinue study drug but have not yet experienced disease progression (short-term follow-
up).  Patients may remain on study drug after disease progression and return for scheduled visits 
until they receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy.  

Unscheduled visits may occur between treatment cycles as required.  For example, symptomatic 
pain progression should result in an interim unscheduled visit, as would ongoing Grade 2 or 
worse AEs.

All patients will be followed for collection of information on any subsequent antineoplastic 
therapies and for survival (long-term follow-up) after discontinuing the treatment/short-term 
follow-up portion of the study.  Long-term follow-up will continue until death or termination of 
the study by the sponsor.  The short-term follow-up portion of the study will no longer apply to 
patients at the time of unblinding.

Patients will attend an End of Treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of 
study drug and will continue to be followed for other follow-up assessments specified in the 
Schedule of Events.  Patients discontinuing study drug prior to radiographic disease progression 
will continue to be assessed for radiographic disease progression during the short-term follow-
up portion of the study.

Radiographic evaluations will occur at screening, after every 2 cycles for the first 6 cycles, then 
every 3 cycles until disease progression, and thereafter as clinically indicated.  Computed 
tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis, and radionuclide bone scans will be employed to assess the status of the patient’s 
underlying disease and to define radiographic disease progression.  Bone scans will be 
supplemented with CT or MRI of bone as required to clarify ambiguous findings or to further 
define an SRE, eg, new fracture at a site of metastases or spinal cord compression.  A central 
imaging center will independently review films and, for the study endpoint, make the 
determination of whether radiographic disease progression has occurred.  Radiographic 
evaluations will not be collected routinely after study unblinding, but will be left to the 
discretion of the investigator based on clinical need.

Serial blood samples will be collected to quantify PSA and for scheduled safety and endocrine 
laboratory assessments.  Archived tumor material and a CTC sample will be collected to assess 
the presence of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene and other biomarkers predictive of orteronel
antitumor activity, as appropriate.  In addition, a blood sample will be collected for assessment
of germline DNA polymorphisms from patients who consent to this optional procedure.  Studies 
of germline polymorphisms in CYP17 have been linked to PC risk and may play a role in 

Confidential

44

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

outcome after therapy with orteronel.  Analysis of these exploratory biomarkers may refine the 
understanding of the most appropriate therapies for patients with prostate cancer.

Pain evaluation (using the BPI-SF) will include quantified assessments of intensity, frequency 
and duration, degree of discomfort, location, and likely relationship to PC (versus prior therapy 
or comorbidities).  Time to pain progression will be based on pain assessments using the worst 
pain item on the BPI-SF rated on a scale from 0 to 10, collected as outlined in the Schedule of 
Events.  Analgesic use will also be documented as concomitant medications, the recalled level 
of analgesic use during the 24 hours prior to pain assessment when progressing to Step II or 
Step III analgesics (refer to STUDY DEFINITIONS and Section 15.2) will also be used to 
define pain progression.  Patients who experience new onset cancer-related pain will have a 
confirmation assessment obtained at least 3 but not more than 5 weeks later.  Patients who 
experience new or worsening pain between scheduled visits should be seen at an unscheduled 
visit, if necessary, particularly after Cycle 7, Day 1 or when the next scheduled visit is more 
than 4 weeks in the future.  Similarly, between study visits, patients may report the new onset of 
significant, possibly cancer-related pain, and an unscheduled visit for BPI-SF evaluation and 
treatment if necessary will then be arranged.  

Health-related QOL will also be evaluated through the patient self-reported instrument EORTC 
QLQ-C30 and an assessment of patient utilities with EQ-5D.  In addition to assessing selected 
symptoms, these instruments elucidate the effects of disease on physical, social, 
psychological/emotional, and cognitive functioning.  EQ-5D, but not EORTC QLQ-C30, will 
continue to be assed after unblinding.

Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.02.(77)  Adverse events will be assessed, 
and laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, and estimation of ejection fraction determined by 
MUGA scan or ECHO (the same modality should be used for a patient throughout the study) 
will be obtained to evaluate the safety and tolerability of orteronel.

There will be 1 formal interim analysis for this study.  It will occur when approximately
412 patients have experienced radiographic disease progression (regardless of the number of 
new SREs); this will be the only and final analysis for rPFS.  The final analysis will be 
conducted after approximately 600 OS events occur.

Number of Patients

Following screening, approximately 1,454 patients will be randomized into this study from 
approximately 400 study centers worldwide.  

4.3   

Duration of Study

It is expected that the study will last approximately 45 months until reaching the final analysis 
of the OS endpoint.  Patients will be followed for survival until 80% of patients have died or are 
lost to follow-up.

STUDY POPULATION

Confirmation of eligibility must be obtained from the sponsor or designee following review and 
approval of a “Patient Eligibility Checklist” prior to randomization.  See Section 7.4.  In the 
event that patients receiving placebo are offered orteronel treatment after unblinding, patients 
who are crossing over from placebo to orteronel treatment must meet the criteria listed in 
Section 5.3.

5.1   

Inclusion Criteria

Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

1. Male patients 18 years or older.

2. Voluntary written consent, given before performance of any study-related procedure not 

part of standard medical care, and with the understanding that consent may be 
withdrawn at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

3. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate either histologically or cytologically confirmed.

4. Metastatic disease radiographically documented by CT/MRI or bone scan.

5. Progressive disease based on PSA and/or radiographic criteria, defined as 1 or more of 

the following:

 Radiographic disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 (refer to Section 15.1) in 

patients with measurable soft tissue lesions.  For patients with bone disease, 

Confidential

46

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

progression will be assessed following recommendations by the Prostate Cancer 
Working Group (PCWG2; refer to Section 15.1); appearance of 2 or more new 
lesions on bone scan, confirmed, if necessary, by other imaging modalities (such as 
CT scan or MRI), if results of the bone scans are ambiguous.

 PSA progression is defined as an increase in PSA, as determined by 2 separate 
measurements taken at least 1 week apart and confirmed by a third.  If the third 
measurement is not greater than the second measurement, then a fourth measurement 
must be taken and must be greater than the second measurement for the patient to be 
eligible for randomization in the study.  Furthermore, the confirmatory PSA 
measurement (ie, the third or, if applicable, fourth PSA measurement) must be 
 2 ng/mL.  Notes:  Determination of PSA progression can be based on results from 
a local laboratory.  The PSA value obtained from the central laboratory during the 
screening process does not have to be used in the determination of PSA progression, 
but that value should be at least greater than the first PSA used for determination of 
PSA progression.  If a patient has received prior antiandrogen therapy 
(eg, bicalutamide, MDV-3100), PSA progression must be evident and documented 
after discontinuation of antiandrogen therapy.  

6. Prior surgical castration or concurrent use of an agent for medical castration (eg, GnRH 

analogue) with testosterone at screening  50 ng/dL.

7. Either absence of pain or pain, regardless of cause, not requiring use of any opioid or 

narcotic analgesia in the 2 weeks prior to randomization.

8. Screening PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL. (Screening PSA value must be obtained from the central 

laboratory.)

9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 (see 

Section 15.3).

10. Screening clinical laboratory values as specified below:

 Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must 

be  2.5  the upper limit of normal (ULN).

 Total bilirubin  1.5  ULN.

Confidential

47

 Estimated creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault formula must be 

 40 mL/minute (see Section 15.4).

 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  1500/L and platelet count  100,000/L.

11. Patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who:

 Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment 

period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or

 Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual 

lifestyle of the subject.  (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.)

12. Screening calculated ejection fraction of  50% by multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) 
scan, or by echocardiogram (ECHO).  (The same modality should be used for a patient 
throughout the study.)

13. Stable medical condition, including the absence of acute exacerbations of chronic 

illnesses, serious infections, or major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization, and 
otherwise noted in other inclusion/exclusion criteria.

14. Life expectancy of 12 months or more based on general health and prostate cancer 

disease status as judged by the investigator.

or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride or dutasteride), must be discontinued 2 
weeks before the first dose of study drug.

4. Continuous daily use of oral prednisone, oral dexamethasone, or other systemic 

corticosteroids for more than 14 days within 3 months prior to screening (inhaled, nasal,

5. Prior chemotherapy for PC, with the exception of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy as part 
of initial primary treatment for local disease that was completed 2 or more years prior to 
screening.

6. Exposure to radioisotope therapy within 4 weeks of receiving the first dose of study 

drug; exposure to external beam radiation within 4 weeks of receiving the first dose of 
study drug.

study drug or ongoing active participation in another experimental trial related to the 
treatment of PC.  (Patients who are in long-term follow-up following active treatment in 
other trials are eligible.)

9. Current spinal cord compression, current bilateral hydronephrosis, or current bladder 
neck outlet obstruction.  Note:  Patients with definitive local therapy for urinary tract 
obstruction, eg with stents, may be eligible after a review by the study project clinician.

Prednisone (or equivalent) will be labeled as investigational material and will be provided to 
investigative sites by the sponsor; packaging labels will fulfill all requirements specified by 
governing regulations.

6.2   

Study Drug Administration

Study drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the 
investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients may remain on study drug after disease 
progression until they pursue alternative antineoplastic therapy.  Similarly, patients who 
discontinue study drug due to AEs may continue in the study and undergo the scheduled study 
assessments until disease progression or until they decide to pursue alternative antineoplastic 
therapy, whichever occurs first.

Study drug will be given orally twice daily (BID) throughout each treatment cycle of the study, 
except for dose modifications.  Study drug should be taken BID at the same time each day, 
approximately 12 hours apart, and may be taken with or without food.  Missed doses of study 
drug may be taken later, provided that the time of dosing is at least 6 hours before the next 
scheduled dose.  Note: Patients who experience Grade 1 or 2 nausea or vomiting may be 
advised to take study drug with or following meals.  

Patients will be given a diary to record study drug dosing.  If a dose is missed entirely, the 
missed dose will be recorded as “not taken.”

Study drug compliance will be calculated for each patient by taking into account whether a 
patient takes all study drug as instructed.  Patients will be instructed to bring study drug to each 
patient visit for reconciliation.  The number of tablets taken will be calculated by subtracting the 
number of tablets returned from the number of tablets dispensed.  The dosing diary will provide 
supporting information if necessary.

Prednisone will be administered 5 mg BID, orally, throughout each treatment cycle.  It will be 
taken at the same time as study drug.

Dose-Modification and Supportive Care Guidelines

The investigator should determine if an AE is related to study drug.  Adverse events considered 
at least possibly related to study drug may require a dose reduction (Table 6-1), a temporary 
hold, or permanent discontinuation.  

Depending on the AE, following partial or complete resolution of symptoms, the dose of study 
drug may be increased at 2-week intervals to the next higher dose level until the original dose 
level has been reached.  Guidelines for modification of dose based on the severity of the AE are 
provided in this section.  

6.3.1   

Dose Levels for Study Drug

The study drug dose levels to be applied for all dose modifications are defined in Table 6-1.

a Study drug is blinded.  Tablets contain either placebo (0 mg) or orteronel (200 mg).  The dose 

adjustments will be recorded in terms of possible orteronel dose in mg.

6.3.1.1    Dose Modifications

Dose modifications should be based on NCI CTCAE (version 4.02).(77)  Dose reduction for 
Grade 1 AEs is not required.  Dose reduction for Grade 2 events should be considered only 
when the AE is judged by the investigator to be clinically intolerable.  For Grade  2 AEs, the 
dose modification of study drug should follow the Dose Reduction and Re-escalation guidelines 
(Sections 6.3.1.2 and 6.3.1.3, respectively).  For events of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
hypertension, rash, hyperglycemia, worsening renal function, and adrenal insufficiency, refer to 
the Specific Guidelines for Possible Study Drug- Related Toxicities (Section 15.6).

Note that in all cases, dosing with prednisone 5 mg BID should be continued at the time of dose 
modification of study drug, including Dose Level 3 (dosing hold).

6.3.1.2    Criteria for Study Drug Initial Dose Reduction

Dose modifications for Grade 3 or Grade 4 events are described below.

 Asymptomatic Grade 3 or 4 laboratory findings may not require dose modification (ie, 
dose hold or reduction) especially if these are not considered to be clinically significant 
or related to study drug.  The decision to modify the dose should be based on the 
investigator’s clinical judgment.  Dose modifications for Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia 
should follow the guidelines in Table 15-12 in Section 15.6.5.

 Grade 3 or 4 AEs that are considered at least possibly related to study drug require a 
dosing hold (Dose Level 3) for a minimum of 2 weeks.  For a clinically intolerable 
Grade 2 AE that is considered at least possibly related to study drug, the dose should be 
decreased by 1 dose level for 2 weeks.  The investigator should identify other potential 
causes of any AE or laboratory abnormality, and consult with the project clinician for 
any questions regarding the need for dose modification.

Once the dose is reduced, reassessment is required at least every 2 weeks until the event is 
resolved or stabilized; however, the frequency of reassessment should be increased as clinically 
indicated.  If the grade worsens at any time, the dose should be decreased in accordance with the 
guidelines for the worst grade.

6.3.1.3    Criteria for Study Drug Dose Re-escalation

6.3.1.3.1    Re-escalation for Grade 2 Intolerable Adverse Events

Re-escalation of study drug after resolution or improvement of a Grade 2 intolerable AE 
considered at least possibly related to study drug will follow the criteria below:

1.

2.

3.

If the AE grade improves to Grade 0, 1, or 2 tolerable AE, re-escalate the dose by 
1 level.

If the AE remains at Grade 2 and is still intolerable after 2 weeks, decrease the dose by 
another level.

If the event worsens to Grade  3, hold study drug for 2 weeks followed by a 
reassessment.  Follow the re-escalation guidelines for Grade 3 or 4 AEs as described in 
Section 6.3.1.3.2.

Confidential

54

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

Note, the above refers to AEs considered at least possibly related to study drug.  Reassess the 
AE after 2 weeks or sooner if the AE worsens.  Continue to reassess at least every 2 weeks until 
the event is resolved or stabilized.  Continue to adjust the study drug dose until the dose is 
optimally titrated.  If the dose has been held (dose level 3) for 6 weeks, study drug should be 
discontinued permanently.  

6.3.1.3.2    Re-escalation of Study Drug Following a Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Event

Re-escalation following a Grade 3 or 4 AE considered at least possibly related to study drug will 
follow the criteria below:

1.

2.

3.

If the AE grade improves to Grade 0, 1, or 2 tolerable AE, re-escalate the study drug 
dose by 1 level.

If the AE improves to Grade 2 but is still intolerable, hold dosing for another 2 weeks.  
Follow the re-escalation guidelines for Grade 2 intolerable AEs as defined in 
Section 6.3.1.3.1.

If the AE is Grade 3 or 4 after 2 weeks, hold dosing for another 2 weeks and reassess 
again after 2 weeks.

Note, the above refers to AEs considered at least possibly related to study drug.  Reassess the 
AE after 2 weeks or sooner if the AE worsens.  Continue to reassess at least every 2 weeks until 
the event is resolved or stabilized.  Continue to adjust the study drug dose until the dose is 
optimally titrated.  If the dose has been held (Dose Level 3) for 6 weeks, study drug should be 
discontinued permanently.  

6.3.1.4    Criteria for Discontinuation of Study Drug

If the event, considered at least possibly related to study drug, persists at Grade  3 for more 
than 6 weeks, permanently discontinue treatment with study drug.  The study drug dose may 
also be discontinued permanently if judged by the investigator to be clinically intolerable 
despite dose reduction, and the dose cannot be optimally titrated.

6.3.2   

Specific Guidelines for Possible Study Drug-Related Toxicities

Precautions and Restrictions

It is not known what effects orteronel has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or 
fetus.  Therefore, patients should avoid impregnating a female partner.  Patients should use 
effective methods of contraception through defined periods during and after study treatment as 
specified below.

Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to 1 of the 
following:

 Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and 

through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or

 Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual 

lifestyle of the subject.  (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.)

6.7    Management of Overdose

An overdose is defined as deliberate or accidental administration of study medication at a dose 
above that which is assigned to that individual patient.  In the event of drug overdose, the 
principal investigator should be notified immediately and the patient observed closely for 
adverse effects.  The patient should be treated symptomatically as appropriate and the incident 
of overdose and related AEs and/or treatment documented in the patient’s medical record.  
Patients who may have overdosed and who have possible manifestations of adrenal 
insufficiency may be treated acutely with parenteral or oral steroids as tolerated.

6.8   

Blinding and Unblinding

Unblinding

After unblinding and potential crossover of patients is complete, certain applicable procedures, 
as specified in Section 7.4, performed during the blinded portion of the study will no longer 
apply.

Blinding

To maintain the blind, all study site personnel will be blinded to the treatment assignments for 
the duration of the study.

Kit assignments will be obtained through the interactive voice response system (IVRS)
according to the procedures outlined in the Study Manual.  Information regarding the kit
assignments will be kept securely at the sponsor’s location or designee per its standard operating 
procedures.  

Records of the patient number, the date study drug was dispensed, and the kit assignment will 
be maintained by the study site.

If the treatment assignment must be revealed for the safety of the patient or to treat an AE, the 
investigator will contact the project clinician (contact information is in the Study Manual).  A 
decision to break the blind must be reached by the project clinician or designee, and the 
investigator.  The investigator or designee may break the blind through the IVRS independent of 
the project clinician only if it is considered an emergency by the investigator.  The event 
requiring breaking the blind must be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  In 
addition, the patient will be discontinued from further study drug administration in this study.

The investigator must maintain 100% accountability for all study medication received and 
dispensed during his or her entire participation in the study.  If any dispensing errors or 
discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately.

The investigator must maintain a current inventory (drug accountability log) of all study 
medication delivered to the site, inventory at the site, and patients’ use records.  This log must 
accurately reflect the drug accountability of the study medication at all times.  The following 
information will be recorded at a minimum:  protocol number and title, name of the investigator, 
site identifier and number, description of the study medication, expiry and/or retest date, date 
and amount dispensed, and the date and amount returned to the site by the patient, including the 
initials of the person dispensing and receiving the study medication.  The log should include all 
required information as a separate entry for each patient to whom study medication is dispensed.

Prior to site closure or at appropriate intervals, a representative from the sponsor or its designee 
will perform clinical study material accountability and reconciliation before clinical study 
materials are returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction.  The investigator will retain 
the original documentation regarding clinical study material accountability, return, and/or 
destruction, and copies will be sent to the sponsor.

The investigator will be notified of any expiry date or retest date extension of clinical study

Refer to the Schedule of Events for timing of assessments.  The first dose of study drug must be 
administered within 7 days of randomization.  Additional details are provided as necessary in 
the sections that follow.

During the screening process, a “Patient Eligibility Checklist” must be completed and submitted 
by the investigator for review and approval by the sponsor or designee prior to patient 
randomization.  Completion of the eligibility checklist is necessary to verify that the patient has 
met all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively).  Source 
documentation that demonstrates that the patient has documented PD at study entry (Section 5.1, 
Inclusion Criterion #5) must be provided along with the checklist.  Unless specifically 
requested, additional source documentation does not need to be submitted with the checklist for 
the assessment of eligibility related to the other inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Completion of 
a second Patient Eligibility Checklist is not required at the time of crossover to orteronel.

7.4.13    Disease Assessment

Prestudy Documentation of Progressive Disease:

Patients must have documented PD either by radiographic or PSA criteria as defined in 
Inclusion Criterion #5 in Section 5.1.  

Both radiographic PD and PSA PD must be assessed to evaluate eligibility; however, only 
1 criterion (radiographic PD or PSA PD) must be met to satisfy Inclusion Criterion #5.  For the 
radiographic PD assessment, 2 sets of scans using the same imaging modality (ie, CT/MRI or 
bone scan) and taken at separate time points are required to document radiographic disease 
progression during or following the patient’s most recent antineoplastic therapy.  Radiographic 
disease assessment is not required after study unblinding.  Patients are not required to have 
disease progression to cross over from placebo to orteronel treatment.

PSA will be assessed at time points shown in the Schedule of Events.  Results will be available 
to the investigators, but not to the sponsor.  PSA results will not be withheld from the sponsor 
after study unblinding.

The imaging modality for each patient must remain constant throughout the study.  Additional 
scans should be performed at the investigator’s discretion if progression is suspected or to 
evaluate bone lesions identified on bone scans.  For those patients who chose to remain on study 
drug following disease progression, scans should be performed as clinically indicated (eg, to 
follow disease progression or to evaluate progressive pain or SREs).  Radiographic disease 
progression will be defined as described in the STUDY DEFINITIONS section.  

Radiographic images will be maintained at the site, and test results and physician’s findings will 
be filed in each patient’s source documentation.

A central imaging center will review all films, images, and scans that are used in the 
documentation of progression.  The review will be performed on a “real time” basis at the time 
of possible disease progression.  Thus, investigators will be encouraged to await central imaging 
center review of images or scans that may indicate or confirm radiographic disease progression 
before recommending to the patient any treatment or management options, such as 
discontinuation from study drug treatment to pursue alternative antineoplastic therapy.  A 
separate radiography manual and instructions for archiving and submitting images or films for 
review will be provided.  The review of films, images, and scans by a central imaging center 
will not be performed after the study is unblinded, but scans may be performed by sites at the 
discretion of the investigator based on clinical need.

Sites will maintain similar documentation of SREs, including copies of reports of surgical 
procedures, biopsies, or radiographic assessments.

7.4.14    Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry

Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging of the spine and hip will be performed as 
indicated in the Schedule of Events.  DXA imaging will not be collected routinely after study 
unblinding but will be left to the discretion of the investigator based on clinical need.

7.4.15    Tumor Specimen Measurements

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived tumor specimens collected at the time of initial 
diagnosis or during any subsequent procedures (tumor blocks or tumor material sectioned onto 
slides) or CTCs collected specifically for tumor biomarker analysis or collected for enumeration 
and subsequently fixed for further evaluation will be collected as described in the Schedule of

Events and assayed for the presence of candidate biomarkers predictive of orteronel antitumor 
activity, including the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene.  All patients screened for the study will be 
asked to provide access to archival tumor specimens, if available, that have been stored from a 
previous procedure or biopsy.  If archival tumor tissue is available, and consistent with local 
regulations, patients would be required to provide an archival tumor specimen for biomarker 
assessment as described.  

Archived tumor specimens will be shipped to a central laboratory for processing.  Tumor 
material sectioned onto 10 to 20 slides may also be submitted.  Tumor block specimen material 
will be accessioned and any remaining material returned to sites on a quarterly basis.  Archival 
tumor specimens sectioned onto slides will not be returned.  Full instructions for processing and 
shipping of tumor specimens are provided in the Study Manual.

The archival tumor specimens will be identifiable only by patient number and initials; sample 
labeling will be de-identified prior to statistical analysis.  The archival tumor specimen will be 
stored securely at the sponsor’s location or a designated central laboratory vendor until 10 years 
after orteronel receives approval from a governmental agency or until the orteronel program is 
stopped.  The storage period for these samples may be adjusted by country in accordance with 
local regulatory and/or legal requirements for the storage of research samples.  Such changes 
will be reflected in the IRB/IEC country-specific informed consent form.  After that time, the 
samples will be properly destroyed by the central laboratory or designee following approval by 
the sponsor.  The investigator will keep records linking the patient identity with the samples for 
the time required by applicable law.  Patients may also request at any time that their samples 
and material obtained from their samples be destroyed by contacting the investigator.  

7.4.16    Circulating Tumor Cells

Blood samples for CTC counts will be collected as described in the Schedule of Events.  The 
timing of CTC blood samples may be changed if the emerging data indicate that an alteration in 
the sampling scheme is needed to better characterize the effect of orteronel.  The number of 
CTC blood samples may be reduced but not increased based on emerging data during the course 
of the study.  Instructions for processing and shipping of blood samples for CTC counts are 
provided in the Study Manual.  At the central laboratory, the collected CTCs may be fixed for 
further evaluation as described in Section 7.4.15.  At the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit only, 2 samples 
will be collected (1 sample for enumeration and 1 sample for biomarkers).

To maintain the integrity of this blinded study, results from the CTC analyses will not be 
returned to the investigative sites during the active study period.  Samples for measurement of 
CTCs will not be collected after the study is unblinded.

7.4.17   Whole Blood Sample for Germline DNA

A venous whole blood sample (3 mL) for analysis of germline DNA will be collected at 
Cycle 1, Day 1 (before the study is unblinded) from patients who consent to this optional 
collection.  This is an optional part of the study and will not be a mandatory requirement for the 
continued participation of a patient in the study.  Patients who agree to participate in this 
optional part of the study must consent specifically for this procedure.  The DNA sample will be 
assayed using a Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-grade assay for the presence or absence of a 
single nucleotide polymorphism in the CYP17 gene.  CYP17 is the target of orteronel.  If, over 
the course of this study, emerging scientific data indicate that other genes may be responsible 
for predicting response to orteronel or that may predict a safety event to orteronel, then those 
genetic variants may also be examined.  

Individual blood samples for germline DNA analysis, including the result of the analyses, and 
corresponding identifying information will be identified only by a code in a computer database.  
Identifying information, such as the patient initials or patient number, will not appear on the 
tube in which the blood is stored upon processing; instead only the code number will be visible.  
Once a sample is received, it will be logged into the electronic database.  To de-identify the 
patient, an “I” will be entered in place of the patient number and “---” will be entered in place of 
the patient’s initials.

The whole blood sample will be stored securely at the sponsor’s location or its designated 
central laboratory vendor until 10 years after orteronel receives approval from a governmental 
agency or until the orteronel program is stopped.  The storage period for these samples may be 
adjusted by country in accordance with local regulatory and/or legal requirements for the 
storage of research samples.  Such changes will be reflected in the IRB/IEC country-specific 
informed consent form.  After that time, the samples will be properly destroyed by the central 
laboratory or designee following approval by the sponsor.  The investigator will keep records 
linking the patient identity with the samples for the time required by applicable law.  Patients 
may also request by contacting the investigator at any time that their samples and material 
obtained from their samples be destroyed.

7.4.18    Pharmacokinetic Measurements

Blood specimens will be collected from each patient as described in the Schedule of Events.  
Only the PK samples obtained from orteronel-treated patients will be analyzed for the plasma 
concentrations of orteronel and its metabolite, M-I.

The actual date and time of each PK sample collection should be recorded accurately in the 
eCRF.  

In addition, the following dosing information corresponding to each PK sample collection 
should be recorded in the eCRF:

 Time and dose of study drug taken by the patient on the day prior to PK sample 

collection and on the day of PK sampling (if the patient dosed himself on the 
morning of PK sampling).

The sampling schedule is outlined in the Schedule of Events.  Instructions for collection and 
processing of the PK blood specimens are provided in the Study Manual.

To maintain the integrity of this blinded study, results from the PK analyses will not be returned 
to the investigative sites.

Blood samples for PK analyses will not be collected after the study is unblinded.

7.4.19    Pain Assessment

Pain assessments will be performed at study visits as described in the Schedule of Events.  
Patients who experience new or worsening pain between scheduled visits should be seen at an 
unscheduled visit, if necessary, particularly after Cycle 7, Day 1 or when the next scheduled 
visit is more than 4 weeks in the future.  At the unscheduled visits, pain assessments should be 
completed and appropriate management instituted.  In addition, patients who report new or 
worsening pain at either a regularly scheduled visit or are seen for pain at an unscheduled visit 
should have a follow-up visit 3 to 5 weeks later for confirmation of the pain progression and for 
appropriate pain management.  During the first 6 cycles, this confirmation and pain management 
may be at the next scheduled visit (Day 1 of the next treatment cycle).  After Cycle 7, Day 1, 
patients should be seen at an unscheduled visit within 3 to 5 weeks or at the next scheduled visit, 
whichever is earlier.

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) will be the principal pain assessment tool for 
this study.  The BPI-SF contains 15 items designed to capture the pain severity (“worst,” 
“least,” “average,” and “now” [current pain]), pain location, medication to relieve the pain, and 
the interference of pain with various daily activities, including general activity, mood, walking 
activity, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.  The 
questionnaire employs a 24-hour recall period.  The pain severity items are rated on a 0 to 10 
scale, with 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine.

The primary pain endpoint will be “time to pain progression” measured by the worst pain item 
(Item 3) in BPI-SF.  Time to pain progression will be calculated from randomization to the end 
of treatment.

The use of the single item, worst pain, is supported by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, 
and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials recommendations for assessing pain in clinical trials and 
by the European Medicines Agency 2003 Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal 
Products for Nociceptive Pain issued by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products.(79, 
80, 81, 82)  In addition, the newly released FDA guidance uses the following example while 
discussing conceptual frameworks:  “The conceptual framework of a PRO instrument may be 
straightforward if a single item is a reliable and valid measure of the concept of interest (eg, 
pain intensity).”(83)

Pain progression is defined as the occurrence of 1 of the following and confirmed by an 
additional assessment, at least 3 weeks but not more than 5 weeks later:

1. The BPI-SF worst pain score is ≥ 4 with a  ≥ 2 point increase over baseline in BPI-SF 

worst pain score with stable or increased analgesic use; 

2. The BPI-SF worst pain score is ≥ 4 but not less than baseline with new or increased 

(relative to baseline) Step II or Step III analgesic use; 

3. The BPI-SF worst pain score is ≤ 3 but not less than baseline with new or increased 

(relative to baseline) Step III analgesic use. 

Analgesic use can be stable or increased according to the following definitions:

 Stable analgesic use is defined as less than a 25% change of the oral morphine 

equivalent (OME) dose from baseline.



Increased analgesic use is defined as an increase of 25% or more in OME from baseline.

Confirmation at least 3 weeks later is not required if surgical treatment for pain, palliative 
radiation for pain, or subsequent antineoplastic therapy has been received prior to a 
confirmatory assessment (refer to Section 15.2 for a list of WHO Step II or III analgesics).

At the time of each pain assessment including unscheduled visits (See Section 7.4.24), the 
patient will be queried regarding concomitant use of opioid analgesia, if any, as specified in the 
Schedule of Events.  The patient-recalled amount of opioid use during the 24 hours prior to pain 
assessment will be recorded on the opioid use and concomitant medication eCRFs.  

A full BPI-SF instrument will be administered at each of the visits as specified in the Schedule 
of Events to collect the pain severity, location, and interference information with a 24-hour 
recall period.  This must be completed prior to other assessments or study drug being 
administered.  Note that the BPI-SF is not completed beyond Question 1 if the patient denies 
significant pain that may be related to his cancer.  

Patients will complete the BPI-SF at each visit as specified in the Schedule of Events.  Thus, for 
patients who discontinue study drug before disease progression but who remain in the study or 
for patients who continue on study drug following radiographic disease progression, the 
scheduled collection of pain assessment should continue until disease progression.

7.4.20    Quality of Life Assessment

The QOL instrument, EORTC QLQ-C30, will be administered as specified in the Schedule of 
Events.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, 
emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status 
scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, 
insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties).  The time recall period 
for this instrument is 1 week (the past week).  It is a reliable and valid measure of health-related 
QOL in patients with cancer and takes about 11 minutes to administer.  The instrument consists 
of a brief (30-item) questionnaire that has been validated and used in many countries.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 data will be collected as specified in the Schedule of Events, and it must 
be completed before other assessments are performed or study drug is administered.

Data for EORTC QLQ-C30 will not be collected after the study is unblinded.

7.4.21    Utility Measurement

Because oncology therapies may positively or negatively affect a subject’s QOL, a common 
methodologic approach is used to quantify this effect by “quality-adjusting” survival in 
comparative treatment groups.  The result, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), is a measure of 
both the length and quality of life and is used as a measure of benefit in costutility analysis.  
General PRO instruments such as the EORTC QLQ-C30 are not designed to measure subject 
preferences (or utilities) in a way that is suitable for calculating QALYs.  Therefore, a separate 
validated instrument, in this case the EuroQOL EQ-5D, will be used to quantify utilities to 
calculate QALYs for a costutility analysis

The EQ-5D is a 5-item questionnaire and a “thermometer” visual analogue scale ranging from 0 
(worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) that will be administered as 
specified in the Schedule of Events.  The utility measurement should be continually collected 
until the patient discontinues study drug.

7.4.22    Medical Resource Utilization Data Collection

During the treatment and short-term follow-up portions of the study (until the patient 
experiences radiographic disease progression), all medical care encounters will be collected 
from all patients regardless of the reason for the medical care encounter.  Each time an AE or 
unscheduled physician visit occurs, MRU data will be captured.  Examples of data to be 
collected are number of medical care encounters, such as inpatient/outpatient admissions, and 
major diagnostic and treatment procedures.

MRU data will not be captured after the study is unblinded.

7.4.23    Cost Assessment

The cost of treatment in each arm of the study will be assessed through the collection of MRU 
in each treatment arm of the study.  Valuation of the costs will be undertaken separately.

The cost of treatment in each arm will not be assessed after the study is unblinded.

7.4.24    Unscheduled Visits

Unscheduled visits may occur between treatment cycles as required.  Minimum assessments to 
be performed at unscheduled visits are described in the Schedule of Events.  For patients who 
visit the clinic for spontaneously reported pain, the BPI-SF should be completed by the patient

prior to seeing the investigator.  Also, at unscheduled visits, the EQ-5D should be completed as 
the first assessment.  Other assessments may be performed as clinically indicated at the 
discretion of the investigator.

7.4.25   Long-term Survival Status

All patients will be followed for survival (long-term follow-up) after discontinuing the 
treatment/short-term follow-up portion of the study.  Every 3 months (± 30 days from the last 
dose of study drug), information on newly prescribed antineoplastic therapies will be collected 
as part of long-term follow-up as specified in the Schedule of Events.  Long-term follow-up will 
continue until death or discontinuation of the study by the sponsor.  Patients in short-term 
follow-up at the time of study unblinding will move to long-term follow-up.

7.5   

Completion of Treatment

Patients will be considered to have completed study treatment if they receive study drug until 
radiographic disease progression (see STUDY DEFINITIONS section) or until discontinuation 
for unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death.

7.6   

Completion of Study

Patients will be considered to have completed the study if they are followed until death or until
the sponsor terminates the study.

7.7   

Discontinuation of Treatment With Study Drug and Patient Replacement

Patients may receive study drug until:

 Withdrawal of consent

 Receipt of antineoplastic therapy other than study drug (or commercially available 

equivalent), including any experimental therapies

 Death

Study drug must be permanently discontinued for patients who initiate subsequent antineoplastic 
therapy.  Patients who experience disease progression may remain on study drug until they 
receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy or other therapy.  Patients who discontinue study drug 
prior to disease progression (eg, due to drug toxicities) may remain in the long-term follow-up 
portion of the study per the Schedules of Events.

Within 30 days ( 10 days) of the date of study drug discontinuation, all study procedures 
outlined for the EOT visit will be completed as specified in the Schedule of Events.  The 
primary reason for study drug discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF.

Patients who discontinue study drug will not be replaced.

7.8    Withdrawal of Patients From Study

A patient may be withdrawn from the active treatment or short-term follow-up phase of the
study for any of the following reasons:

 Lost to follow-up

 Study terminated by sponsor

 Withdrawal by subject

 Other

The consequence of the patient withdrawing consent is that no new information will be 
collected from the withdrawn patient or added to the existing data or any database.  Collection 
will continue if the patient is withdrawn for another cause.  In addition, survival information 
may be obtained from publicly available records.

STATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES

8.1   

Statistical Methods

A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized before the formal 
interim analysis.

8.1.1   

Determination of Sample Size

There are 2 primary endpoints (rPFS and OS) for this study.  To maintain the overall strong 
control of Type I error rate at 0.05, a fallback procedure proposed by Wiens will be used to test 
the 2 primary endpoints, rPFS and OS, with a pre-assigned alpha of 0.005 and 0.045, 
respectively.(84)

The sample size was calculated based on maintaining 90% power to test the OS primary 
endpoint.  The study is also adequately powered (> 90%) to test the rPFS endpoint.  There is
1 planned interim analysis.

Assuming an exponential distribution for OS, a total number of 900 deaths is required with 90% 
power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.25 (median survival of 27.5 months in orteronel plus 
prednisone group versus 22 months in placebo plus prednisone group) using a 2-sided log-rank 
test at a 4.5% overall significance level (ie, alpha of 0.045).  A total of 1,454 patients will need 
to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either orteronel plus prednisone or placebo plus 
prednisone, assuming an average randomization rate of 35 patients per month for the first 
6 months and 100 patients per month thereafter and a variable follow-up.  Variable follow-up 
means each patient who has not dropped out or died will be followed until the study ends.  Nine 
hundred deaths are estimated to occur within approximately 45 months from the treatment of the 
first patient.  This estimated period includes a 19-month randomization period and an additional 
26-month follow-up from the last patient enrolled.  

Confidential

74

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

The sample size estimation was based on the original protocol assumptions.  In this amended 
protocol (Amendment 9), the final analysis will now be conducted at approximately 600 deaths
(67% of the originally planned 900 deaths).  

The interim analysis will be performed when approximately 412 radiographic disease 
progression events have occurred.  This will be the final analysis for rPFS.  With 
412 radiographic disease progression events and an exponential distribution assumption for time 
to radiographic disease progression or death, it will have 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 
1.5 (median rPFS of 9 months in orteronel plus prednisone group versus 6 months in placebo 
plus prednisone group) using a 2-sided log-rank test at a 0.5% level (ie, alpha of 0.005).  With 
the assumption of an average randomization rate of 35 patients per month for the first 6 months 
and 100 patients per month thereafter, this is expected to occur at approximately 15 months after 
the first patient is enrolled and thus it is the interim analysis of the study.  This is the final 
analysis for rPFS, with the opportunity to claim rPFS benefit at a significance level of 0.005.  
However, the study will not be stopped after the rPFS analysis, even if a significant rPFS is 
observed, in order to allow subsequent analysis of OS.

8.1.2   

Randomization and Stratification

Patients will be randomized to receive orteronel plus prednisone or placebo plus prednisone 
(with continued GnRH analogue therapy, as appropriate) in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by region 
(North America [US and Canada], Europe, and rest of world) and radiographic disease 
progression at baseline (Yes/No).

8.1.3   

Populations for Analysis

The populations used for analysis will include the following:

 Safety population:  The safety population is defined as all patients who receive at least 

1 dose of orteronel plus prednisone or placebo plus prednisone.  Patients will be 
analyzed according to the actual treatment they received.  Patients who received any 
dose of orteronel will be included in the orteronel plus prednisone arm and patients who 
did not receive any dose of orteronel will be included in the placebo plus prednisone 
arm, regardless of their randomized treatment.



Intent-to-treat (ITT) population:  The ITT population is defined as all patients who are 
randomized.  Patients in this population will be analyzed according to the treatment they 
were randomized to receive, regardless of any dosing errors.

Confidential

75

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

 Per-protocol (PP) population:  The PP population consists of all ITT patients who do not 

violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the study outcome 
significantly as determined by the project clinician, who is blinded to study drug 
assignment.  All decisions to exclude patients from the PP population will be made prior 
to unblinding the study.

 RECIST-evaluable population:  The RECIST-evaluable population is defined as a subset 

of patients who have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at the baseline assessment.  

8.1.4   

Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data

All available efficacy and safety data will be included in data listings and tabulations.  The 
relevance of missing sample data will be assessed.  Data that are potentially spurious or 
erroneous will be examined according to standard data management operating procedures.  
Details on any sensitivity analyses and data handling details regarding issues such as missing 
data will be discussed in the SAP.

8.1.5   

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics

Demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, race, weight, height, and other 
parameters as appropriate, will be summarized by treatment groups using descriptive statistics 
only.

8.1.6   

Efficacy Analyses

8.1.6.1    General Methodology

Summary tabulations will be presented by treatment group and will display the number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables, and the number and percent per category for categorical data.  The Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable) will also be provided, along with their 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to event data.

The SAP will be developed and finalized by the sponsor, or its designee, prior to unblinding of 
treatment assignment and the interim analysis.  This plan will outline all data handling 
conventions and specify all statistical methods to be used for safety and efficacy data analysis.  

Deviations from the statistical analyses outlined in this protocol will be indicated in this plan; 
any further modifications will be noted in the final clinical study report.

8.1.6.2    Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoints

The analysis of the primary endpoints, rPFS and OS, and secondary and additional efficacy 
endpoints will be based on the ITT population.  Sensitivity analysis using the PP population will 
be conducted.  Success of the study will be based on either the rPFS or OS endpoint.

To maintain the overall strong control of Type I error rate at 0.05, the fallback procedure 
proposed by Wiens will be used to test the 2 primary endpoints, rPFS and OS, with a 
pre-assigned alpha of 0.005 and 0.045, respectively.(84)  At the formal interim efficacy analysis, 
which is the final analysis for rPFS, rPFS will be tested at an alpha level of 0.005.  If rPFS is 
significant, then the total alpha for testing OS will be 0.05 according to the fallback method.  
Using the O’Brien-Fleming method, the alpha spent at the planned OS interim analysis and final 
analysis would be < 0.00001 and 0.05, respectively.(85)  The first planned analysis for OS will 
occur at the time of rPFS analysis.  If rPFS is not significant at 0.005, the total alpha left for OS 
will be 0.045 according to the fallback method; thus, the alpha spent at the planned interim 
analysis and final analysis for OS would be < 0.00001 and 0.045, respectively.

Radiographic Progression-Free Survival

Radiographic progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization until 
radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.  Final 
analysis of rPFS will occur at the time of the interim analysis, when approximately 
412 radiographic disease progression events have been observed.  

Stratified log-rank testing will be used to compare rPFS between the 2 arms (see Section 8.1.2
for stratification factors).  The hazard ratios along with the 95% CIs will be estimated using the 
unadjusted stratified Cox model.  The proportional hazard assumptions will be examined and 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted if appropriate.  The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and 
Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable), along with the 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for 
each treatment group.  

Overall Survival

Overall survival will be calculated from date of patient randomization to the date of patient 
death due to any cause.  Patients without documentation of death at the time of the analysis will 
be censored as of the date the patient was last known to be alive, or the data cutoff date, 
whichever is earlier.  Stratified log-rank testing will be used to compare OS between the 2 arms.  
The hazard ratios along with the 95% CIs will be estimated using the unadjusted stratified Cox 
model.  The proportional hazard assumptions will be examined and sensitivity analysis will be

conducted if appropriate.  The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if 
estimable), along with the 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.  

There will be 1 interim analysis for OS, which will occur at the final rPFS analysis when 
approximately 412 radiographic disease progression events have been observed.  A detailed 
description of the interim analysis can be found in Section 8.1.9.  The final analysis for OS will 
occur after approximately 600 deaths have occurred.

8.1.6.3    Analyses of Key Secondary Endpoints

In addition to the 2 primary endpoints of rPFS and OS, there are 3 key secondary endpoints 
including 50% PSA response at 12 weeks (PSA 50), favorable CTC enumeration response rate 
at 12 weeks (CTC12), and time to pain progression (TPP).  The key secondary endpoints will be 
tested only once at 0.045 level when OS is significant.  A fixed sequential testing procedure will 
be used to test the key secondary endpoints.  PSA 50 will be tested first.  Then Hochberg 
method will be used to test CTC12 and TPP in parallel.  The details will be fully described in 
the SAP.

50% PSA Response at 12 Weeks

The number and percentage of patients who have a 50% PSA response at 12 weeks will be 
summarized by treatment groups.  The PSA response rates between the 2 treatment groups will 
be tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test at a 5% significance level, 
stratified by the randomization factors.  The CMH chi-square p-value and the relative risk, along 
with its 95% 2-sided CI will also be provided.  In addition, the absolute treatment difference in 
PSA response rates will be provided, along with the 95% 2-sided CI.

Favorable CTC Enumeration Response Rate at 12 Weeks 

The favorable CTC count response rates at 12 weeks between the 2 treatment groups will be 
analyzed in the same fashion as the PSA response rates.  The CMH chi-square test will be used 
to compare the 2 treatment groups.  The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of odds ratio and its 95% CI 
will also be provided.  In addition, the absolute treatment difference in favorable CTC count 
response rates will be provided, along with the 95% 2-sided CI.  

Time to Pain Progression

Stratified log-rank testing will be used to compare time to pain progression between the 
2 treatment arms.  The hazard ratios along with the 95% CIs will be estimated using the

unadjusted stratified Cox model.  The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians 
(if estimable), along with the 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.

8.1.6.4    Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

Prostate-Specific Antigen Responses and Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen Progression

The number and percentage of patients who experienced a 50% PSA response and 90% PSA 
response at 12 weeks and anytime during the study will be summarized by treatment group.  The 
PSA response rates between the 2 treatment groups will be tested using the CMH chi-square 
test, stratified by the randomization factors.  The CMH chi-square p-value and the relative risk, 
along with its 2-sided 95% CI will also be provided.  In addition, the absolute treatment 
difference in PSA response rates will be provided, along with the 2-sided 95% CI.

Duration of PSA response will be summarized descriptively.  Kaplan-Meier survival curves will 
be presented for each treatment group and no formal statistical comparison will be performed 
for this endpoint.

Time to PSA progression will be analyzed in the same fashion as the time to disease 
progression.  The stratified log-rank test and stratified Cox model will be used to compare the 
2 treatment groups and Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable), 
along with their 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.

Quantitation of Circulating Tumor Cells

The number and percentage of patients who have a favorable CTC enumeration count (defined 
as < 5 counts/7.5 mL blood) at baseline and each scheduled assessment time point will be 
summarized descriptively by treatment groups.

The number and percentage of patients whose CTC enumeration meet the following criteria will 
be summarized descriptively at each scheduled assessment time point by treatment groups:  
convert from unfavorable (defined as ≥ 5 counts/7.5 mL in blood) at the baseline assessment to 
favorable, convert from favorable at the baseline assessment to unfavorable, and CTC 
enumeration counts status not changed.

The favorable CTC enumeration response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who 
convert from unfavorable at the baseline assessment to favorable.  The response rates at Day 1 
of Cycle 3 (8 weeks), Cycle 4 (12 weeks), Cycle 5 (16 weeks), Cycle 7 (24 weeks), Cycle 10 
(36 weeks), and EOT between the 2 treatment groups will be analyzed in the same manner as

the PSA response rates.  The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test will be used to compare 
the 2 treatment groups.  In addition, the absolute treatment difference in CTC response rates will 
be provided, along with the 2-sided 95% CI.

The relationship between changes in CTC counts and other clinical endpoints such as OS and 
time to disease progression will be investigated in an exploratory fashion.  The details of this 
analysis will be specified in the SAP.

Time to Radiographic Disease Progression or SRE

Time to radiographic disease progression or SRE is defined as the time from randomization to 
radiographic disease progression, SRE, or death due to any cause, which ever comes first.  
Stratified log-rank testing will be used to compare time to radiographic disease progression or 
SRE between the 2 treatment arms.  The hazard ratios along with the 95% CIs will be estimated 
using the stratified Cox model with treatment as the explanatory variable.  The Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable) along with the 2-sided 95% CIs will 
also be provided for each treatment group.

RECIST-Based Responses

The overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR; defined using RECIST 1.1 and 
PCWG2 criteria) will be calculated for patients in the RECIST-evaluable population 
(Section 8.1.3).  The ORR will be tabulated descriptively with 95% CIs.  The DOR will be 
analyzed using standard survival analysis techniques based on Kaplan-Meier estimates.  In 
addition, the comparison of ORR between the 2 treatment groups will also be tested using the
CMH chi-square test at a 5% significance level stratified by the randomization factors.

Time to Docetaxel Chemotherapy

Time to docetaxel chemotherapy is defined as the time from randomization to the start of 
docetaxel plus prednisone chemotherapy for prostate cancer.  This data will be obtained if 
necessary in phone follow-up with patients after they have withdrawn from the treatment/short-
term follow-up portions of the study.  Stratified log-rank testing will be used to compare time to 
docetaxel plus prednisone chemotherapy between the 2 treatment arms.  The hazard ratios along 
with the 95% CIs will be estimated using the stratified Cox model with treatment as the 
explanatory variable.  The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if 
estimable) along with the 2-sided 95% CIs will also be provided for each treatment group.

Time to Subsequent Antineoplastic Therapy

Time to subsequent antineoplastic therapy is defined as the time from randomization to the start 
of any alternate antineoplastic therapy for prostate cancer.  This data may also be obtained by 
phone or other patient follow-up after patients have withdrawn from the treatment/short-term 
follow-up portions of the study.  Stratified log-rank testing will be used to compare the time to 
next therapy between the 2 treatment arms.  The hazard ratios along with the 95% CIs will be 
estimated using the stratified Cox model with treatment as the explanatory variable.  The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable), along with the 2-sided 
95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.

8.1.7   

Safety Analysis

Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of TEAEs, severity and type of AEs, and by changes 
from baseline in the patient’s vital signs, weight, ECOG performance status, ECG, cardiac 
ejection fraction test results (MUGA or ECHO), DXAs, and clinical laboratory results using the 
safety population.  Exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation will be tabulated.

All TEAEs will be tabulated.  A TEAE is defined as: 1) any AE that occurs after administration 
of the first dose of study drug and up through 30 days after the last dose of study medication; 
2) any event that is considered drug-related regardless of the start date of the event; or 3) any 
event that is present at the baseline assessment but worsens in severity after that assessment or is 
subsequently considered drug-related by the investigator.  Adverse events will be tabulated 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by system organ class 
(SOC), high-level term (HLT), and preferred term (PT), and will include the following 
categories: 

 TEAEs

 Study drug-related TEAEs

 Grade 3 or higher TEAEs

 Grade 3 or higher drug-related TEAEs

 TEAEs resulting in study drug discontinuation

 SAEs, including study drug-related SAEs

Confidential

81

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

The most commonly reported TEAEs (ie, those events reported by  10% of all patients) will be 
tabulated by MedDRA HLT and PT.  A listing of TEAEs resulting in study drug discontinuation 
will be provided.

Descriptive statistics for both the actual values and change from the baseline assessment values 
of the clinical laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry) will be presented for all 
scheduled measurements over time.  Mean laboratory values over time will be plotted for key 
laboratory parameters.  Shift tables for laboratory parameters will be generated based on 
changes in NCI CTCAE grade from the baseline assessment to the worst postbaseline value.

Descriptive statistics for the actual values (and/or the changes from the baseline assessment) of 
vital signs and weight over time will be tabulated by scheduled time point.  

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and change from baseline will be 
summarized.

All concomitant medications collected from first dose of study drug through the study period 
will be classified to PTs according to the WHO Drug Dictionary.

Investigators’ assessments of ECG monitoring (normal, abnormal and clinically significant, or 
abnormal and not clinically significant), including unscheduled or retested measurements, will 
be documented on the appropriate eCRF.

Additional safety analyses may be performed to most clearly enumerate rates of toxicities and 
further define the safety profile of orteronel.

8.1.8   

Analyses of Patient-Reported Outcomes

The PRO endpoint of time to pain progression is also considered as 1 of the 3 key secondary 
endpoints of this study (see Section 8.1.6.3).  The analyses of other PRO endpoints are 
described below.

Quality of Life Assessment:  Time to Deterioration in Global Health Status

The global health status/QOL endpoint will be measured as “time to deterioration in global 
health status” using the 2-item global health status index of the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument.  
Global health status deterioration is defined as a decrease of at least 17 points from the baseline 
assessment on the QOL index, after the score has been linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale 

Confidential

82

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

(see EORTC scoring manual and SAP for details).  A confirmatory measurement obtained at 
least 3 weeks later will be required.

Descriptive summaries of the observed data will be provided for the EORTC QLQ-C30 global 
health status index at each scheduled assessment time point.  Stratified log-rank testing will be 
used to compare time to deterioration in global health status between the 2 treatment arms.  The 
hazard ratios along with the 95% CIs will be estimated using the unadjusted stratified Cox 
model.  The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable), along with 
the 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.  Point estimates of the 
median time to deterioration in global health status will be presented for each treatment group, 
and time to deterioration in global health status will be displayed graphically using Kaplan-
Meier plots.

Additional analyses of pain and QOL-related endpoints will be considered as exploratory.

The following exploratory outcomes will be assessed:

 Time to average pain progression (BPI-SF average pain item)

 Time to increase in pain interference (BPI-SF Items 9a to 9g)

 Time to deterioration in physical functioning

 Time to deterioration in symptoms, including fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting, and 

diarrhea and constipation

Time to average pain progression will be measured by the average pain item of the BPI-SF 
collected at each visit until confirmed disease progression.  The definition of average pain 
progression will be as same as that used for pain progression measured by the worst pain item of 
the BPI-SF, except that the average pain score collected from the BPI-SF at each visit will be 
used.  

Time to increase of pain interference will be based on the pain interference score (average of 
Items 9a to 9g) of the BPI-SF collected at each visit until confirmed disease progression.  The 
definition of “increase of pain interference’ is an increase of ≥ 2 from the pain interference score 
at the baseline assessment, or stable pain interference (< 2 point nonnegative increase from the 
baseline assessment) with the initiation of Step III opioid treatment for pain control.  

Confidential

83

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

Time to decline in physical functioning will be measured by the physical functioning items of 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Items 1-5, or as specified in the scoring manual).  Decline in physical 
functioning is defined as a decrease in the physical functioning score of ≥ 34 from the patient’s 
physical functioning score at the baseline assessment.  Similarly, time to decline in symptoms is 
defined as a decrease in the symptom score of ≥ 34 from the patient’s symptom score at the 
baseline assessment.

For all exploratory pain and QOL endpoints, a confirmatory observation is required at the next 
cycle (at least 3 weeks after the first assessment).  For exploratory pain endpoints, confirmation 
is not required if opioid therapy inadequately controls the pain, and surgery, radiation, or 
alternate antineoplastic therapy is required for pain control, which must have started prior to a 
confirmatory assessment.

For all exploratory pain and QOL endpoints, the relative difference between the treatment arms 
will be analyzed by estimating a hazard ratio and its 95% CI for orteronel plus prednisone to 
placebo plus prednisone from an unadjusted proportional hazards model.

Health Economics Analysis Using Medical Resource Utilization and Utility

The primary health economic outcome is costutility, defined as the difference in the total costs 
of the orteronel group versus the control group, divided by the difference in the QALYs accrued 
by patients in both groups.

Costs will be assigned to the medical care encounters and concomitant medications at the 
conclusion of the study.  These costs will be assigned by matching medical resource data 
collected to databases containing standardized costs for these resources.

Utilities will be calculated using the appropriate scoring algorithms for the EQ-5D.  Average 
utilities for both treatment arms will be multiplied by the average survival in each group to 
determine QALYs.

The secondary health economic outcomes comprise:  1) cost-effectiveness analysis, defined 
similarly to costutility analysis except that the denominator of the ratio is life-years gained (not 
quality adjusted); 2) total costs by treatment; and 3) frequency of MRU by treatment.

The economic data will be analyzed using an ITT approach.  Secondary analyses using patient 
populations defined by various measures of protocol compliance also will be performed.  Data 
for categorical variables will be presented as rates (N, number, percentage).

Data for continuous variables will be summarized using measures of central tendency and 
dispersion.  Variables will be compared between the orteronel plus prednisone and the 
placebo plus prednisone group using appropriate methods; CIs, rather than p-values, will be 
emphasized.

8.1.9   

Interim Analyses

One formal interim analysis is planned for this study.

The interim analysis will be performed when approximately 412 radiographic disease 
progression events have occurred, which is estimated to be 15 months after the first patient is 
enrolled.  This is the final analysis for rPFS, with the opportunity to claim rPFS benefit at a 
significance level of 0.005.  The magnitude of the rPFS will continue to be assessed as more 
data become available; no further p-value will be calculated.  An analysis of OS will be 
conducted simultaneously based on OS data available at the time of rPFS analysis.  The test 
significance of OS at this analysis will be determined by O’Brien and Fleming boundaries and 
the number of deaths observed.(85)  It is anticipated that approximately 152 deaths will have 
occurred by the time of the interim analysis.  Based on this projected number of deaths, the 
alpha spent at this analysis for OS will be less than 0.00001.

8.1.10    Other Exploratory Analyses

Assessment of Patients With ERG Gene-Rearranged and ERG Gene-Unrearranged

Exploratory analyses of efficacy and safety may be performed for patients with ERG gene-
rearranged and ERG gene-unrearranged.

Tumor Biomarkers

The analysis of tumor specimens for candidate biomarkers of orteronel response, including but 
not limited to TMPRSS:ERG fusion gene, will be primarily descriptive in nature, unless the data 
warrant further analysis.

Germline Polymorphisms

The analysis of germline polymorphisms will be primarily descriptive in nature, unless the data 
warrant further analysis.

Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling

Plasma concentration-time data and the associated information of demographics, clinical 
laboratory test results, and concomitant medications obtained from this study will be combined 
with those from selected clinical studies for an integrated PK analysis.  The results of that 
analysis will be reported separately.

STUDY COMMITTEES 

9.1   

Independent Data Monitoring Committee

An IDMC will review safety and efficacy data at the interim analysis.  The IDMC will provide a 
recommendation regarding study continuation based on the safety and efficacy parameters.  In 
the event that the study is terminated early based on an IDMC recommendation, the sponsor will 
notify the appropriate regulatory authorities.  In addition, the IDMC will periodically review 
safety data at regularly scheduled meetings prespecified in the IDMC charter.  Intensive safety 
monitoring will be performed in the early portion of the study.  The first formal safety review 
will occur after approximately 100 patients have been randomized in total and received at least 
1 cycle of study treatment.  Subsequently, periodic safety reviews will also occur as prespecified 
in the IDMC charter.  

10.    ADVERSE EVENTS

10.1    Definitions

10.1.1    Adverse Event Definition

Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product regardless of whether it is related to the medicinal 
product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in 
severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.

Confidential

86

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline.

10.1.2    Serious Adverse Event Definition

Serious adverse event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

 Results in death.



Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).

 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization

(see clarification in the paragraph below on planned hospitalizations).

 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  (Disability is defined 

as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).





Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

Is a medically important event.  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, 
be immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, 
or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein transmitting 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.

In this study, intensity for each AE, including any laboratory abnormality, will be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE (Version 4.02).(77)  Clarification should be made between an SAE and an 
AE that is considered severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe 
are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) 
of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 

Confidential

87

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

(such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event 
outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or ability to function.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily 
need to be considered serious.  For example, a leukocyte value of 1000 to 2000/mm3 is 
considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.

10.1.3    Pretreatment Event Definition

A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who has signed informed 
consent to participate in a study but before administration of any study medication; it does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation.  A serious pretreatment 
AE meets the criterion of a pretreatment event and satisfies any one of the 6 criteria specified 
for an SAE as shown in 10.1.2 (results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or 
prolongation of present hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a medically important event).

10.2    Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 

Adverse Events

All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.4 for the 
period of observation).  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other 
clinical finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as 1 comprehensive event.

Regardless of causality, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section 10.1) must 
be reported (see Section 10.4 for the period of observation) by the investigator to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance’s designee, PPD, (contact information provided 
below).  This should be done by faxing the SAE Form within 24 hours after becoming aware of 
the event.  The SAE Form, created specifically by Millennium, will be provided to each clinical 
study site.  A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study Manual.  Follow-up 
information on the SAE or serious pretreatment event may be requested by Millennium.  SAE 
report information must be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF.

 Adverse events will be reported from the first dose of any study drug through 30 days 

after treatment with the last dose of any study drug or the start of subsequent 
antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first, and recorded in the eCRFs.  That is, if a 
patient begins a new antineoplastic therapy, the AE reporting period for nonserious AEs 
ends at the time the new treatment is started.

 Serious pretreatment events will be reported to the Millennium Department of 

Pharmacovigilance or designee from the time of the signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF) up to first dose of study drug, but will not be recorded in the eCRF.

 Related and unrelated SAEs will be reported to the Millennium Department of 

Pharmacovigilance or PPD from the first dose of study drug through the last treatment
visit (30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug) and recorded in the 
eCRFs.  After this period, only related SAEs must be reported to the Millennium 
Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee.  SAEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illness(es).

10.5    Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events

If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in 
this study, the sponsor must also be contacted immediately by faxing a completed Pregnancy 
Form to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance (see Section 10.2).  Every effort 
should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.

11.    ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS

11.1    Good Clinical Practice

The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the appropriate regulatory requirement(s).  The 
investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the study drug as described 
in the protocol and the IB.

Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

11.2    Data Quality Assurance

The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study patient.  
Study data will be entered into an eCRF by site personnel using a secure, validated, web-based 
electronic data capture (EDC) application.  The sponsor will have access to all data upon entry 
in the EDC application.  

Study monitors will discuss instances of missing or uninterpretable data with the investigator for 
resolution.  Any changes to study data will be made to the eCRF and documented via an 
electronic audit trail associated with the affected eCRF.

11.3    Electronic Case Report Form Completion 

The sponsor or designee will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the 
EDC application, sufficient to permit site personnel to enter or correct information in the eCRFs 
for the patients for whom they are responsible.

Electronic CRFs will be completed for each study patient.  It is the investigator’s responsibility 
to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the patient’s 
eCRF.

The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected.

The investigator must provide through the EDC application formal approval of all the 
information in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endorse the final submitted data for the 
patients for which he or she is responsible.  The audit trail entry will show the user’s 
identification information and the date and time of the correction.

The sponsor or a designee will retain the eCRF data and corresponding audit trails.  A copy of 
the final archival eCRF in the form of a compact disk or other electronic media will be placed in 
the investigator’s study file.

11.4    Study Monitoring

Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by the sponsor will be followed to 
comply with GCP guidelines.

Confidential

91

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

All information recorded on the eCRFs for this study must be consistent with the patient’s 
source documentation.  During the course of the study, the study monitor will make study site 
visits to review protocol compliance, verify eCRFs against source documentation, assess drug 
accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory 
requirements.  The review of medical records will be performed in a manner that ensures that 
patient confidentiality is maintained.

11.5    Ethical Considerations

The study will be conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and will 
adhere to GCP standards.  The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study documentation to 
safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of the patients.  The study will be conducted only at 
sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained.  The protocol, IB, ICF, advertisements (if 
applicable), written information given to the patients (including diary cards and questionnaires), 
safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided 
to the IRB/IEC by the investigator or the sponsor, as allowed by local regulations.

11.6    Patient Information and Informed Consent

After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from either 
the patient or his/her guardian or legal representative before study participation.  The method of 
obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent must comply 
with the ICH GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements.

11.7    Patient Confidentiality

To maintain patient privacy, all eCRFs, study drug accountability records, study reports, and 
communications will identify the patient by initials where permitted and/or by the assigned 
patient number.  The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly 
available to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations.

11.8   

Investigator Compliance

The investigator will conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol provided by the sponsor
and given approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC and the appropriate regulatory 
authority(ies).  Modifications to the protocol are not to be made without agreement of both the 
investigator and the sponsor.  Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC 
approval/favorable opinion before implementation, except when the modification is needed to 
eliminate an immediate hazard or hazards to patients.  The sponsor or a designee will submit all 

Confidential

92

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

protocol modifications to the appropriate regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the 
governing regulations.

When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard or 
hazards to patients, the investigator will contact the sponsor, or a designee, if circumstances 
permit, to discuss the planned course of action.  Any departures from the protocol must be 
documented.

11.9    On-site Audits

Regulatory authorities, the IEC/IRB, and/or the sponsor or designee may request access to all 
source documents, eCRFs, and other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection.  Direct 
access to these documents must be guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support at 
all times for these activities.

11.10    Investigator and Site Responsibility for Drug Accountability

Accountability for the study drug at the trial site is the responsibility of the investigator.  Drug 
accountability records indicating the drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by 
each patient, and amount returned to the sponsor, or a designee (or disposal of the drug, if 
approved by the sponsor) will be maintained by the clinical site.  The sponsor or its designee 
will review drug accountability at the site on an ongoing basis.

All material containing study drug will be treated and disposed of in accordance with governing 
regulations.

11.11    Product Complaints

A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies dissatisfaction 
regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality, or stability of a drug product.  Individuals who

11.12    Closure of the Study

Within 90 days of the end of the study, the sponsor will notify the competent authorities and the 
IECs in all member states where the study is being carried out that the study has ended.

Within 1 year of the end of the study, a summary of the clinical trial results will be submitted to 
the competent authorities and IECs in all member states involved in the study.

Study participation by individual sites or the entire study may be prematurely terminated if, in 
the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor, there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Written 
notification documenting the reason for study termination will be provided to the investigator or 
the sponsor by the terminating party.

Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:

 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients

 Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate





Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements

Insufficient, incomplete, and/or unevaluable data

 Determination of efficacy based on interim analysis

 Plans to modify, suspend or discontinue the development of the study drug

Should the study be closed prematurely, the site will no longer be able to access the EDC 
application, will not have a right to use the EDC application, and will cease using the password 
or access materials once their participation in the study has concluded.  In the event that any

access devices for the EDC application have been provided, these will be returned to the 
sponsor once the site’s participation in the study has concluded.

Within 15 days of premature closure, the sponsor must notify the competent authorities and 
IECs of any member state where the study is being conducted, providing the reasons for study 
closure.  

11.13    Record Retention

The investigator will maintain all study records according to the ICH-GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirement(s).  Records will be retained for at least 2 years after the last marketing 
application approval or 2 years after formal discontinuation of the clinical development of 
orteronel or according to applicable regulatory requirement(s).  If the investigator withdraws 
from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person 
willing to accept the responsibility and the sponsor notified.

12.    USE OF INFORMATION

All information regarding orteronel supplied by the sponsor to the investigator is privileged and 
confidential information.  The investigator agrees to use this information to accomplish the 
study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from the sponsor.  It is understood 
that there is an obligation to provide the sponsor with complete data obtained during the study.  
The information obtained from the clinical study will be used toward the development of 
orteronel and may be disclosed to regulatory authority(ies), other investigators, corporate 
partners, or consultants as required.

Upon completion of the clinical study and evaluation of results by the sponsor, the hospital or 
institution and/or investigator may publish or disclose the clinical trial results pursuant to the 
terms contained in the applicable Clinical Trial Agreement.

It is anticipated that the results of this study will be presented at scientific meetings and/or 
published in a peer-reviewed scientific or medical journal.  A publications plan will be 
developed by the sponsor employees and study investigators.  Subsequently, individual 
investigators may publish results from the study in compliance with their agreements with the 
sponsor.

15.    APPENDICES

15.1    Radiographic Disease Assessment According to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials 

Working Group (PCWG2) and Modified Response Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST Version 1.1)

Radiographic Disease Assessment will be performed using the PCWG2 guidelines.  The 
PCWG2 recommended that for soft tissue lesions that RECIST 1.1 assessment be applied and 
that results be compiled separately from the overall disease assessment, which includes both 
bone scan and RECIST 1.1 results.  

Under RECIST 1.1, radionuclide bone scan lesions are considered not measurable, and hence 
nontarget.  Under RECIST, bone scan progression occurs when the changes are “unequivocal.”  
Under PCWG2, however, radionuclide bone scan results are treated semi-quantitatively and 
occurrence of new lesions may define progression as outlined further below.  For this protocol, 
soft tissue and bone scan disease are evaluated separately, and the results of each are then 
considered in an overall radiographic disease assessment.

15.1.1    Recording Baseline Assessments

All sites of disease, target, and nontarget lesions must be assessed at baseline.  Objective disease 
status is to be recorded at each evaluation using the response categories and definitions provided 
in this section.

15.1.1.1   Soft Tissue Lesion Assessment

Selection of Target and Nontarget Lesions 

All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, representative 
of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability for reproducible repeated 
measurements.  Measurements must be provided for target measurable lesions.

Selection of a Lymph Node as a Target Lesion

Only lymph nodes with the longest diameter of ≥ 2 cm*(32) and a minimum short axis diameter 
of ≥ 1.5 cm by CT scan will be considered as target lesion at baseline.  All other lesions may be 

                                                
* PCGW2 guidelines.

considered as nontarget and are to be identified but not specifically measured at baseline, with 
the exception of bone scan metastases, which are identified and enumerated.  

15.1.1.2    Soft Tissue Assessments Following Baseline

Confirmation of response is not required, except as follows:

If either 1) a new soft tissue lesions or 2) a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions (see below) are identified at the first follow-up assessment after start of study drug, then 
the new lesions or increase in sum of diameters must be confirmed as still present at the second 
follow-up assessment 6 or more weeks later.

Beginning at the second follow-up assessment and thereafter, no subsequent confirmation is 
required for 1) newly occurring soft tissue lesions; or 2) a new increase in lesion sum of 
diameters meeting disease progression criteria, or 3) unequivocal progression of non-target soft 
tissue lesions.

For the assessment of lymph nodes, only report changes in lymph nodes that were 2 cm in the 
longest diameter at baseline.(32)

15.1.2    Response Definitions for RECIST-Evaluable Soft Tissue Lesions

15.1.2.1

Definition of Complete Response

Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) 
must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.

15.1.2.2   Definition of Partial Response

At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum of longest diameters of non-lymph node lesions and of the short diameter(s) or 
short axis (SA) of lymph nodes.  

15.1.2.3

Definition of Stable Disease

Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR) nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.

Confidential

107

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

15.1.2.4    Definition of Soft Tissue Progression

At least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 
at least 5 mm.  

NOTE:  The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression, except for 
lymph node and bone lesions as follows.

15.1.2.4.1   Assessment of Soft Tissue Time Point Response

The following table summarizes the RECIST 1.1 response status calculation at each time point 
for patients who have measurable soft tissue disease at baseline.  Note that this assessment does 
not include bone scan assessment and is not the overall assessment of radiographic disease 
status.

15.1.3    Radionuclide Bone Scan Assessment 

15.1.3.1

Baseline Assessment

Bone scan lesions should be enumerated at baseline.  Questionable lesions, eg, sites of previous 
fracture, may require confirmation by CT or s.

15.1.3.2    Post Baseline Assessments and Definition of Progression of Bone Metastatic 

Disease Based on Radionuclide Bone Scan

Bone scan lesions should be assessed and enumerated at each follow-up assessment.  

Progression on bone scan is defined as 2 or more new lesions on radionuclide bone scans.  
Should 2 or more new bone lesions be evident at the first assessment on treatment (Cycle 3, Day 
1), 2 or more additional new lesions must be evident on a confirmatory assessment at least 6 
weeks later (and no sooner than 12 weeks after the start of dosing, per protocol scheduled at 
Cycle 5, Day 1).  This confirmation is not required when 2 or more new lesions (compared to 
baseline or to the Cycle 3, Day 1 assessment) first appear after the first follow-up assessment, ie, 
at Cycle 5, Day 1 or thereafter.  

Should new bone lesions be documented at Cycle 3, Day 1 but not confirmed at Cycle 5, Day 1, 
then Cycle 3, Day 1 becomes the new baseline and 2 or more new lesions at subsequent 
assessments relative to Cycle 3, Day 1 defines bone scan progression.

Stable disease (SD) on bone scan stable disease is defined as the absence of progression.  Bone 
scan lesions are considered non-evaluable under RECIST, and thus there can be no partial 
response.  Complete response is very rare.  Thus, almost all bone scans will be rated as NE (no 
lesions present), SD, or PD.

Overall Response Assessment 

15.1.4
The following table summarizes the overall response status calculation at each time point for 
patients who have either RECIST 1.1 evaluable soft tissue lesions and/or radionuclide bone scan 
lesions.  Note that CR can only occur if there are RECIST 1.1-evaluable lesions and no bone 
lesions based on radionuclide bone scan.  PR can occur if patients have CR or PR based on soft 
tissue evaluation and bone scan lesions that are stable.

a Opioid drugs NOT recommended include meperidine, methadone, propoxyphene, partial agonists 
(buprenorphine), and mixed agonist-antagonists (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine).

b Oral morphine equivalent (OME) score is based on an oral morphine dose of 30 mg; the conversion 

factor listed is for chronic dosing.  Avoid using morphine in renal failure.

c Available in transdermal system for extended dosing.  See the calculation below for dose conversion 

from other opioids to transdermal fentanyl.

d Weak opioid receptor agonist with some antidepressant activity; for mild to moderate pain.  

Recommended dose of 100 mg 4 times daily (maximum daily dose of 400 mg) to avoid central nervous 
system toxicity.  At maximum dose, tramadol is less potent than other opioid analgesics.

Oral Morphine Equivalence Conversion Calculation

To calculate the oral morphine equivalent (OME) score of an opioid in Table 15-4:

X  dose of an opioid equivalent to an oral morphine dose of 30 mg
Y  dose of that opioid consumed by the patient in the last 24 hours
OME of that opioid consumed in the last 24 hours  Y / X  30

Example:  A patient consumed 100 mg of oral codeine in the last 24 hours.  The OME 
calculation is:

X  200 mg
Y  100 mg
OME of oral codeine  100 / 200  30  15 mg

15.6    Specific Guidelines for Possible Study Drug-Related Toxicities

15.6.1    Fatigue

Fatigue is defined as a disorder characterized by a state of generalized weakness with a 
pronounced inability to summon sufficient energy to accomplish daily activities.

Confidential

118

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

In the open-label, phase1/2 study (TAK-700_201), patients have experienced fatigue.  Most 
events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  Grade 3 fatigue was experienced by some patients, 
including those who received concomitant prednisone.  Other factors such as acute androgen 
deprivation may also be contributing to symptoms.  Prior to dose modification, the investigator 
should confirm that the patient is receiving prednisone 5 mg BID.  Table 15-6 summarizes the 
CTCAE Criteria (version 4.02)(77) for fatigue and the appropriate actions to be followed.

Dose modification for Grade 2 fatigue is optional but may be helpful by slowing the induction 
to full androgen deprivation.  Grade 3 fatigue should be treated according to the general outlines 
in Section 6.3.1, including initial hold of dosing and re-introduction of study drug with 
subsequent titration at 2-week intervals to the patient’s tolerated dose level.

15.6.2    Gastrointestinal Adverse Events

In previous and ongoing clinical studies, episodic and not necessarily dose-related GI toxicities 
have occurred.  

Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea is defined as a disorder characterized by a queasy sensation and/or the urge to vomit.

If new onset or worsening of established hypertension occurs and the potassium level is 
< 3.5 mg/dL, in the absence of other causes such as new diuretic therapy, it suggests a study 
drug-related mineralocorticoid syndrome and should be followed by review of the patient’s 
compliance with the prednisone regime.  A plasma renin activity that is undetectable or low also 
suggests such a syndrome rather than a secondary cause.  While addressing either underlying

factors or compliance with current antihypertensives or prednisone dosing, dose modification 
should be initiated according to the general guidelines outlined in Section 6.3.

If other causes are identified as the reason for new or worsening hypertension, the investigator

15.6.5    Hyperglycemia

Event Definition

Action Required

Hyperglycemia is a disorder characterized by laboratory test results that indicate an elevation in 
the concentration of blood sugar.  It is usually an indication of diabetes mellitus or glucose 
intolerance.  Androgen deprivation has been associated with new onset of diabetes.  Prednisone, 
at the doses used in this protocol, may also worsen underlying glucose tolerance or pre-existing 
diabetes.  However, because the progression of prostate cancer is of immediate importance to 
the patient, study investigators are encouraged to not modify the prednisone or study drug
therapeutic dose regimen unless other adjustments to the antidiabetic regimen are unsuccessful 
or for Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (see Table 15-12 below).  

If the patient has a medical history of diabetes mellitus (type I or type II), the patient’s diabetes 
should be followed frequently per local standard of care.  A physician experienced in the 
management of diabetes should be involved in the patient’s care.  Patients should be counseled 
for the importance of diet and antidiabetic treatment compliance throughout the study; any 
change in symptoms or home glucose monitoring results should be reviewed at each scheduled 
visit and the patient encouraged to follow up as required with the physician managing the 
patient’s diabetes.  The physician managing the patient’s diabetes should be informed that the 
patient is on or has recently started on prednisone therapy.  Changes in diabetic medication 
should be supervised by or be based on consultation with the physician managing the patient’s 
diabetes.  

At baseline, if the HbA1c is > 7%, the patient should be referred for further assessment to 
ensure adequate or improved diabetes control while on study.  During the study treatment, if 
there is an increase in HgbA1c of 1.5 % above baseline or to > 8.0%, the patient should be 
referred to the physician managing the patient’s diabetes for additional management support.  
The management of hyperglycemia or diabetes should be addressed before considering study 
drug or prednisone dose reduction or hold.  

Worsening of diabetic control is often associated with acute or chronic infection, other acute 
illness, new medication (diuretics or beta blockers), or electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia).  

Confidential

dosing for coverage of physiologic stress 
if indicated.  Monitor patient for signs 
and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency if 
no corticosteroid administered.  Resume

15.6.6    Renal Disorders

Acute renal injury is defined as a disorder characterized by the acute loss of renal function and 
is traditionally classified as prerenal (low blood flow into kidney), renal (kidney damage), and 
postrenal causes (ureteral or bladder outflow obstruction).  The toxicity grade of acute renal 
injury will be assessed based on the serum creatinine level.  Other clinical signs and symptoms, 
including proteinuria and hematuria, as detected by qualitative or quantitative laboratory test 
results, may be monitored in addition to creatinine value.  

In studies of patients with advanced prostate cancer, the incidence of worsening renal function is 
relatively common and largely associated with worsening or exacerbation of urinary outflow 
obstruction.  In addition, new use of diuretics or other precipitants of volume depletion 
commonly results in prerenal azotemia.  

Table 15-13 summarizes the CTCAE Criteria (version 4.02)(77) for acute renal disorder and the 
appropriate actions to be followed.

study drug for 2 weeks.  Resume at dose level 
reduced by 1 once creatinine is ≤ 2  baseline.  If 
the event recurs, reduce dose by 1 additional level 
and reassess.   Final dose should be no higher 
than 1 level below starting dose.  
Hold study drug until the patient is discharged 
from the hospital and creatinine level has 
recovered to  < 2  baseline and resume at one 
reduced level, then follow Grade 2 guidelines.

15.6.7    Suspected or Possible Adrenal Insufficiency

If patients experience adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal insufficiency will have the more 
nonspecific manifestations of glucocorticoid insufficiency, rather than the more specific 
electrolyte abnormalities of mineralocorticoid insufficiency.  Discontinuing prednisone and 
continuing study drug while on study may lead to the symptoms of chronic or acute adrenal 
(glucocorticoid) insufficiency.  Patients experiencing severe physiological stress (eg, surgery, 
severe infection) should be carefully monitored for adrenal insufficiency.  Concomitant 
medications may complicate the picture of adrenal insufficiency, in particular in patients who 
are on beta-blockers or diuretics.  Concomitant illness such as infection might similarly trigger 
or worsen symptoms of otherwise mild adrenal insufficiency.  

Grading of adrenal insufficiency, the clinical manifestations associated with the specific grade, 
and suggested management options are provided in Table 15-14.  In all cases, ‘actions’ should 
include a thorough review for other possible causes or contributors to the presenting symptoms 
(eg, infection, anemia, or newly introduced concomitant medications).

Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

15.7   Amendment 1 Rationale and Purposes

Rationale for Amendment 1 (global amendment relative to the original protocol)
The primary purpose of this amendment is to refine the eligibility criteria.  The amendment also 
clarifies specific study procedures, updates the safety information for orteronel, adds the 
collection of information on rashes, and clarifies disease assessment guidelines.  
The eligibility criteria have been refined to reduce the washout period of prior bicalutamide 
treatment from 6 weeks to 4 weeks, which will be sufficient for elimination removal of most of 
the drug.  Prior therapy with other therapies for prostate cancer, other than gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, such as progesterone, medroxyprogesterone, progestins 
(megesterol), or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride or dutasteride) must be 
discontinued 2 weeks before first dose of study drug.  Patients with disease localized to the 
prostate or adjacent tissue are excluded, ie patients must have regional or distant metastases.
The analysis of circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration response has been changed from 24 
weeks to 12 weeks.  The 24-week results might have a slightly higher predictive value for 
overall survival than the 12-week results.  However, the attrition rate of patients at 24 weeks 
may be higher than at 12 weeks based on data from the TAK-700_201 study.  Taken together, 
these findings suggest that analysis of the 12-week samples as a key secondary endpoint would 
be more robust than the 24-week samples due to the number of patients included in the sample 
population.
Some study samples have been clarified, refined, or expanded.  The serologic testing for patients 
who are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C and have 
not been previously tested may be done at screening.  The serologic testing will be done at a 
local laboratory.  The number and timing of the pharmacokinetic (PK) samples have been 
expanded so that data are collected at sufficient sparse time points to permit population PK 
modeling.
The rationale, collection, and labeling of samples for the germline and tumor DNA analyses 
have been refined to ensure that investigators and patients understand which assessments are 
optional and that the samples will be labeled and handled according to regional and local 
regulations with removal of patient identifiers from these samples.  
The disease assessments for this study are based on the guidelines from the Prostate Cancer 
Working Group (PCWG2) that incorporate evaluation of soft tissue lesions according to the 
Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.  The assessment guidelines provided 
in the protocol have been revised for clarity.  Other clarifications in procedures are summarized 
below.  
Purposes for Amendment 1 (global amendment relative to the original protocol)
The purposes of this amendment are to:

15.8    Amendment 2 Rationale and Purposes

Rationale for Amendment 2 (Peru-specific amendment relative to global amendment 1)
The primary purpose of this amendment is to revise the study design including eligibility criteria 
and conduct based on recommendations made by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS).  
The guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) state that 
sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) is considered a category-1 drug for patients with asymptomatic 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with no visceral compromise.  
Additionally, according to the International Council on Harmonization guidelines, possible 
benefits, risks, costs, and efficacy of every new intervention must be evaluated through their 
comparison with the best existing proven intervention, as well as with its exceptions.  As a 
result, the study design and conduct were revised to allow asymptomatic patients with no 
visceral compromise sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) treatment when the product becomes available 
on the Peruvian market.  The sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) therapy regime has been specified for 
eligible patients.
The NCCN treatment algorithm for patients with mCRPC also indicates that cases where 
patients are without symptoms, but have documented visceral compromise undergo 
chemotherapy.  Thus, asymptomatic patients with radiographically documented metastatic 
disease will be excluded.
Purposes for Amendment 2 (Peru-specific amendment relative to global amendment 1)
The purposes of this amendment are to:

 Revise the study design and conduct to allow patients sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) 

treatment when the product becomes available on the Peruvian market and specify the 
sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) therapy regime for eligible patients

 Modify eligibility criteria to exclude patients with radiographically documented 

visceral compromise

 Correct typographical errors, punctuation, grammar, and formatting

15.9    Amendment 3 Rationale and Purposes

Rationale for Amendment 3 (relative to global amendment 1)
The primary purpose of this amendment is to increase the period of contraception to be followed 
by patients after the last dose of study drug from 30 days to 4 months.  The extension of the 
contraception period is a precaution based on in vitro results of genotoxicity testing of a 
degradant in the TAK-700 tablet.  Although the degradant was negative for mutagenic structural 
alerts in the in silico assessments, the degradant tested positive for mutagenicity in 1 of 5 
bacterial strains tested in the Ames assay, and it induced structural and numerical chromosomal 
aberrations in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay.  The potential clinical implications of 
these in vitro assay results are that any resulting genetic or chromosomal change could 
potentially lead to secondary tumors and may pose a risk to an unborn child.  
Given the potential benefit of TAK-700 to patients with progressive castrate resistant prostate 

Confidential

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

cancer (CRPC) for whom alternative treatments and life expectancy are limited, the anticipated 
risk of the degradant is considered to be low.  To minimize potential risks to an unborn child, 
the requirement for the use of barrier contraception or abstention from heterosexual intercourse 
has been extended to 4 months after the last dose of study drug.  The risk language for the study 
drug was updated to include the reference to potential clinical implications of the possible 
genotoxic degradant in the drug product.
Purposes for Amendment 3
The purposes of this amendment are to:

 Remove reference to the 1-hour time window for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 

(DHEA-S), testosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and 
corticosterone sample collection

 Clarify the definition of radiographic disease progression based on radionuclide bone 

scans

 Update risk language for the study drug to include potential clinical implications of a 

degradant in the tablet

 Extend the duration of contraception or abstention from heterosexual intercourse to 

4 months after the last dose of study drug

 Clarify that dose modifications are required  for Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) or 

intolerable Grade 2 AEs that are considered at least possibly related to study drug

 Correct typographical errors, punctuation, grammar, and formatting

15.10   

Amendment 4 Rationale and Purposes

Rationale for Amendment 4
(Peru-specific protocol amendment 4 is written relative to the Peru-specific protocol 
amendment 2 and incorporates changes in global protocol amendments 1 and 3.)
The primary purpose of this amendment is to refine the eligibility criteria and increase the 
period of contraception.  The amendment also clarifies specific study procedures, updates the 
safety information for orteronel, adds the collection of information on rashes, and clarifies 
disease assessment guidelines.
The period of contraception to be followed by patients after the last dose of study drug was 
increased from 30 days to 4 months.  The extension of the contraception period is a precaution 
based on in vitro results of genotoxicity testing of a degradant in the TAK-700 tablet.  Although 
the degradant was negative for mutagenic structural alerts in the in silico assessments, the 
degradant tested positive for mutagenicity in 1 of 5 bacterial strains tested in the Ames assay,

aberration assay.  The potential clinical implications of these in vitro assay results are that any 
resulting genetic or chromosomal change could potentially lead to secondary tumors and may 
pose a risk to an unborn child.

Amendment 6 Rationale and Purposes

Rationale for Amendment 6 (relative to global amendment 3)
The primary purpose of this amendment is to add an additional interim analysis for overall 
survival to take place when approximately 450 deaths have occurred.
After the interim analyses take place, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) may 
recommend that the study be unblinded.  Therefore, the protocol is being modified to reflect 
changes in procedures if unblinding occurs.  Prior to unblinding, patients will follow all 
procedures as outlined in Amendment 3, as specified in the Schedule of Events #1 (Patients in 
the Blinded Study).  After unblinding, however, patients who are actively on study and who are 
receiving placebo will be offered the opportunity to cross over to active treatment with 
orteronel.  Those treatment-naïve patients will undergo procedures outlined in the Schedule of 
Events #2 (Patients Crossing From Placebo to Orteronel After Unblinding).  Patients who had 
received active study drug and who elect to continue to receive orteronel at the time of 
unblinding will undergo study procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Events #3 (Patients 
Continuing to Receive Orteronel After Unblinding).  Portions of the study that are no longer 
relevant or needed after unblinding (eg, short-term follow-up, collection of samples for 
measurement of circulating tumor cells [CTCs] and plasma orteronel concentrations, 
pharmacokinetic [PK] sampling, imaging studies, etc) are being removed from the Schedules of 
Events, and the protocol text is being amended to reflect data that will no longer be collected.  
Specific safety language is being updated to be consistent with current safety information and 
standard language used in the sponsor's protocols.
Instructions are being added to ensure that patients receiving placebo must meet certain 
eligibility criteria to crossover to active treatment with orteronel.
Details on study conduct are being updated to clarify acceptable methods of contraception and 
to provide a clear definition of abstinence from heterosexual intercourse.  Guidance on 
contraception or abstention from heterosexual intercourse is being updated.  In addition, the 

Confidential

allowable reasons for withdrawal of patients from the study are being updated.
Information on supply, labeling, and storage of study drug are being updated.
The methods for recording, reporting, and monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) are being updated to be consistent with current procedures.

Purposes for Amendment 6
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Analysis

 Add an interim analysis to occur when approximately 450 deaths have occurred
 Update threshold p-values in the statistical analysis

Procedures

 Update the Study Flow Diagram to reflect the change in study procedures after 

unblinding

 Create 2 Schedules of Events at the time of unblinding:  1 for patients crossing over 

from placebo to orteronel and 1 for patients continuing to receive orteronel

 Remove the following study procedures for patients in the unblinded study, because 

sufficient data will have been collected before study unblinding, and limited inference 
can be made following crossover of all patients to active study drug:

o PK sampling
o Collection of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 

Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Module 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) data

o Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans 

(however, scans may be performed by sites at the discretion of the investigator 
based on clinical need)

o Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans (however, scans may be 

performed by sites at the discretion of the investigator based on clinical need)

o Collection of samples for the enumeration of CTCs
o Collection of samples for bone biochemical markers
o Collection of samples for germline DNA analysis
o Evaluation of medical resource utilization (MRU)
o Assessment of cost of treatment in each arm

 Clarify that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results will not be withheld from the sponsor 

after study unblinding

 Remove recording of complete medical histories after study unblinding, because this 

information will have already been collected from patients in the blinded study

 Remove recording of height after study unblinding, because this information will have

already been collected from patients in the blinded study

 Clarify that informed consent will be collected from all patients at the time of study 

unblinding

 Update language on utility measurement, stating that this data will be continually 

collected until the patient discontinues study drug

 Add language indicating that the short-term follow-up portion of the study will no longer 

apply to patients at the time of unblinding

Eligibility

 Add inclusion criteria for patients crossing over from placebo to orteronel treatment
 Clarify that disease progression is not required for patients crossing over from placebo to 

orteronel

 Clarify acceptable methods of contraception, and provide a clear definition of abstinence 

from heterosexual intercourse

 Clarify the allowable reasons for discontinuation of treatment with study drug
 Clarify the allowable reasons for withdrawal of patients from the study
 Update language concerning long-term survival status to clarify that End of Treatment 

(EOT) indicates “every 3 months (± 30 days from the last dose of study drug)”

 Remove instructions on emergency unblinding procedures as they no longer apply after 

study unblinding

Amendment 7 Rationale and Purposes

Rationale for Amendment 7 
(Peru-specific protocol amendment 7 is written relative to the Peru-specific protocol 
amendment 4 and incorporates changes in global protocol amendment 6)
The primary purpose of this amendment is to add an additional interim analysis for overall 
survival to take place when approximately 450 deaths have occurred.
After the interim analyses take place, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) may 
recommend that the study be unblinded.  Therefore, the protocol is being modified to reflect 
changes in procedures if unblinding occurs.  Prior to unblinding, patients will follow all 
procedures as outlined in Amendment 4, as specified in the Schedule of Events #1 (Patients in 
the Blinded Study).  After unblinding, however, patients who are actively on study and who are 
receiving placebo will be offered the opportunity to cross over to active treatment with 
orteronel.  Those treatment-naïve patients will undergo procedures outlined in the Schedule of 
Events #2 (Patients Crossing From Placebo to Orteronel After Unblinding).  Patients who had 
received active study drug and who elect to continue to receive orteronel at the time of 
unblinding will undergo study procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Events #3 (Patients 
Continuing to Receive Orteronel After Unblinding).  Portions of the study that are no longer 
relevant or needed after unblinding (eg, short-term follow-up, collection of samples for 
measurement of circulating tumor cells [CTCs] and plasma orteronel concentrations, 
pharmacokinetic [PK] sampling, imaging studies, etc) are being removed from the Schedules of 
Events, and the protocol text is being amended to reflect data that will no longer be collected.

Amendment 9 Detailed Summary of Changes

THE PRIMARY SECTION(S) OF THE PROTOCOL AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES IN 
AMENDMENT 9 ARE INDICATED.  THE CORRESPONDING TEXT HAS BEEN REVISED 
THROUGHOUT THE PROTOCOL.

Purpose:  Remove the second interim analysis for OS (when approximately 450 [50%] deaths 
have occurred) and change the final analysis to occur after approximately 600 deaths

The primary change occurs in Section 8.1.6.2, Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoints:

Formerly 
read:

There will be 3 interim analyses for OS.  The first analysis of OS will occur at the 
rPFS analysis, the second OS analysis will occur when approximately 50% of the 
expected deaths (450) have occurred, and the third OS analysis will occur when 
approximately two thirds of the expected deaths (600) have occurred.  A detailed 
description of the interim analyses can be found in Section 8.1.9.

Now 
reads:

There will be 1 interim analysis for OS, which will occur at the final rPFS analysis
when approximately 412 radiographic disease progression events have been 
observed.  A detailed description of the interim analysis can be found in Section 
8.1.9.  The final analysis for OS will occur after approximately 600 deaths have 
occurred.

Sections that also contain this change are:

 Section 4.1, Overview of Study Design and Conduct
 Section 8.1.1, Determination of Sample Size
 Section 8.1.9, Interim Analyses
 Section 9.1, Independent Data Monitoring Committee

Purpose:  Clarify that the only interim analysis for OS occurred at the final rPFS analysis when 
approximately 412 radiographic disease progression events had been observed

The primary change occurs in Section 8.1.9, Interim Analyses

Formerly 
read:

The first interim analysis will be performed when approximately 412 radiographic 
disease progression events have occurred, which is estimated to be 15 months after 
the first patient is enrolled.  This is the final analysis for rPFS, with the opportunity 
to claim rPFS benefit at a significance level of 0.005.  The magnitude of the rPFS 
will continue to be assessed as more data become available; no further p-value will 
be calculated.  An analysis of OS will be conducted simultaneously based on OS 
data available at the time of rPFS analysis.  The test significance of OS at this 
analysis will be determined by O’Brien and Fleming boundaries and the number of 
deaths observed.(85)  It is anticipated that approximately 152 deaths will have 
occurred by the time of the first interim analysis.  Based on this projected number 
of deaths, the alpha spent at this analysis for OS will be less than 0.00001.

Clinical Study Protocol C21004 Amendment 9

The second interim analysis is planned when approximately 450, or 50% of total 
deaths required for the OS endpoint have occurred.  The interim analysis will be 
conducted at a significance level according to O’Brien and Fleming boundaries.  
The statistical stopping boundary at this interim analysis will be calculated on the 
basis of the actual number of deaths observed.  If rPFS is significant at the interim 
analysis, the overall significance for OS will be 0.05.  In this case, the trial will be 
stopped for overwhelming efficacy if the observed p value is less than or equal to 
0.0031 based on exactly half of the total deaths observed.  The trial would be 
stopped for futility if the observed p value is greater than or equal to 0.8449.  On 
the other hand, if rPFS is not significant at the interim analysis, the overall 
significance for OS will be 0.045.  In this case, the trial will be stopped for 
overwhelming efficacy if the observed p value is less than or equal to 0.0025 based 
on exactly half of the total deaths observed.  The trial would be stopped for futility 
if the observed p value is greater than or equal to 0.8217.
The third interim analysis is planned when approximately 600, or 67% of total 
deaths required for the OS endpoint have occurred.  The interim analysis will be 
conducted at a significance level according to O’Brien and Fleming boundaries.  
The statistical stopping boundary at this interim analysis will be calculated on the 
basis of the actual number of deaths observed.  If rPFS is significant at the interim 
analysis, the overall significance for OS will be 0.05.  In this case, the trial will be 
stopped for overwhelming efficacy if the observed p value is less than or equal to 
0.0112 based on exactly two thirds of the total deaths observed.  The trial would be 
stopped for futility if the observed p value is greater than or equal to 0.4341.  On 
the other hand, if rPFS is not significant at the interim analysis, the overall 
significance for OS will be 0.045.  In this case, the trial will be stopped for 
overwhelming efficacy if the observed p value is less than or equal to 0.0096 based 
on exactly two thirds of the total deaths observed.  The trial would be stopped for 
futility if the observed p value is greater than or equal to 0.4041.

The interim analysis will be performed when approximately 412 radiographic 
disease progression events have occurred, which is estimated to be 15 months after 
the first patient is enrolled.  This is the final analysis for rPFS, with the opportunity 
to claim rPFS benefit at a significance level of 0.005.  The magnitude of the rPFS 
will continue to be assessed as more data become available; no further p-value will 
be calculated.  An analysis of OS will be conducted simultaneously based on OS 
data available at the time of rPFS analysis.  The test significance of OS at this 
analysis will be determined by O’Brien and Fleming boundaries and the number of 
deaths observed.(85)  It is anticipated that approximately 152 deaths will have 
occurred by the time of the interim analysis.  Based on this projected number of 
deaths, the alpha spent at this analysis for OS will be less than 0.00001.

patients receiving placebo may be allowed to cross over to orteronel treatment.

Additional sections that reflect this change are:

 Section 6.8, Blinding and Unblinding
 Section 7.4, Study Procedures

Purpose:  Clarify the End of Treatment (EOT) visit window in the Schedule of Events

The primary change occurs in Schedule of Events #1, Cycles for Patients in the Blinded Portion 
of the Study (footnote f):

Formerly 
read:

f  The EOT visit will be conducted 30 days (+ 10 days) after the last dose of study 
drug.  If subsequent antineoplastic therapy is required prior to 30 days after the 
last dose, the EOT visit should be conducted prior to the initiation of the 
subsequent antineoplastic therapy.

Now 
reads:

f  The EOT visit will be conducted 30 days (+ 10 days) after study drug 

discontinuation or sooner if subsequent antineoplastic therapy is anticipated to 
initiate before 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  The EOT visit should 
be conducted prior to the initiation of the subsequent antineoplastic therapy.

This change is also reflected in:

 Schedule of Events #2, Cycles for Patients Crossing From Placebo to Orteronel After 

Unblinding (new footnote f inserted)

 Schedule of Events #3, Cycles for Patients Continuing to Receive Orteronel After 

Unblinding (new footnote e inserted)

Purpose:  Clarify that the criteria outlined in Section 5.3 (Criteria for Patients Crossing Over to 
Orteronel Treatment) will only apply in the event that patients receiving placebo are offered 
orteronel treatment when the study is unblinded

The primary change occurs in Section 5.3, Criteria for Patients Crossing Over to Orteronel 
Treatment:

Formerly 
read:

Patients who are crossing over from placebo to orteronel treatment must meet all 
the criteria listed below. Completion of a second Patient Eligibility Checklist is not
