PROTOCOL OUTLINE 
Study number 
Study name 
Title 
A randomized, open-label, phase III study of RPR109881 IV every 3 weeks versus capecitabine 
(Xeloda®) tablets twice daily for 2 weeks in 3-week cycles in patients with metastatic breast 
cancer progressing after taxanes and anthracycline therapy 
 
Investigators, study sites 
Approximately 250 sites worldwide: 100 North America/Latin America, 150 Europe and 
Australia 
 
Estimated study 
duration and 
dates 

First Patient Treated: Apr 2004 
Last patient in July 2005  
Primary Analysis Event (PFS): Oct 2005(20 months)  
Last Patient Treatment Visit: May 2006 (27 months) 
Survival Analysis: Nov 2007 (45 months)  

Phase 

III 

Objectives 
Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare progression free survival 
(PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with RPR109881 versus capecitabine 
progressing after taxanes and anthracycline therapy. 

Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to compare survival and other measures of 
anti-tumor efficacy [response rate (RR), time to tumor response (TTR), duration of response 
(DR), single time progression rate (STPR), and time to treatment failure (TTF)] in patients treated 
with RPR109881 versus capecitabine; to compare the safety and tolerability of RPR109881 
versus capecitabine; and to compare the quality of life and other clinical benefit measures in 
patients treated with RPR109881 versus capecitabine. 
 
Study design 
This will be a global multi-center, open-label, two-arm randomized, phase III clinical trial. 
Patients will be randomized to treatment with RPR109881 (test arm) or capecitabine (comparator 
arm). Patients will be stratified based on the treatment setting of prior taxane administration, prior 
taxane responsiveness, and region. Patients will continue to receive treatment until disease 
progression, patient intolerance, or withdrawal of consent. Patients who discontinue study 
treatment prior to disease progression will continue to have tumor assessments every 6 weeks 
until disease progression.  Following disease progression, patients will be treated by their 
physicians as determined by usual medical practice and followed for survival. Patients treated on 
the capecitabine arm will not be eligible to receive RPR109881 in this or other clinical trials for 
breast cancer.

Final 

Radiological tumor assessments will be performed at baseline, at the end of every even-numbered 
treatment cycle (every 6 weeks), and whenever disease progression is suspected. In addition, a 
radiological tumor assessment to obtain a single time progression rate (STPR) will be obtained at 
Day 120 (+/- 7 days) for all patients. After the patient is withdrawn from study treatment, a final 
tumor assessment will be performed if an assessment has not been performed within the prior 6 
weeks. All patients with an objective response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) 
must have the response confirmed between 4-6 weeks after the initial documentation of response. 
All scans will be independently reviewed in real-time to assess for response to treatment (PR or 
CR) and disease progression by an independent review committee (IRC). An independent data 
monitoring committee (IDMC) will review the data during the conduct of the trial. 
 
Number of patients 
Approximately 800 patients, 400 patients randomized to the RPR109881 treatment arm and 400 
patients to the capecitabine treatment arm, are required to reach a total number of 617 
progressions in order to provide 90% power to detect a 23% reduction in the hazard rates for the 
primary analysis of TTP. If the target number of events is attained prior to fully accruing patients 
to the study, the trial will be closed to further enrollment. 
 
Inclusion eligibility criteria 
Inclusion Criteria - Patients meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for 
enrollment into the study: 
1.  Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of breast adenocarcinoma that is now 

metastatic or locally recurrent and inoperable with curative intent. Patients with previously 
treated histo/cytologically confirmed disease who develop clinical or radiological evidence of 
metastatic disease do not require separate confirmation of the metastatic disease.   

2.  All patients must have received an anthracycline and a taxane (e.g. docetaxel and/or 

paclitaxel) prior to entry in the protocol. These drugs may have been given in the 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant or in the metastatic setting, may have been given concurrently or 
sequentially, and may have been given in combination with other drugs. Patients must have 
received a standard dose of anthracycline and of taxane expected to have potentially resulted 
in a response. 

For taxanes 

a)  Patients must have progressed while receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel therapy or at any 

time after having received paclitaxel or docetaxel therapy. 

b)  The taxane-based treatment must have been the last chemotherapy the patient received.

Final 

For anthracyclines 

Patients must have either: 

a)  Progressed while on anthracycline treatment, with or without an initial response  

OR 

b)  Patients must have received an adequate course of anthracyclines defined as follows: 

i. 

In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, patients must have received a regimen 
considered standard for adjuvant therapy, which would usually result in a 
cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 200-300 mg/m2 or doxorubicin equivalent. 

ii.  In the metastatic setting patients must have received a regimen considered standard 
for therapy for metastatic disease, which would usually result in a cumulative dose 
of doxorubicin of at least 300 mg/m2 or doxorubicin equivalent. 

3.  Completion of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy (including trastuzumab [Herceptin]), 

targeted non-cytotoxic therapy, and radiotherapy ≥3 weeks prior to randomization. Prior 
treatment with radiotherapy, chemoembolization therapy, or cryotherapy is allowed if these 
therapies are not directed to the areas of measurable disease being used for the purposes of 
this protocol. Patients on bisphosphonate therapy may continue such therapy. 

4.  Evidence of measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 

(RECIST). Measurable lesions are lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension with longest diameter ≥ 20 mm with conventional CT.  With spiral CT scan, lesion 
must be ≥ 10 mm in at least one dimension. 
5.  Male or female patients at least 18 years old. 
6.  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0,1, or 2. 
7.  Patients must have resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of 
any prior surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, chemoembolization therapy, hormone therapy, 
immunotherapy, targeted non-cytotoxic therapy, or chemotherapy to grade ≤1 by National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 
3.0, or to within the limits listed in the specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.

squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri. Inclusion of patients with 
any other in situ cancer or a history of an invasive cancer with complete remission for 5 or 
more years must be discussed with the sponsor and the principal investigators. Patients with a 
history of contralateral breast cancer who have been disease-free for more than 5 years prior to 
randomization are permitted. 

2.  History of hypersensitivity grade ≥3 to taxanes, Polysorbate-80, or to compounds with similar 

chemical structures. Patients with known intolerance to fluoropyrimidines or patients with 
known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. 

3.  The following breast cancer treatments: 

•  Patients receiving >1 adjuvant regimen. However, patients who have received neoadjuvant 

therapy immediately followed by surgery and immediately followed by adjuvant therapy 
without intervening progression are considered to have received one adjuvant regimen and 
are allowed in the trial. It is not considered to be adjuvant treatment, when chemotherapy 
is administered after a local treatment by either surgery or radiotherapy of a single 
metastasis, including cutaneous metastases, since recurrence is a near certainty and not 
only a risk. 

•  Patients receiving >1 chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or locally recurrent and 

inoperable breast cancer. A chemotherapy regimen is defined as a single or a combination 
of chemotherapy agents given until documented disease progression or relapse. For 
example, patients who received sequential doxorubicin and docetaxel in the metastatic 
setting without intervening progression are allowed in the trial. 

4.  Prior treatment with capecitabine or any taxane-analogs except for paclitaxel or docetaxel (eg, 

epothilones are not permitted, novel preparations of paclitaxel are not permitted). Generic 
paclitaxel and Abraxane® (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) are permitted. 

5.  Concurrent treatment with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, erythromycin, clarythromycin or patients planning to receive these treatments. 
For patients who were receiving treatment with such agents, a one-week washout period is 
required prior to randomization. 

6.  Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial or with any other cancer therapy including 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy (including trastuzumab [Herceptin]), hormonal therapy, 
radiotherapy, chemoembolization therapy, cryotherapy, targeted non-cytotoxic therapies or 
patients planning to receive these treatments during the study. 

7.  HER-2 positive patients may participate in this trial. Concurrent treatment with trastuzumab 

[Herceptin] is not permitted. 

8.  Known brain or leptomeningeal disease (CT or MRI scan of the brain required only in case of 

clinical suspicion of central nervous system involvement).

9.  Any of the following within the 6 months prior to randomization: myocardial infarction, 

severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft surgery, clinically 
symptomatic and uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, or clinically significant cardiac 
arrhythmias (grade 3-4). 

10. History of inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea. 
11. Peripheral neuropathy grade ≥2. 
12. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or significant laboratory 

abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for the patient’s safety, 
inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with interpretation of study results, and in the 
judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. 

13. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection requiring treatment or acquired 

immunodeficiency-syndrome (AIDS)-related illness. 

14. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
 
Treatments 
RPR109881: Patients randomized to the RPR109881 treatment arm will receive a starting dose of 
90 mg/m² IV RPR109881 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 administered over 1-hour, with the exception of 
patients with known bone marrow involvement, documented by bone marrow biopsy and/or 
aspiration, who will receive a starting dose of 75 mg/m² IV RPR109881. Treatments will be 
repeated in the same manner at 3-week intervals (3-week cycles). Dose adjustment will be 
permitted for subsequent treatment cycles based on individual patient tolerance. 

Required premedication will include: dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg, diphenhydramine 25 mg or 
other antihistamines; dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent steroid. Ranitidine or other Histamine H2 
antagonist is recommended with the exception of cimetidine. All premedications will be 
administered by i.v. infusion.  It is recommended that infusion of these medications be completed 
30 minutes or more prior to each dose of RPR109881. Anti-emetic prophylaxis with ondansetron, 
granisetron or dolasetron is recommended. 

Capecitabine: Patients randomized to the capecitabine treatment arm will receive a starting dose 
of 1250 mg/m² capecitabine tablets administered orally twice daily (morning and evening, 
equivalent to 2500 mg/m2 total daily dose) for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, to form 
a 3-week cycle. The dose is based on prescribing information stated in the US and EU package 
inserts. Dose adjustment will be permitted depending on individual patient tolerance. 
Capecitabine tablets should be swallowed with water within 30 minutes after a meal. 
 
Efficacy data 
The IRC (Independent Review Committee) will review the tumor assessments provided by 
investigators independently in a blinded fashion. The IRC will provide final assessment for 
responses (CR and PR), best response, date of first response, assessment of tumor progression, 
and the date of progression for each patient. The operational details of the review process will be 
provided in the IRC Charter.

Final 

Primary Efficacy Variable:  Progression Free Survival (PFS) will be determined by the 
Independent Review Committee (IRC) and defined as the time from randomization to first 
documentation of objective tumor progression, according to RECIST, or death. 

Secondary Efficacy Variables: 
•  Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death. 
•  Single Time Progression Rate (STPR) defined as the proportion of patients with objective 

disease progression defined by RECIST by Day 120 of treatment, or death, relative to the total 
number patients in the analysis population. 

•  Response Rate (RR) defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response 
(CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), defined by RECIST, relative to the total number of 
patients in the analysis population. 

Other Efficacy Variables: 
•  Time to Tumor Response (TTR) defined as the time from randomization to the first 

documentation of objective tumor response defined by RECIST. 

•  Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), defined as the time from randomization to the first 

documentation of objective tumor progression defined by RECIST, or final discontinuation of 
all study treatment, or death, whichever comes first. 

•  Duration of Response (DR) defined as the time from the first documentation of objective 

tumor response defined by RECIST to the first documentation of objective tumor progression 
defined by RECIST or death. 

 
Quality of life data / Clinical benefit parameters 
•  Quality of life as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire with QLQ-BR23 breast 

cancer symptom module. 

•  The Global health status/QoL score of the QLQ-C30 will be the primary QoL endpoint. The 

Breast/arm symptom scores of QLQ-BR23 will be supportive. 
•  Change in body weight and performance status from baseline. 
 
Safety data 
Safety analyses will be performed based on incidence, severity (as graded by the NCI CTCAE, 
version 3.0), chronicity, and cumulative nature of treatment- emergent adverse events. 
 
Health economic data 
Health resource utilization and EQ-5D questionnaire data will be collected in applicable countries 
to determine the health economic impact of RPR109881. These data will be collected in order to 
perform an analysis by country, if necessary. Heath economic data collection and analysis will be 
considered an adjunct study.

Statistical procedures 
Three analysis populations will be defined for this study: 
•  The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized patients. The treatment 

code of the each patient in the ITT population is determined by the treatment code originally 
assigned by randomization. 
This population is the primary efficacy analysis population and will be used in the analyses of 
all efficacy variables. 

•  The As-Treated (AT) population will consist of all patients who receive at least 1 partial dose 
of study drug. The treatment code of each patient in the as-treated population is determined by 
the treatment the subject actually received. 
This population will be evaluated for safety as well as for demographic and background 
information. 

•  The Evaluable Patient (EP) population will consist of all randomized patients who have 

measurable disease of breast cancer based on RECIST criteria, have baseline and at least one 
post-baseline valid tumor assessment (including symptomatic deterioration defined by 
RECIST), and also satisfy one of the following two conditions: 
−  Received at least 2 cycles of treatment at the intended dose. 
−  Received less than 2 cycles of treatment at the intended dose but has evidence of disease 

progression or has withdrawn from study treatment due to unacceptable study drug-related 
toxicity. 

The treatment code of each subject in the Evaluable population is determined by the treatment 
the subject actually received. 

This population is the secondary efficacy analysis population and will be used in the analyses 
of the primary and selected secondary efficacy variables. 

Statistical Methods:  Progression free survival (PFS) will be analyzed when total 617 
progressions determined by IRC are observed. The  PFS will be compared between the two 
treatment groups using a log rank test stratified by the randomization factors “treatment setting of 
prior taxanes administration” and “prior taxane responsiveness” as specified at the time of 
randomization. The rates of  PFS events will also be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The analyses will be performed on the ITT population and as a secondary analysis, on the EP 
population. 

A futility analysis of RR will be performed by the IDMC after the first 200 patients have been  
randomized, with a minimum of two tumor assessments, died or progressed.  The futility analysis 
will consist of an evaluation of the objective response rate and safety data between the treatment 
arms for a consideration of a possible early termination for lack of efficacy or unacceptable 
safety. The IDMC will make a recommendation to the sponsor based on the results and the 
sponsor will evaluate the suggestions of the IDMC prior to making a final decision regarding 
continuation of the study.

Overall survival (OS) will be analyzed when total 618 deaths are observed. Time-to-death will be 
compared between the two treatments by the log-rank test procedure stratified by the 
randomization factors. The survival curves will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The 
analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 

An interim analysis of OS is planned at the time when the targeted number progressions are 
observed for the primary efficacy analysis. The nominal alpha values used for the interim analysis 
and final analysis will be determined by the “group sequential” approach (Lan KKG and DeMets 
DL, 1983) with a Gamma (-7) spending function (Hwang, IK, Shih, WJ, and DeCani, JJ, 1990).

Study Cut-Off / Closure 
Based on the results from scheduled futility analysis and further confirmatory analysis that were 
performed respectively in December 2005 and April 2006, the IDMC for the trial recommended 
that the study be closed for randomization.  The IDMC concluded that the safety profile of the 
study was acceptable for both arms. However, the protocol assumptions for efficacy were not met.  

Randomization for the study was stopped in January 2006. A total of 438 patients were enrolled. 
Patients who were still on active treatment were offered by their physicians to either continue to 
be treated with study drugs until protocol defined discontinuation were met or to be treated as per 
standard medical practice.

Final 

Currently, there are 21 patients that are still on active treatment. The sponsor will continue to 
provide study drugs or appropriate reimbursement (for comparator drug) for those patients that are 
still receiving and benifitting from treatment on study.  

The study cut-off date was designated to be September 15th, 2006. After this date, patients still 
receiving treatment may remain on their assigned treatment using Sponsor-supplied study 
medication -XRP9881or commercially available capecitabine - (with Sponsor reimbursement) 
until one of the protocol-defined criteria for discontinuation of study treatment is met. 

CRFs will be collected for all treatment cycles completed on or before the September 15th, 
2006 cut-off date as well as for all follow-up visits completed prior to the database lock 
(estimated for 27th Oct 2006). 

CRFs will not be collected for any treatment cycles completed after the study cut-off date.   

However, for all patients that remain on active treatment after the cut-off date, serious adverse 
events (SAEs) occurring either while on active treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of 
active treatment should be reported to sanofi-aventis via the same method as during the study. 
Furthermore, any SAE considered (to have a reasonable possibility of being) related to study 
treatment should be reported to sanofi-aventis regardless of when it occurs.

*  Assessment must be performed prior to randomization rather than prior to initial dose for eligibility determination. 
1. 

Study Days: All assessments should be performed prior to dosing with study drug unless otherwise indicated. Acceptable time windows for 
performing the assessments are noted below each scheduled treatment day in the Study Schedule Table, unless otherwise noted in the 
footnotes below.  

Footnotes for Study Schedule 

2.  Day 1: Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day 1 of the study) refers to the day the patient receives the initial dose of study medication. The Cycle 1 Day 1 

Assessments noted in the Study Schedule are not required if acceptable screening for the assessment is performed within 5 days prior to 
the start of treatment with study drug. However, all of these assessments must be performed for subsequent cycles (eg, Cycle 2 Day 1, 
Cycle 3 Day 1, etc.) on Day 1 [-1/+0] and on Day 1 [-3/+0] for blood chemistry. Day 1 of each subsequent cycle is defined by the date that 
study drug administration is started within that cycle. Therefore, the assessment time windows (indicated in Footnote 1) for Day 1 are 
always relative to the date that study drug administration is started. Patients must be seen by the responsible physician on Day 1 of each 
cycle.  

3.  Medical & Oncologic History: including: diagnosis; prior surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, concurrent illness; history of allergy. 
4.  Coagulation: PT/ INR, and PTT. 
5.  Hematology: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC with differential count, platelet count. If grade 4 neutropenia, assess ANC every 3 days [-1/+0] 

until ANC ≥1,500/µL. In case of grade 1 fever, CBC should be performed. 

6.  Blood Chemistry: Sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, BUN, creatinine, albumin, total protein, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total 

bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose. For patients with extensive liver involvement, a marked increase in liver function test results 
warrants radiological tumor assessment to verify or refute disease progression.  Perform on Day 1 [-3/+0] for cycles ≥ 2.  
Pregnancy Test: Women of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test result (serum or urine) within 7 days prior to 
randomization. To be repeated as clinically indicated. 

7. 

8.  Urinalysis: As clinically indicated.  
9. 
10. 
11.  BSA, Study Drug Administration, Dispensing, and Accountability: At the start of each treatment cycle, the patient’s BSA will be 

ECG: To be repeated as clinically indicated. 
IVRS Randomization: After the patient is deemed eligible for study entry, the patient will be randomized to study treatment through IVRS.  

determined using the current weight and Screening height. Study drug will be administered in the clinic (RPR109881 and capecitabine). 
One to four cycle’s-worth of capecitabine will be dispensed to patients depending on local packaging. Patients dispensed two cycles-worth 
of capecitabine (in bottles only) will also be dispensed a patient diary to record tablet administration. Capecitabine tablet counts will be 
performed at the time of resupply or withdrawal if resupply is not warranted.  

12.  Tumor Assessment: 

CT(unless contraindicated): A scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to be performed during Screening,  at the end of each even-
numbered treatment cycle, whenever disease progression is suspected, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit, using the same 
method for each assessment. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST requires the presence of at least one measurable target lesion at 
baseline. Measurable lesions are lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter ≥ 20 mm with 
conventional CT.  With spiral CT scan, lesion must be ≥ 10 mm in at least one dimension. For the purpose of analysis, a CR or PR will be 
deemed a confirmed response if a subsequent assessment has been performed at least 4 weeks after the first assessment and the results 
confirm the initial finding. 
Bone Scan: For patients with negative bone scan at screening, repeat bone scans should be performed as clinically indicated. For patients 
with positive bone scan at Screening who do not have new or worsening bone symptoms, repeat scans must be performed at the end of 
every 4th treatment cycle. For patients with new or worsening bone symptoms, repeat bone scans must be performed at the end of every 
2nd treatment cycle. Additionally, bone scan will be performed in any patient whenever disease progression in the bone is suspected, and 
at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit (see relevant footnote). For all patients with positive baseline bone scan who achieve a partial or 
complete response on the other tumor assessment, bone scan will be repeated to confirm the response. Bone scans are not necessary if 
there exists clear objective evidence of progression by other assessments in sites other than bone. PET may not substitute for bone scan. 
Bone marrow aspiration: Suspected bone marrow involvement at Screening (eg, due to a leukoerythroblastic peripheral blood smear), 
must be verified by bone marrow aspiration and documented. For patients with previously documented positive bone marrow who achieve a 
complete response, please contact the sponsor with respect to the need for repeat aspiration. 
Day 120 Assessment: The Day 120 assessment must be performed for all patients (CT scan). If the end-of-even-numbered-cycle tumor 
assessment for retreatment is performed within the Day 120 window (+/-7 days), then one set of scans will suffice for both purposes. The 
third assessment of tumor response should be timed to correspond with the Day 120 assessment whenever possible.

Footnotes for Study Schedule (cont) 

13.  Physical Examination: Examination of major body systems including complete neurological exam, vital signs (temperature, blood 

pressure, heart rate), height (Screening only), body weight, and ECOG PS. 
Results will be recorded on appropriate CRFs (eg, medical/tumor history, existing signs and symptoms, adverse events). 

14.  Adverse Event Assessment: The period of observation for collection of adverse events extends from the start of treatment with study drug 

(investigational agent or comparator) until 30 days after the final dose of study drug. Serious adverse events should be followed as 
described in the protocol. 

15.  Assessment of Concomitant Medications and Treatments: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 7 days prior 
to the initial dose of study drug until 30 days after the final dose of study drug. Additionally, bisphosphonate administration within the 120 
days prior to study entry will be recorded. 

16.  QLQ-30 / BR23 Questionnaires: The baseline assessment must be performed before randomization but not earlier than 7 days prior to 

randomization. No assessment will be performed on the date of the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1). Subsequent Day 1 assessments will begin at 
the start of Cycle 2. During the Follow-up period, the QLQ-30/BR23 questionnaires will be administered only to those patients being 
followed for disease progression at a frequency of every 6 weeks (to coincide with radiological imaging) until disease progression or start of 
another anticancer therapy.  

17.  EQ-5D Questionnaire: The baseline assessment will be performed before randomization but not earlier than 7 days prior to randomization. 
No assessment will be performed on the date of the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1). Subsequent assessments will be performed on Day 1 of odd 
cycles only (eg, Cycles 3, 5, 7, etc). During the Follow-up period, the EQ-5D questionnaires will be administered only to those patients 
being followed for disease progression at a frequency of every 6 weeks (to coincide with radiological imaging) until disease progression or 
start of another anticancer therapy. 

18.  Resource Utilization: Resource Utilization data will be collected on Day 1 of odd-numbered cycles only excluding Cycle 1 (eg, Cycles 3, 5, 

7, etc) until the patient discontinues study drug. 

19.  End of Study (Treatment)/Withdrawal: Obtain these assessments within 22-30 days following the final dose of study drug, CT scan (if not 
performed within the prior 6 weeks), and bone scan for patients with new or worsening bone symptoms and for patients with positive bone 
scan at Screening if not performed within the prior 12 weeks. Bone scans are not necessary if there exists clear objective evidence of 
progression by other assessments in sites other than bone. At the end of the 30-day post-treatment period (up to Day 37 post-treatment), 
assessment of adverse events, concomitant medications and any examinations or tests required to support these assessments must be 
performed. 

20.  Post-Study Therapy, Disease and Survival Status: During the follow-up period, patients who went off study treatment prior to 

documented disease progression will have tumor assessments every 6 weeks from End of Study until disease progression. For patients 
with bone disease at Screening, repeat bone scans will continue every 6 weeks in patients with new or worsening bone symptoms or every 
12 weeks in patients who do not have new or worsening bone symptoms until tumor progression or start of other anticancer therapy. Bone 
scans are not necessary if there exists clear objective evidence of progression by other assessments in sites other than bone. Additionally, 
tumor assessments will be performed as necessary according to RECIST to confirm response and/or to document progression. Following 
documented disease progression, patients will be contacted every 3 months to document subsequent anti-cancer treatment and survival.

INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE 

Further details can be found in the Investigational Brochure [1], which contains comprehensive 
information on RPR109881. 

1.1  BREAST CANCER 

1.1.1  Medical need 

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with approximately 207,000 
new patients diagnosed each year, and accounts for 15% of all cancer deaths in women in the 
United States [1]. Approximately 30% of breast cancer is diagnosed with regional spread, and 5-
10% with distant metastases at diagnosis, and about 41,000 women die of breast cancer each year 
in the United States [1]. Once the disease becomes metastatic, it is considered incurable. While 
multiple treatments with various chemotherapy combinations may be attempted, responses are 
generally short lived and the median survival is approximately 2 years. Survival at 5-years after 
metastases develop is only 23% [1,2,3]. There remains a large unmet medical need for this patient 
population and investigation for improved therapy is urgently needed. 

1.1.2  Breast cancer treatment 

1.1.2.1  Chemotherapy 

The most active agents for MBC are the anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin) and the taxanes 
(paclitaxel, docetaxel) [2,3,4]. While monotherapy or combination of multiple agents (eg, 
vinorelbine, gemcitabine, mitomycin) are used in the treatment of MBC after failure of 
anthracyclines and taxanes with response rates for combination regimens of 0% to 62% and for 
single agents of 0% to 29% (reviewed in [13, 5]), only capecitabine (Xeloda®) is currently 
approved in patients with MBC resistant to paclitaxel therapy and anthracycline therapy, or for 
whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated. In such patients, the development of 
alternative or of more effective agents is needed. 

Taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, are tubulin-binding molecules with the property of 
promoting the polymerization of purified tubulin in vitro and, at high concentrations, of enhancing 
the fraction of polymerized tubulin in cells. 

1.1.2.2  Drug resistance 

Over the course of treatment many tumors acquire resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, limiting 
further treatment options and increasing the clinical challenge of disease management. Several 
mechanisms for taxane resistance are possible, including the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), 
the product of the mdr-1 (multi-drug resistance) gene. P-gp is a drug-efflux pump that rapidly 
eliminates drug substrates, including taxanes, from the cell. Other proposed mechanisms of taxane

Final 

resistance include altered metabolism and/or distribution of the taxanes, changes to the 
interactions of taxane with tubulin including mutations in the tubulin gene or altered expression of 
β-tubulin isotypes, and inadequate induction of apoptotic signals [14-24]. Clinically, resistance to 
chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer has been defined in multiple ways (reviewed in 
[25]). The most important determinants of clinical resistance are the initial response to the 
chemotherapy, and the interval of time from the last treatment until relapse (after adjuvant 
treatment) or progression (after treatment for metastatic disease) [25]. Patients who progress 
during anthracycline treatment, and especially those whose best response to treatment was 
progression have lower responses to subsequent treatments, and lower survival. [25]. 

1.2  RPR109881 

RPR109881 is a novel taxoid found to be active in preclinical models of docetaxel-resistance. 
Clinically, this compound appears to have a safety profile similar to docetaxel, and in a phase II 
trial was found to be active in patients with metastatic breast cancer relapsing or progressing after 
docetaxel or paclitaxel and anthracycline treatment. 

1.2.1  Molecular formula 

RPR109881 is a taxoid derivative of the formula C45H53NO14 (Mr = 831.9), the dihydrate of 
which has the formula C45H53NO14, 2H2O (Mr = 867.9). 

1.2.2  Activity studies in preclinical models 

In vitro, RPR109881 is a novel taxane found to retain the activity of docetaxel in promoting the 
polymerization of tubulin and in stabilizing microtubules against cold-induced depolymerization. 
RPR109881 and docetaxel were directly compared on a panel of murine and human cell lines 
from different histological types, and were found to exert identical antiproliferative activities. 

1.2.2.1 

In vivo schedule determination 

In vivo, different schedules were tested to establish the optimal schedule of RPR109881 
administration. The optimal schedule of administration was first determined by comparing three 
administration schedules using non tumor-bearing mice: 1) an intermittent schedule, days 1 and 5 
(ie, 2 administrations), 2) a daily schedule, days 1 to 5 (ie, 5 administrations), and 3) a split dose 
schedule, days 1 to 5 three times a day (ie, 15 administrations). 

A trend for schedule dependency on host toxicity was observed in these trials. Over the same total 
treatment duration, the intermittent schedule allowed administration of the highest dosage on a 
mg/kg basis, and produced a greater efficacy and an improved therapeutic index. This intermittent 
schedule was selected for testing antitumor efficacy.

1.2.2.2  Murine and human tumor models 

RPR109881 i.v. was active against s.c. tumors sensitive to docetaxel such as: early stage B16 
melanoma, advanced stage mammary adenocarcinoma MA13/C, colon adenocarcinoma C38 and 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma P03. 

In tumor models with less sensitivity to docetaxel such as Lewis lung carcinoma, pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma P02, colon carcinoma C26, mammary adenocarcinoma MA44/C, Glasgow 
osteogenic sarcoma G0S, the activities of RPR109881 and docetaxel were similar. However, 
RPR109881 was more active than docetaxel in i.p. P388 leukemia. 

In nude mice models of advanced human xenograft tumors of breast (Calc18), colon (HCT-8, 
HCT 116), pancreas (MIA PaCa-2) and lung (PC14) origin, the activities of RPR109881 and 
docetaxel were similar. A 2.6-fold greater efficacy was observed with RPR109881 as compared to 
that of docetaxel in colon HCT-8 tumors. Activity was also observed against early stage 
intracranial glioblastomas. 

RPR109881 has been combined with several clinically available agents, such as doxorubicin, 
cisplatin, navelbine, 5-fluorouracil and CPT-11 in murine models. These combinations were 
found active, three were synergistic (doxorubicin, cisplatin and navelbine). There is only modest 
overlap in host toxicity with RPR1009881 in combination with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, or 
navelbine, and a marked increase in combination with CPT-11 or cisplatin. 

1.2.2.3  Multidrug resistance studies 

In vitro studies utilizing highly drug-resistant cell lines bearing the multidrug-resistance 
phenotype, such as P388/DOX and KB V1, demonstrated that RPR109881 was much less 
recognized than docetaxel, and was minimally recognized by moderately drug-resistant cell lines 
such as P388/TXT, P388/VCR, HL60/TAX and CALC 18/TXT. In vitro transport studies across 
tumor cells expressing P-gp confirmed that RPR109881 is minimally recognized by P-gp. 

In vivo confirmation of the in vitro findings was found in 2/3 tumor models with the multidrug 
resistance phenotype. RPR109881 was found to be active in leukemia resistant to vincristine 
(P388/VCR) and in the B16 melanoma with acquired resistance to docetaxel (B16/TXT). The 
B16/TXT model may be more relevant to clinical situations because it is fully resistant to 
docetaxel, it maintains the doubling time and histological properties of B16 melanoma, and has a 
low over-expression of the mdr1 murine gene. 

1.2.3  Preclinical safety pharmacology studies 

The receptor binding profile of RPR109881 tested up to 10 µM suggests that it is unlikely that this 
compound would evoke non-specific in vivo pharmacological effects. 

No physiologically relevant effects were noted on the central nervous, respiratory and gastro-
intestinal systems and on bile secretion after single intravenous administration of RPR109881 in 
rats or guinea-pigs and no interactions with various spasmogens were observed in in vitro guinea-
pig ileum preparations. Slight increases in urinary Na+, Cl-, uric acid and protein concentrations

were observed following intravenous administration of RPR109881 in water-loaded rats. Slight 
decrease in thrombin time and slight increase in prothrombin time were noted after intravenous 
administration of RPR109881 in rats. 

RPR109881 up to 10 µM did not modify the action potential parameters of guinea pig Purkinje 
fibers in in vitro preparations when compared to polysorbate 80. In anesthetized rats, RPR109881 
infused over approximately 1 hour did not modify substantially mean carotid artery blood 
pressure and heart rate compared to polysorbate 80. Furthermore RPR109881 infused over 
approximately 1 hour in anesthetized dogs produced cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes 
(marked hypotension, decrease in carotid and femoral artery resistance and in carotid blood flow, 
increase in heart rate) similar to those noted after the administration of polysorbate 80 and were 
therefore likely attributable to the polysorbate 80 component of the vehicle. 

1.2.4  Preclinical toxicology studies 

1.2.4.1  General toxicity studies 

Nonclinical toxicity studies were performed with RPR109881 using single-dose and 5-day daily 
intravenous administration in mice, rats and dogs and weekly intravenous administration in mice 
and dogs. Tissues with a high cell turnover were predominantly affected and toxicological effects 
of RPR109881 were similar to those observed with the other marketed taxoids. The main changes 
considered related to the pharmacological properties of RPR109881 (inhibition of tubulin 
depolymerization and therefore interference with mitosis) consisted of hair loss, decreases in 
circulating blood cells, hypocellularity of the bone marrow, crypt/gland cell necrosis along the 
intestinal tract associated clinically with diarrhea, necrosis/atrophy of lymphoid tissues and 
degeneration of epithelium in the testes and epididymides. In addition, increased serum levels of 
liver enzymes, total bilirubin, cholesterol and/or triglycerides, and microscopic liver changes (bile 
duct hyperplasia, bile duct necrosis, periportal fibrosis, intra-hepatic cholestasis, centrilobular 
inflammation) and gallbladder findings were observed in the weekly toxicity study conducted in 
dogs. RPR109881 produced central neurotoxicity (minimal to moderate necrosis of neurons in the 
brain, vacuolization and degeneration in the spinal cord) and peripheral neurotoxicity (sciatic 
nerve and lumbar nerve root degeneration) in mice only. The No-Observable Effect Level 
(NOEL) for central and peripheral neurotoxicity in mice following a single 1-minute intravenous 
administration was below 90 mg/m2 while the NOEL for central and peripheral neurotoxicity in 
mice following a single 1-hour intravenous administration were 90 and 45 mg/m2, respectively. 
Peripheral and central neurotoxicity were not observed in rats and dogs. 

1.2.4.2  Mutagenicity and reproduction studies 

RPR109881 was found negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test. The responses in the mouse 
lymphoma assay, the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and the chromosome aberration test 
in CHO cells were considered to be a class effect of anticancer drugs which affect microtubules. 

RPR109881 was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits and only slight developmental effects were 
observed. RPR109881 did not affect mating performances or fertility of the male or female rat.

1.2.4.3 

Irritation and reactivity studies 

RPR109881 did not show an irritation potential after intravenous, paravenous or intra-arterial 
administration in the ears of rabbits and did not produce antigenicity reactions in guinea pigs or in 
mice. 

In vitro studies on hemo-compatibility suggested that solutions of RPR109881 were compatible 
with human plasma and serum. 

1.2.5  Pharmacokinetics and metabolism studies in animals 

RPR109881 pharmacokinetics after intravenous administration were characterized in tumor-free 
and tumor bearing mice, rats, and dogs. The decrease in plasma concentrations was consistent 
with a two-compartment model. The initial half-life was very short (0.05-0.22 h) and probably 
related to a rapid drug distribution phase in all tested species. Thereafter, RPR109881 was rapidly 
eliminated from dog plasma with a terminal half-life of about 0.6 h. In rats and mice, a longer 
elimination of the compound was observed with terminal half-lives of approximately 1.5 h and 
3.2 h, respectively. The volume of distribution at steady-state was approximately five- and ten-
fold lower in dogs than in mice and rats (0.5 vs. 2.4 and 5.3 L/kg, respectively). The plasma 
clearance was low in the mouse (0.6 L/h/kg) and high in the rat (3 L/h/kg) and dog (2.5 L/h/kg). 

Area under the time concentration curve (AUCs) increased approximately proportionally to 
RPR109881 doses up to 182 mg/m² in tumor-bearing mice after a single intravenous infusion. In 
contrast, an overproportional relationship was observed in rats. Exposure remained similar after 
repeat administrations. 

The in vitro binding of RPR109881 to plasma proteins was very high (96.1 to 99.6%) in mouse, 
rat, dog, monkey, and human plasma and non-saturable up to 30 µg/mL. 

In tumor-bearing mice, the terminal half-lives observed in tissues were similar to those observed 
in plasma (1.6-7.5 h vs. 4.4 h), except in tumor (9.8 h) and in brain (estimated at 48 h). 
Tissue/plasma AUC ratios ranged from 0.5 (heart) to about 11 (brain). In tumor, this ratio was 
approximately 2. 

A distribution study with radiolabeled compound in rats showed rapid tissue uptake especially 
into the intestine, spleen, thyroid, kidneys, stomach, liver, ovary, heart, and lungs. The tissues of 
the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord) and the male genital organs (testis, epididymis) 
contained low radioactivity levels as well. Elimination of drug-related material from tissues was 
largely complete within 96 h. Tissue radioactivity retention at 72 h was only (0.9-1.4%) in mice 
and rats. 

For all investigated species, radioactivity was largely excreted in the feces via the bile (83-96% of 
the administered dose), whereas the urinary route contributed markedly less (2-9%). 
Enterohepatic recycling of radiolabeled compound was relatively low, since approximately 12% 
of the radioactivity excreted in bile was reabsorbed.

Final 

Almost no parent RPR109881 was excreted in urine, bile or feces (<3%) and metabolism is the 
main elimination pathway of RPR109881 in all species. Twelve to 36 metabolites were observed 
in bile, urine, and feces from mice, rats, and dogs. 
In vitro, both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are involved in the human metabolism of RPR109881. 6α-
hydroxy-RPR109881 was the main metabolite in liver microsomes from all tested species, 
including man. In vivo, parent RPR109881 was the predominant component circulating in mouse, 
rat, and dog plasma, based on AUC values (approximately 72%, 69-81% and 44 % of the 
radioactivity, respectively). As noted in vitro, the major metabolic pathway in vivo, in mice, rats, 
and dogs involves hydroxylation at the C6-position of the baccatin moiety to form 6α-hydroxy-
RPR109881. Metabolites derived from this pathway were found to undergo further oxidation at 
the para-position of the phenyl group at C-3’ to give 3’-(4-hydroxyphenyl) 6α-hydroxy-
RPR109881 in mice and rats or by a further phase II reaction to yield the 6-O-glucuronide-
RPR109881 in rats and dogs. 

1.3 

PRELIMINARY PHARMACOKINETICS IN HUMANS 

Pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed in 129 patients from Europe, the US, Canada, and 
Japan over the 7.5-120 mg/m² dose range after intravenous infusion of 1 to 24 hours. Plasma 
samples were collected in all patients in at least one cycle and up to 5 cycles during the first 7 
cycles. 

RPR109881 plasma concentrations were consistent with a two- or a three- compartment open 
model. In 12 out of 14 patients receiving low RPR109881 doses (up to 45 mg/m²), the third phase 
was not observed, probably because of the limit of quantitation of the bioanalytical method 
(5 ng/mL). The initial phase with a half-life of approximately 2-10 minutes was not observed after 
a 24-hour intravenous infusion.

The plasma clearance of RPR109881 is high (mean value of 38 L/h/m²), representing about 80% 
of the hepatic blood flow. A large distribution volume was observed in all phase I studies (mean 
Vss of 785 L/m²) and the terminal half-life of RPR109881 is long (approximately 26 h). 

The pharmacokinetics of RPR109881 are independent of both administration schedule and dose 
over the investigated range (7.5-120 mg/m²). No plasma drug accumulation is observed between 
day 1 and day 8 (1-h i.v. infusion schedule), and plasma clearance is stable over up to 7 
consecutive chemotherapy courses. No relevant pharmacokinetic differences are observed 
between Caucasian and Japanese cancer patients. A meta-analysis of phase I data (except 
Japanese Phase I data) showed that the inter-patient variability in clearance in this population is 
moderate (27.9%) and the intra-patient (inter-occasion) variability is low (22.5%). The inter-
patient variability in clearance is significantly related to body surface area (BSA). Therefore 
BSA-adjusted dosing leads to a decreased variability in AUC. 

In an analysis of pharmacodynamic relationships, decrease in absolute neutrophil or white blood 
cell count at nadir correlated with AUC of unbound RPR109881. 

RPR109881 was detected in one specimen of CSF (5.3 ng/ml) and in one post-mortem brain 
sample (51.2 ng/g) suggesting that RPR109881 crosses the blood-brain barrier in humans. 

Urinary excretion of unchanged RPR109881 is very low for all administration schedules 
investigated (less than 2% of the administered dose over a 0-48 h post dosing period). This 
finding was confirmed by the preliminary results from 7 patients included in Phase I Study XRP 
9881/1001 and treated with 14C- RPR109881 at 75 mg/m², which demonstrated that the

Final 

radioactivity was largely excreted in the feces via the bile (81.4% of the administered dose), while 
the urinary route contributes markedly less (6.6%).. 

The in vitro human plasma protein binding of RPR109881 is high (97-99%), and the 
plasma/blood cell partionning is 0.75. 

The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are involved in RPR109881 
biotransformation in vitro. The main metabolite produced in human liver microsomes is 6α-
hydroxy-RPR109881. RPR109881 at concentrations up to 10 µM (approximately 10-fold Cmax in 
vivo) did not inhibit CYP1A2, -2A6, -2C19 or -2E1 in vitro. Some inhibition of CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4 was observed (57% and 47%, respectively) and to a lesser extent of CYP2D6 (20-30%) 
at the highest concentration of RPR109881 (10 µM). 

Vinorelbine and docetaxel and acetaminophen (paracetamol) inhibited the oxidative metabolism 
of RPR109881 in vitro (5 µM) with an IC50 of 2.5 µM, 5 µM and 1000 µM, respectively, ie, near 
to their Cmax in vivo. Phenytoin (IC50 = 200 µM), carbamazepine (IC50 = 290 µM), warfarin (IC50 
= 61 µM) were also found to inhibit the oxidative biotranformation of RPR109881 and this 
inhibition was mainly metabolism dependent. However, phenytoin and carbamazepine are known 
to induce CYP2C and CYP3A isoenzymes, which could thus counteract a possible inhibition of 
RPR109881 oxidative biotransformation. Omeprazole is a weak in vitro inhibitor of RPR109881 
oxidation since the IC50 (50 µM) represents 100 fold its Cmax in vivo. Susceptibility to undergo to 
drug-drug interaction is quite minimal because of the high hepatic clearance and the i.v. 
administration of RPR109881. In similar experimental conditions, none of the following drugs 
were inhibitors: irinotecan, cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, morphine, 
methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, valproic acid, phenobarbital, diphenhydramine, 
prochlorperazine, digoxin and acetyl salicylic acid. These results suggest that if acetaminophen 
and warfarin need to be administered to a patient receiving RPR109881, administration of the two

PRELIMINARY CLINICAL FINDINGS 

Study 101 is a Phase I study evaluating the safety of RPR109881 administered as a 1-hour 
infusion every 3 weeks as a single agent. Although other studies evaluating other schedules were 
also performed, the dose limiting toxicity in those studies was similar to that of the 3-week 
schedule, and the incidence of adverse events was similar or worse compared to the 3-week 
regimen. Study 106 evaluated the safety of 1-hour versus 3-hour infusion of RPR109881 
administered every 3 weeks, and the safety results for the 1-hour infusion arm confirmed the 
results obtained in Study 101. The 1-hour every 3 weeks schedule was therefore selected for 
Phase II studies for patient convenience. The data of Study 101 will be presented in detail. 

Thirty-four patients (17 males and 17 females), median age: 59 years (range: 19-73) were 
included in the Phase I Study 101 of RPR109881 administered as a 1-hour infusion every 
3 weeks. These patients presented with various tumor types: the most frequent were lung 
(7 patients), sarcoma (5 patients), stomach and kidney (4 patients). Thirty-three of 34 patients had 
been previously treated with chemotherapy. Twenty-five patients (73.5%) had received 1 or 2 
different chemotherapy regimens. Twelve patients had received prior radiotherapy.

Premedication with oral corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg) was administered at -25 h, 
-13 h and -1 hour before RPR109881. 

The median (range) number of cycles was 2 (1-8). Only 3 of 107 cycles were given at a dose 
lower than the one initially planned: one at a starting dose of 90 mg/m² because of the occurrence 
of grade 4 allergic reaction and two at a starting dose of 105 mg/m² because of severe 
hematological toxicity reported after the first cycle. Six patients had RPR109881 infusion delayed 
for 4 to 11 days beyond the scheduled administration date for one cycle, but in no case was the 
delay related to an adverse effect of the drug. 

1.4.1  Safety of RPR109881 in Phase I Study 101 

The most commonly reported clinical AEs by patient at all doses tested considered at least 
possibly related to the study drug were: gastrointestinal (67.6%), skin (58.8%), flu-like symptoms 
(41.2%), neurological disorders (20.6%), infections (11.8%) and fluid retention (8.8%) using the 
NCIC-CTC classification. Hypersensitivity was reported in 14.8% of 27 evaluable patients. 

One toxic death due to septic shock was observed in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer after 
the first cycle at a dose of 90 mg/m². 

Three patients discontinued the study treatment due to AEs at least possibly related to the study 
drug: grade-3 diarrhea (cycle 1) and grade-3 fluid retention (cycle 2) at 60 mg/m2, and grade-4 
allergy (cycle 2) at 90 mg/m2. 

A total of 26 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 14 patients. Among them, 18 SAEs 
reported in 11 patients were considered as at least possibly related to the study drug. The most 
frequent at least possibly drug-related SAEs were febrile neutropenia (4 SAEs, in three patients), 
diarrhea, fever in absence of infection and infection (1 SAE in each of two patients). The other 
drug-related SAEs were reported in one patient each: allergy, bronchospasm, fatigue, fluid 
retention, flushing, nausea, neuromotor disorder and neurosensory disorder. 

All except two patients [i.e., 29 patients (85.3%)] treated at doses of 60-105 mg/m2 developed 
neutropenia of any grade. Grade-3 neutropenia was reported in seven patients (20.6%) and grade-
4 neutropenia in 21 patients (61.8%). Median lowest nadirs of neutrophil count observed at 75, 90 
and 105 mg/m2, were 0.3 x 103/mm3, 0.2 x 103/mm3 and less than 0.1 x 103/mm3, respectively. 
Median time to nadir ranged from 10 to 11 days. Partial or total recovery from neutropenia 
occurred on day 22 ± 3 after drug infusion, except in two cases (grade 3 and grade 4 in two 
cycles, respectively at 90 mg/m2). 

The duration of grade-4 neutropenias observed in cycles with at least two blood counts between 
day 6 and day 15 (37 cycles = 2 at 75 mg/m², 29 at 90 mg/m² and 6 at 105 mg/m²) ranged from 2 
to 18 days. The median duration of grade-4 neutropenia was 5 days at 90 mg/m² and 7 days at 
105 mg/m². Grade-4 neutropenias with duration >7 days were dose-limiting toxicities. They were 
reported in five patients for a total of 6 cycles at 90 mg/m2, and in one patient for 2 cycles at 
105 g/m2.

Final 

Anemia of any grade was reported in 98 of the 107 evaluable cycles (91.6%). Grade-3 and grade-
4 anemias were reported each in one cycle at 90 mg/m2. 

The most frequently reported abnormal biochemistry test results (of any grade) were transitory 
increases of ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase. All these variations recovered within one week. 
Grade-3 values were infrequently reported and no grade-4 value was reported. Bilirubin 
elevations were also noted, most commonly in patients with liver metastases. One grade 4 
bilirubin elevation was noted. 

The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated after the first cycle to define how to escalate 
the dose in the subsequent patients and to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). The 
dose-limiting toxicities were defined as: 

Hematologic: 

Neutrophils gr. 4 >7 days or Platelets gr. 4 

Febrile neutropenia:  Neutrophils gr. 4 with fever gr. ≥2 (38.5°C single elevation in oral 

temperature or 3 elevations > 38°C during a 24-hour period). 

Non-hematologic: 

Adverse events gr. 3 or 4 excluding nausea, vomiting, and alopecia. 

In this protocol that was initiated in 1996, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the 
dose expected to be the dose at which 50% of patients treated experienced a DLT. The MTD was 
reached at 105 mg/m² at which 2 patients out of 5 experienced DLTs. All these DLTs were related 
to the hematologic toxicity of the compound. In one case (patient No. 25), non- hematological 
DLTs (diarrhea grade-4 and lethargy grade-3) were associated with the hematological DLT. The 
recommended dose for Phase II trials was 90 mg/m². At the recommended dose of 90 mg/m2, the 
number of first-cycle DLTs was 2 out of 8 (25%), which is more consistent with current 
definitions of MTD. 

The incidence of non-hematologic toxicities at the recommended dose of 90 mg/m² for the various 
schedules studied listed by patient and by cycle are presented in Table 3 and Table 4 respectively. 
As can be noted, fatigue and diarrhea were the most common non-hematologic grade 3 or 4 
toxicities.

1.4.2  Preliminary activity of RPR109881 in patients with metastatic breast cancer after 

taxane therapy 

Study 204, ‘A phase II multi-center, open label, non-randomized study of RPR 109881 given as a 
one-hour infusion at 90mg/m² every 3 weeks to female patients with metastatic breast cancer’, is a 
single arm, open label, multi-center, multinational study which is currently ongoing. Preliminary 
results after the latest interim analysis demonstrate activity of RPR109881 in patients with 
paclitaxel or docetaxel resistance. 

Patients with metastatic breast cancer progressing after taxanes were eligible for this trial. Upon 
entry, patients were stratified into those patients who progressed after objective response to 
taxanes (non-resistant stratum) and into those patients progressing while on taxane, patients not 
achieving an objective response to taxane, or patients recurring within 12 months of taxane-based 
(neo-) adjuvant therapy (resistant stratum). 

Patients were treated with RPR109881, 90 mg/m² i.v. every 3 weeks, until evidence of 
progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. Thirty minutes prior to 
chemotherapy, patients receive premedication with dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg i.v., 
diphenhydramine 25 mg i.v. or other anti H1 receptor antagonist; with ranitidine 50 mg i.v., and

with dexamethasone 8 mg i.v. or other corticosteroids equivalent. Antiemetic prophylaxis was not 
permitted prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy. In case of nausea/vomiting, patients could 
receive preventive antiemetic treatment in compliance with the conventional antiemetic protocol 
of the center for the subsequent cycles.

1.4.2.2  Response rate in Study 204 using definition for proposed Study 3001 

Of the 47 patients progressing or relapsing within 12 months of taxanes, 4 were not evaluable for 
response to RPR109881 (1 patient had an early toxic death, 2 patients withdrew consent prior to 
response evaluation due to adverse events, 1 patient did not undergo evaluation mandated by the 
protocol). Two patients were found not to be eligible (1 patient pretreated with epothilone whose 
best response to RPR109881 was PD, 1 patient who received only 3 weeks of weekly paclitaxel 
whose best response to RPR109881 was SD). 

Fourteen of the 45 eligible patients progressing or relapsing within 12 months were found to have 
partial responses (31%, 95% CI= 18,47).

1.4.2.3  Adverse events in Study 204 

The median number of cycles of RPR109881 received in Study 204 was 4 (1-12). The main 
hematological toxicities found in patients in Study 204 are listed in Table 6. The most common 
toxicity was neutropenia grade 3 or 4, which was found in 79% of patients (51% grade 4). The 
incidence of neutropenic complications is found in Table 7. Febrile neutropenia was present in 4 
patients (5%), and 1 patient died of septic death (1%).

The main non-hematological toxicities are listed in Table 8. Common non-hematological 
toxicities include diarrhea, neurosensory disorders, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, 
arthralgia and myalgia. These toxicities were mostly grades 1 or 2. The diarrhea was clinically 
predictable and manageable with standard supportive care consisting of loperamide or other anti-
diarrheal agents. Sixty patients (77%) reported sensory neuropathy during treatment, 6 (8%) grade 
3 and 0 grade 4. However, 25 patients (32%) had sensory neuropathy at baseline, perhaps due to 
prior taxane treatment. Five of the 6 patients who reported grade 3 sensory neuropathy during 
treatment had not reported neuropathy at baseline. In distinction to docetaxel, peripheral edema 
was rare, and hypersensitivity and nail changes were uncommon although patients received a 
median number of 4 cycles of RPR109881. In addition, 3 patients had hypersensitivity reactions 
(2 grade 1, 1 grade 2) and 3 patients had edema (breast edema (1 grade 1), lymphedema (1 grade 
1, 1 grade 2), edema of upper limb (1 grade 2). As mentioned, patients did not receive anti-emetic

prophylaxis in the first cycle of treatment, and received one dose of anti-histamine and steroid 
prophylaxis. 

Three patients died within 30 days of receiving RPR109881. Two patients died due to toxicity 
from study drug as reported by the investigator. One had a septic death 10 days after receiving 
RPR109881 treatment and one died with abdominal pain and dyspnea 10 days after receiving 
RPR109881. One patient died of progressive disease. 

In summary, the toxicities of RPR109881 appear to be manageable and comparable to that of 
other approved agents used in this clinical setting.

1.4.3  Capecitabine 

Capecitabine, which is the comparator treatment in the present study, is a fluoropyrimidine 
carbamate with antineoplastic activity. It is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5’-deoxy-
5-fluorouridine (5’-DFUR) which is converted to 5- fluorouracil. The enzyme dihydropyrimidine 
dehydrogenase hydrogenates 5-FU, the product of capecitabine metabolism, to the much less 
toxic 5-fluoro-5, 6-dihydro-fluorouracil (FUH2). As mentioned, capecitabine monotherapy is 
approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and 
an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or resistant to paclitaxel and for whom further

anthracycline therapy is not indicated. Anthracycline therapy is not indicated in patients who have 
received cumulative doses of 400 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or doxorubicin equivalents [12]. 

In the pivotal single arm Phase II trial reported in the Xeloda® label and later published (8,9), an 
objective response rate (RR) of 25.6%, median time to progression (TTP) of 102 days, and 
median overall survival (OS) of 255 days were noted in patients doubly resistant to paclitaxel and 
to anthracyclines (as per label). For the 135 patients with measurable disease, the RR was 18.5%, 
TTP was 90 days, and OS was 306 days. 

In further trials of capecitabine in patients previously treated with taxanes and anthracyclines, the 
response rate to capecitabine has ranged from 9 to 25%, median TTP 3.0 – 4.6 months, and 
median OS from 10.4 – 15.2 months [6-11]. Of importance in analyzing these results, the 
definition of resistance to taxane was not consistent from one trial to the other. Thus, although 
capecitabine is an active drug in patients with metastatic breast cancer including patients 
previously treated with taxanes, its reported activity after resistance and failure to taxanes lies 
within a wide range, in part due to the variations in the population of patients studied. 

The major toxicities of capecitabine in the product insert for patients treated with monotherapy for 
breast cancer are: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, abdominal pain, constipation, hand-and-
foot syndrome, dermatitis, nail disorder, fatigue, pyrexia, paraesthesia, anorexia, eye irritation, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, and hyperbilirubinemia [12]. 

1.4.4  Summary 

The proposed trial will compare the activity of RPR109881 and capecitabine in patients with 
MBC progressing after taxanes and anthracycline therapy. The activity of RPR109881 in 
preclinical models and in a Phase II trial in this patient population, the acceptable and manageable 
toxicities of RPR109881, and the reported activity and toxicity of capecitabine support the 
conduct of the present trial.

STUDY DESIGN, DURATION, AND DATES 

3.1 

STUDY DESIGN 

This will be a global multi-center, open-label, two-arm randomized, phase III clinical trial. 
Patients will be randomized to treatment with RPR109881, 90 mg/m2 IV administered on Day 1 
of each 3-week cycle, or capecitabine, 1250 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily (morning and 
evening, equivalent to 2500 mg/m2 total daily dose) for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period 
given as 3-week cycles. Randomization will be stratified based on the treatment setting in which 
taxanes were given and prior taxanes responsiveness. 

Patients will continue to receive treatment until disease progression, patient intolerance, or 
withdrawal of consent. Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression will 
continue to have tumor assessments, QLQ-30/BR-23 and EQ-5D assessments every 6 weeks. 
Following disease progression or start of another anticancer therapy, patients will be treated by 
their physicians as determined by usual medical practice and followed every 3 months for start of 
subsequent anticancer therapy, and survival. Patients treated on the capecitabine arm will not be 
eligible to receive RPR109881 in this or other clinical breast cancer trials. 

Radiological tumor assessments will be performed at baseline, at the end of every even-numbered 
treatment cycle (every 6 weeks, after Cycles 2, 4, 6, etc…), and whenever disease progression is 
suspected. In addition, a radiological tumor assessment to obtain a single time progression rate 
(STPR) will be obtained at Day 120 (+/- 7 days) for all patients. After the patient is withdrawn 
from study treatment, a tumor assessment will be performed if an assessment has not been 
performed within the prior 6 weeks. Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to disease 
progression will continue to have tumor assessments until disease progression or start of another 
anticancer therapy. In order for a response to be considered durable, all patients with an objective 
response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) must have the response confirmed 
between 4-6 weeks after the initial documentation of response. All scans will be independently 
reviewed in real-time to assess for response to treatment (PR or CR) and disease progression. An 
independent review committee (IRC) will review the data during the conduct of the trial. 

The primary endpoint of Study 3001 will be progressin free survival (PFS) with overall survival 
(OS) and response rate (RR) as secondary efficacy endpoints in the intent-to-treat population. 
Time to progression / progression free survival is defined as the time from randomization to first 
evidence of progression, as defined by RECIST or death. Progression free survivalis the most 
appropriate primary endpoint for the proposed intervention and study population. Time to 
progression may be recorded in all randomized patients, is routinely determined as part of usual 
clinical oncology practice and most importantly, is not subject to the confounding influence of 
treatments administered subsequent to progression on protocol. This is particularly important in 
the proposed study as patients initially randomized to receive RPR109881 may cross-over, as part 
of usual clinical care, to subsequently receive capecitabine, while those patients randomized to 
capecitabine will not be eligible to receive RPR109881 in this or any other breast cancer clinical 
study protocol.

In order to minimize operational and analysis biases, careful attention to maintaining the protocol-
mandated frequency of assessment in both arms will be emphasized. Regardless of randomization 
or subsequent off-protocol therapy, all patients will be followed after progression to determine the 
overall survival in both arms on an intent-to-treat basis. 

3.2 

STUDY DURATION AND DATES 

The duration of this study is expected to be 20 months or until the observation of the required 
number of events needed for the final analysis of Progression free survivalThe last patient 
treatment visit, ie, 30 days after the last patient dose, is expected to take place at month 27 (May 
2006). The observation of the required event for survival is expected to take place at month 45 
(November 2007). The actual overall study duration or patient recruitment period may vary, 
depending on the observed accrual rate and progression/survival distributions. 

3.3 

STUDY CUT-OFF/CLOSURE 

Based on the results from scheduled futility analysis and further confirmatory analysis that were 
performed respectively in December 2005 and April 2006, the IDMC for the trial recommended 
that the study be closed for randomization.  The IDMC concluded that the safety profile of the 
study was acceptable for both arms. However, the protocol assumptions for efficacy were not met.  

Randomization for the study was stopped in January 2006. A total of 438 patients were enrolled. 
Patients who were still on active treatment were offered by their physicians to either continue to 
be treated with study drugs until protocol defined discontinuation were met or to be treated as per 
standard medical practice.  

Currently, there are 21 patients that are still on active treatment. The sponsor will continue to 
provide study drugs or appropriate reimbursement (for comparator drug) for those patients that are 
still receiving and benifitting from treatment on study.  

The study cut-off date was designated to be September 15th, 2006. After this date, patients still 
receiving treatment may remain on their assigned treatment using Sponsor-supplied study 
medication -XRP9881or commercially available capecitabine - (with Sponsor reimbursement) 
until one of the protocol-defined criteria for discontinuation of study treatment is met. 

CRFs will be collected for all treatment cycles completed on or before the September 15th, 
2006 cut-off date as well as for all follow-up visits completed prior to the database lock 
(estimated for 27th Oct 2006). 

CRFs will not be collected for any treatment cycles completed after the study cut-off date.   

However, for all patients that remain on active treatment after the cut-off date, serious adverse 
events (SAEs) occurring either while on active treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of 
active treatment should be reported to sanofi-aventis via the same method as during the study. 
Furthermore, any SAE considered (to have a reasonable possibility of being) related to study 
treatment should be reported to sanofi-aventis regardless of when it occurs.

SELECTION OF PATIENTS 

The patient population will consist of adult males or females with metastatic breast cancer that has 
progressed after taxane and anthracycline therapy. 

4.1  NUMBER OF PATIENTS 

This study will include a test arm (RPR109881) and a comparator arm (capecitabine). 
Approximately 800 patients, 400 patients randomized to the RPR109881 treatment arm and 400 
 
patients to the capecitabine treatment arm, 
 

• 
 
 

 

 

 

 

It is expected that each study site will enroll between 4-5 patients. No site shall enroll beyond 20 
patients without written approval from the sponsor followed by notification of the IRB/IEC. 
Sponsor approval will be based on both consideration of the potential for statistical analysis 
impact and the quality of work performed to date by the site as assessed through monitoring 
and/or auditing. Enrollment into the screening or randomization phase of the study will be stopped 
when the anticipated or actual patient numbers have been achieved across all study sites. 
Additionally, if the target number of events is attained prior to fully accruing patients to the study, 
the trial may be closed to further enrollment. 

The analysis of overall survival (OS) will be conducted when at least 618 deaths are observed, 
with a single interim analysis using an boundary determined by a Gamma(-7) function to reject 
the null hypothesis, to be conducted at the time of the PFS assessment. This analysis will have 
90% overall statistical power (two-sided alpha level of 0.05) to detect an OS hazard ratio of 0.77, 
assuming a median survival of capecitabine-treated patients of 15.2 months, corresponding to an 
improvement of approximate 30% in median survival. 

4.2 

INCLUSION CRITERIA 

Patients meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment into the study: 
1.  Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of breast adenocarcinoma that is now 

metastatic or locally recurrent and inoperable with curative intent (Appendix 1).  Patients with 
previously treated histo/cytologically confirmed disease who develop clinical or radiological 
evidence of metastatic disease do not require separate confirmation of the metastatic disease.

2.  All patients must have received an anthracycline and a taxane prior to entry in the protocol. 
These drugs may have been given in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant or in the metastatic setting, 
may have been given concurrently or sequentially, and may have been given in combination 
with other drugs. All patients must have received an anthracycline and a taxane (e.g. docetaxel 
and/or paclitaxel) prior to entry in the protocol. 

For taxanes 

a)  Patients must have progressed while receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel therapy or at any 

time after having received paclitaxel or docetaxel therapy.  

b)  The taxane-based treatment must have been the last chemotherapy the patient received.

Patients must have either: 

a)  Progressed while on anthracyclines treatment, with or without an initial response, 

OR 

b)  Patients must have received an adequate course of anthracyclines defined as follows: 

i. 

In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, patients must have received a regimen 
considered standard for adjuvant therapy, which would usually result in a 
cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 200-300 mg/m2 or doxorubicin equivalent. 

ii.  In the metastatic setting patients must have received a regimen considered standard 
for therapy for metastatic disease, which would usually result in a cumulative dose 
of doxorubicin of at least 300 mg/m2 or doxorubicin equivalent. 

3.  Completion of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy (including trastuzumab [Herceptin]), 

targeted non-cytotoxic therapy, and radiotherapy ≥3 weeks prior to randomization. Prior 
treatment with radiotherapy, chemoembolization therapy, or cryotherapy is allowed if these 
therapies did not affect the areas of measurable disease being used for the purposes of this 
protocol. Patients on bisphosphonate therapy may continue such therapy. 

4.  Evidence of measurable disease as defined by RECIST (Appendix 3). Measurable lesions are 

lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter 
≥ 20 mm with conventional CT.  With spiral CT scan, lesion must be ≥ 10 mm in at least one 
dimension. 

5.  Male or female patients at least 18 years old. 
6.  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0,1, or 2 (Appendix 2).

EXCLUSION CRITERIA 

21-Sep-2006 
Final 

Patients presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study: 
1.  History of any second malignancy with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or 

squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri. Inclusion of patients with 
any other in situ cancer, or a history of an invasive cancer with complete remission for 5 or 
more years must be discussed with the sponsor and the principal investigators. Patients with a 
history of contralateral breast cancer who have been disease-free for more than 5 years prior to 
randomization are permitted. 

2.  History of hypersensitivity grade ≥3 to taxanes, Polysorbate-80, or to compounds with similar 

chemical structures. Patients with known intolerance to fluoropyrimidines or patients with 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. 

3.  The following breast cancer treatments: 

•  Patients receiving >1 adjuvant regimen. However, patients who have received neoadjuvant 

therapy immediately followed by surgery and immediately followed by adjuvant therapy 
without intervening progression are considered to have received one adjuvant regimen and 
are allowed in the trial. It is not considered to be adjuvant treatment, when chemotherapy 
is administered after a local treatment by either surgery or radiotherapy of a single 
metastasis, including cutaneous metastases, since recurrence is a near certainty and not 
only a risk. 

•  Patients receiving >1 chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or locally recurrent and 

inoperable breast cancer. A chemotherapy regimen is defined as a single or a combination 
of chemotherapy agents given until documented disease progression or relapse. For 
example, patients who received sequential doxorubicin and docetaxel in the metastatic 
setting without intervening progression are allowed in the trial. 

4.  Prior treatment with capecitabine or any taxanes analogs except for paclitaxel or docetaxel 

(eg, epothilones are not permitted, novel preparations of paclitaxel are not permitted). Generic 
paclitaxel and Abraxane® (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) are permitted. 

5.  Concurrent treatment with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, erythromycin, clarythromycin or patients planning to receive these treatments. 
For patients who were receiving treatment with such agents, a one-week washout period is 
required prior to randomization. 

6.  Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial or with any other cancer therapy including 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy (including trastuzumab [Herceptin]), hormonal therapy, 
radiotherapy, chemoembolization therapy, cryotherapy, targeted non-cytotoxic therapies or 
patients planning to receive these treatments during the study. 

7.  HER-2 positive patients may participate in this trial. Concurrent treatment with trastuzumab 

[Herceptin] is not permitted. 

8.  Known brain or leptomeningeal disease (CT or MRI scan of the brain required only in case of 

clinical suspicion of central nervous system involvement).

9.  Any of the following within the 6 months prior to randomization: myocardial infarction, 

severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft surgery, clinically 
symptomatic and uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, or clinically significant cardiac 
arrhythmias (grade 3-4). 

10. History of inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea. 
11. Peripheral neuropathy grade ≥2. 
12. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or significant laboratory 

abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for the patient’s safety, 
inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with interpretation of study results, and in the 
judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. 

13. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection requiring treatment or acquired 

immunodeficiency-syndrome (AIDS)-related illness. 

14. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 

Any waiver of these inclusion and exclusion criteria must be approved by the investigator and the 
sponsor on a case-by-case basis prior to enrolling the patient. This must be documented by both 
the sponsor and the investigator. 

No patient will be allowed to enroll in this study more than once. 

4.4 

PATIENTS OF REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL 

Female patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding while enrolled in this study, as stated in 
the patient eligibility criteria. Absence of pregnancy must be demonstrated in patients of 
reproductive potential (ie, ovulating, pre-menopausal, not surgically sterile) by serum or urine 
prior to exposure to the investigational product or any study procedure with potential risk to the 
fetus. 

A patient must not become pregnant during the study. Female patients and female partners of 
male patients of reproductive potential must use a medically accepted contraceptive regimen. The 
contraceptive method(s) chosen should be medically, culturally, and geographically acceptable as 
well as proven to have an acceptably low failure rate, as determined by the investigator. 

Repeat pregnancy tests should be performed at the discretion of the investigator during the 
patient’s participation in the study to ensure that pregnancy has not occurred. Any pregnancy 
diagnosed in a female patient or in the female partner of a male patient during treatment with the 
study drugs RPR109881 or capecitabine, must be reported to the sponsor immediately and 
treatment with study drug will be permanently withdrawn. Information related to the pregnancy 
must be given on a “Drug Exposure Via Parent – Data Collection” form that will be provided by 
the sponsor and the medical management of the patient and the pregnancy will be determined on a 
case-by-case basis.

5.2  DOSAGE SCHEDULE 

5.2.1  RPR109881 treatment 

Patients randomized to the RPR109881 investigational treatment arm will receive a starting dose 
of 90 mg/m² IV RPR109881 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 administered over 1 hour, with the exception of 
patients with known bone marrow involvement, documented by bone marrow biopsy and/or 
aspiration, who will receive a starting dose of 75 mg/m² IV RPR109881 (Table 10). If bone 
marrow involvement is suspected, a bone marrow aspiration must be performed and documented 
during the Screening period. Treatments will be repeated in the same manner at 3-week intervals 
(3-week cycles). Dose adjustment will be permitted for subsequent treatment cycles based on 
individual patient tolerance. Treatment will continue unless any of the Withdrawal Criteria are 
met as described in Section 9.1.

Body surface area (BSA) will be calculated at the start of each treatment cycle from body weight 
in kg, recorded prior to the start of each treatment cycle, and height in cm, recorded at baseline. 
The preferred Dubois and Dubois equation is below: 

BSA in units of m2 = wgt. in kg 0.425 x hgt. in cm 0.725 x 0.007184 

Subjects with a BSA >2.1 m2 will use 2.1 m2 for the determination of RPR109881 dose.

Required premedication will include: dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg, diphenhydramine 25 mg or 
other antihistamines; dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent steroid. Ranitidine or other Histamine H2 
antagonist is recommended with the exception of cimetidine. All premedications will be 
administered by i.v. infusion.  It is recommended that infusion of these medications be completed 
30 minutes or more prior to each dose of RPR109881. Anti-emetic prophylaxis with ondansetron, 
granisetron or dolasetron is recommended. 

5.2.2  RPR109881 treatment modification 

Patients should be carefully monitored for toxicity. Dose modifications will be based on the worst 
toxicity and worst observed severity grade of the toxicity. The sponsor should be contacted for 
further guidance for patients requiring dosage reduction below 45 mg/m2 (-3 dose level). Dose 
reductions for RPR109881-associated toxicity will not be re-escalated even if the toxicity has 
resolved. 

The duration of treatment cycles must be at least 3 weeks, which will generally correspond to 21 
days. Under exceptional circumstances such as legal holidays, a –1/+3 days visit window is 
acceptable for scheduling purposes (ie, cycle length of 20-24 days). While the presence of toxicity 
may result in a protocol-mandated extension of the cycle to allow sufficient time for recovery, 
cycle shortening (less than 20 days) days is never permitted. 

Patients with bone marrow involvement who receive a starting dose of 75 mg/m2 will be eligible 
for a 1-level dose escalation (to 90 mg/m2) at the investigator’s discretion only if: 
•  ANC nadir from the cycle in which the patient received 75 mg/m2 RPR109881 was Gr ≤2 

(≥1000/µL) and the ANC on the expected day of retreatment is Gr ≤1 (≥1500/µL).

(≥50,000/µL) and the platelet count on the expected day of retreatment is ≥ 100,000/µL. 

•  No dose reduction recommendations apply. 

Unless otherwise noted in the following treatment modification sections below, patients will be 
allowed up to a 3-week delay in the start of a new treatment cycle in order for treatment-related 
toxicities to resolve. If, on the expected day of retreatment, the last tumor assessment was 
performed >6 weeks prior, consideration should be given to performing a tumor assessment 
before starting a new cycle of therapy. If the patient has not recovered sufficiently for retreatment 
within 3 weeks, contact the sponsor for guidance. 

5.2.2.1  Status of the patient on the day of planned retreatment 

In general, on the day of planned retreatment with RPR109881, patients must have resolution of 
all toxicities due to treatment (except alopecia) to grade ≤1 or baseline, if baseline was greater 
than grade 1. 

Specific requirements apply with respect to hematologic, hepatic, and neurosensory toxicities. 

5.2.2.2  Dose reduction based on maximal grade of toxicity in the previous cycle 

In general, for any otherwise unspecified toxicity, the following rules apply: 
• 

If maximal toxicities were grade ≤2 in the previous cycle, RPR109881 dose should be 
maintained. 
If maximal toxicities were grade ≥3 in the previous cycle, RPR109881 dose should be 
decreased by 1 dose level.  However, in case of grade ≥ 3 adverse events such as fatigue, 
anorexia, pain, and accidental injuries, the relevance of dose reduction is to be evaluated by 
the physician at site at time of the re-administration of RPR109881. 

• 

Specific dose reduction requirements apply with respect to hematologic, hepatic, and 
neurosensory toxicities. 

Hematologic toxicity 

CBC/differential and platelet counts should be obtained weekly to monitor the effects of 
chemotherapy. If grade 4 neutropenia, assess ANC every 3 days [-1/+0] until grade ≤1 (ANC 
≥1,500/µL). In case of grade ≥1 fever, CBC should be performed. The absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) must be ≥1500/µL and the platelet count must be ≥100,000/µL before the next cycle of 
study treatment is administered.  

RPR109881 treatment shall be modified for neutropenia (Table 11) and thrombocytopenia (Table 
12). The dose modifications based on neutropenia (Table 11) apply for patients who are not 
started on Granulocyte/Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (G/GM-CSF), or for 
patients experiencing neutropenia despite being treated with G/GM-CSF. If neutropenia or its

complications result in the initiation of G/GM-CSF for the subsequent cycle, this dose 
modification (Table 11) does not apply for the initial cycle with G/GM-CSF. 

No dose modification will be made for anemia; patients will be supported appropriately by the 
treating physician. If RPR109881 must be delayed due to hematologic toxicity, CBC/platelets will 
continue to be performed weekly, or more often if clinically indicated.

[-1/+0] until recovery to grade ≤1. 

 

Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with 
RPR109881. Neutropenic complications should be managed promptly with antibiotic support. 
Initial prophylactic administration of a colony-stimulating factor (CSF) is not advised, but 
physicians may wish to consider CSF use in individual patients having experienced neutropenic 
fever or infection with prior chemotherapeutic regimens. If possible, ASCO guidelines regarding 
use of growth factors should be followed [26]. 

On-study treatment with G/GM-CSF for patients experiencing significant neutropenia (eg, 
neutropenia grade 4 > 5 days; febrile neutropenia - neutropenia grade ≥3 with related fever grade 
≥1) and in patients with neutropenic infections may be started at that cycle, and prophylactic 
administration of G/GM-CSF should be considered for the subsequent cycles. If possible, ASCO 
guidelines regarding use of growth factors should be followed [26].

Non-hematologic toxicity 

If RPR109881 treatment shall be modified for non-hematologic toxicity as indicated in the text 
and tables below. If RPR109881 must be delayed due to non-hematologic toxicity, blood counts 
or other clinical assessments to monitor toxicity will be performed weekly, or more often if 
clinically indicated. 

Hepatic function 

At the day of planned retreatment with RPR109881, the following laboratory parameters must be 
met: 
•  For patients who entered the trial with AP ≤2.5 x ULN, ALT/AST/AP must all be grade ≤1 

(≤2.5 x ULN). 

•  For patients who entered the trial with AP >2.5-≤5.0 x ULN, ALT/AST must both be ≤1.5 x 

ULN and AP must be ≤5.0 x ULN. 

•  Bilirubin must be WNL. 

If the above criteria are not met on the planned day of retreatment, delay retreatment with 
RPR109881 for up to 3 weeks until toxicity resolves to the above parameters, then reduce the 
dose by 1 level and resume treatment. 

Renal toxicity 

No dose reduction for RPR109881 will be made for renal toxicity. However, treatment with 
RPR109881 will be delayed for up to 3 weeks if the serum creatinine is >1.5 x ULN or ≤60 
mL/min. Treatment may resume if the serum creatinine or calculated CrCl return to ≤1.5 x ULN 
or >60 mL/min, respectively. 

Neurologic toxicity 

RPR109881 treatment should be modified for neurologic toxicity as described in Table 13.

weeks, the patient should be withdrawn from study treatment.  

No further study treatment. 

 

Nausea and vomiting 

Nausea and/or vomiting should be controlled with adequate antiemetics. If grade 4 
nausea/vomiting occurs in spite of antiemetics, the RPR109881 dose should be reduced by 1 dose 
level for the next cycle. 

Mucositis 

If mucositis is present at the time of planned treatment, study treatment is delayed until recovery 
to grade ≤1. If acute grade 3-4 mucositis occurs at any time, the next RPR109881 dose should be 
reduced by 1 dose level and treatment resumed upon recovery. 

Diarrhea 

General Precautions: 

Diarrhea can be life threatening and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. 
Diarrhea should be treated promptly with loperamide.  Patients with diarrhea should be carefully 
monitored and should be given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. 

Diarrhea in the absence of neutropenia ≥ Grade 3: 

In addition to the general precautions, patients should be given antibiotic support if they develop 
ileus, fever or neutropenic complications. Subsequent chemotherapy treatments should be delayed 
in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without need for 
antidiarrhea medication. If grade 2, 3, or 4 diarrhea occurs, despite maximal antidiarrhea 
medication, subsequent doses of RPR109881 should be decreased by 1 dose level. 

Diarrhea ≥ Grade 3 associated with neutropenia ≥ Grade 3: 

In addition to prompt treatment with loperamide and fluid and electrolyte replacement, aggressive 
treatment with antibiotic support is recommended.  CBC should be assessed every 3 days [-1/+0] 
until ANC resolves to ≥ 1500/µL. Subsequent chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in such 
patients for up to 3 weeks until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without

need for antidiarrhea medication and until ANC resolves to ≥ 1500/µL. Following recovery, the 
dose of RPR109881 should be reduced by 1 level.   

Hypersensitivity reactions 

Description and suggested management of RPR109881 hypersensitivity reactions are found in 
Table 14. 

Table 14 - Interventions based on RPR109881 hypersensitivity reaction 

Symptom Severity 

Intervention Recommendation 

Mild symptoms: 
localized cutaneous reaction such as mild pruritus, flushing, 
rash 

Moderate symptoms: 
any symptom such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, 
dyspnea, back pain during infusion, hypotension with systolic 
blood pressure (BP) > 80 mm Hg not listed above (mild 
symptoms) or below (severe symptoms). 

Severe symptoms, such as: 
bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, systolic BP ≤ 80 mm 
Hg, angioedema 

•  Consider decreasing the rate of infusion until recovery of 

symptoms, stay at bedside, 

•  Then, complete RPR109881 infusion at the initial planned rate 
•  Stop RPR109881 infusion, 
•  Give diphenhydramine 50 mg IV and/or IV dexamethasone 10 

mg, 

•  Resume RPR109881 infusion within 3 hours following 

recovery of hypersensitivity reaction. Administer RPR109881 
over 2 hours for all subsequent treatments. 

•  Stop RPR109881 infusion; 
•  Give IV diphenhydramine 50 mg and/or IV 

dexamethasone 10 mg and/or epinephrine as needed. 
•  In case of severe hypersensitivity reaction, rechallenge 
must be performed more than 3 hours after recovery 
and premedication should be readministered. 

•  If severe reaction recurs despite additional 

premedication, the patient will go off protocol therapy. 

Anaphylaxis (Grade 4 reaction) 
 

NO FURTHER PROTOCOL THERAPY. 

Management of Subsequent Treatment Cycles: The recommended pretreatment for subsequent 
infusions is 50 mg diphenhydramine IV and 10 mg dexamethasone IV 30 minutes prior to 
RPR109881 infusion. For patients who experience moderate or severe hypersensitivity reactions, 
the RPR109881 should be administered over 2 hours for subsequent treatment courses in addition 
to premedication as noted above. These patients must be informed of the potential risk of 
recurrent allergic reactions and must be carefully monitored. 

If the initial reaction is grade 4 for Allergy, the patient will receive no further treatment and will 
go off protocol therapy. If a second severe reaction (grade 3) recurs despite additional 
premedications as outlined above, the patient will go off protocol therapy. 

In case of late occurring hypersensitivity symptoms, eg, appearance within 1 week after treatment 
of a localized or generalized pruritus, symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine). Additional oral or IV premedication with antihistamine may also be given for the

next cycle of treatment depending on the intensity of the reaction observed. No dose reductions 
will be made in any case. 

5.2.3  Capecitabine treatment 

Patients randomized to the capecitabine treatment arm will receive a starting dose of 1250 mg/m² 
capecitabine tablets administered orally twice daily (morning and evening, equivalent to 2500 
mg/m2 total daily dose) for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, to form a 3-week cycle. The 
dose is based on prescribing information stated in the US and EU package inserts. Dose 
adjustment will be permitted depending on individual patient tolerance. 

Body surface area (BSA) will be calculated at the start of each treatment cycle from body weight 
in kg, recorded prior to the start of each treatment cycle, and height in cm, recorded at baseline. 
The preferred Dubois and Dubois equation is below: 

BSA in units of m2 = wgt. in kg 0.425 x hgt. in cm 0.725 x 0.007184 

Capecitabine tablets should be swallowed with water within 30 minutes after a meal. Table 15 
displays the total daily dose by body surface area and the number of tablets to be taken at each 
dose.

5.2.4  Capecitabine treatment modification  

Dose modification of capecitabine for hematologic toxicity should follow guidance in Tables 16, 
18 and 19 below. Administration of capecitabine should be interrupted during a treatment cycle if 
grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity develops. The next treatment cycle cannot start until 
hematologic toxicity has recovered to grade ≤ 1.  

No dose reductions or interruptions are required for anemia as it can be managed by Erythropoetin 
treatment or RBC transfusion.

Dose modifications for non-hematologic toxicities will be based on the worst toxicity and worst 
observed severity grade of the toxicity (Table 17, Table 18, Table 19). Toxicity due to 
capecitabine administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment, dose interruptions, and 
adjustment of capecitabine dose. Dose reductions for capecitabine-associated toxicity will not be 
re-escalated even if the toxicity has resolved. Patients should withdraw from treatment if toxicity 
occurs despite administration of capecitabine at 50% of the Starting Dose. 

Unless otherwise noted in the following treatment modification sections below, patients will be 
allowed up to a 3-week delay in the start of a new treatment cycle in order for treatment-related 
toxicities to resolve. If, on the expected day of retreatment, the last tumor assessment was 
performed >6 weeks prior, consideration should be given to performing a tumor assessment

Dosage modifications are not recommended for grade 1 events. Therapy with capecitabine should 
be interrupted upon the occurrence of a grade 2 or 3 adverse experience. Once the adverse event 
has resolved or decreased in intensity to grade ≤1, then capecitabine therapy may be restarted at 
full dose or as adjusted according to the above table (Table 17). The doses corresponding to 75% 
and 50% dose levels are found in Table 18 and Table 19. If a grade 4 adverse event occurs, 
therapy should be discontinued or interrupted until resolved or decreased to grade 1, and therapy 
should be restarted at 50% of the original dose. Doses of capecitabine omitted for toxicity or any 
other reason are not replaced or restored; instead the patient should resume the planned treatment 
cycles. 

The duration of treatment cycles must be at least 3 weeks which will generally correspond to 21 
days. Under exceptional circumstances such as legal holidays, a –1/+3 days visit window is 
acceptable for scheduling purposes (ie, cycle length of 20-24 days). While the presence of toxicity 
may result in a protocol-mandated extension of the cycle to allow sufficient time for recovery, 
cycle shortening (less than 20 days) is never permitted.

Hand-and-foot syndrome 

Hand-and-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy-induced acral 
erythema) is a cutaneous toxicity (median time to onset of 79 days, range from 11 to 360 days) 
with a severity range of grades 1 to 3. Grade 1 is characterized by any of the following: 
numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless swelling or erythema of the hands and/or 
feet and/or discomfort which does not disrupt normal activities. Grade 2 hand-and-foot syndrome 
is defined as painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting 
the patient’s activities of daily living. Grade 3 hand-and-foot syndrome is defined as moist 
desquamation, ulceration, blistering or severe pain of the hands and/or feet and/or severe 
discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living. If 
grade 2 or 3 hand-and-foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabine should be interrupted 
until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 hand-and-foot 
syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. 

Hyperbilirubinemia 

If grade ≥2 drug-related elevations in bilirubin occur, administration of capecitabine should be 
immediately interrupted until the hyperbilirubinemia resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 
≤1. Dose modifications should be performed in accordance with Table 17. 

Renal impairment 

Dose adjustment is recommended as outlined in Table 17 if a patient develops a grade 2 to 4 
adverse event.

TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 

The study drugs, investigational product (RPR109881) and comparator (capecitabine), will be 
administered only to patients included in this study following the procedures set out in the clinical 
study protocol. The randomization will be performed using an Interactive Voice Response System 
(IVRS). 

After each patient has provided their written informed consent, patients will be assigned a unique 
8-digit number that will incorporate the center number as well as a patient identification number. 
After the patient has completed the necessary Screening assessments, and is deemed eligible for 
study entry by the principal investigator or designated individual, the study site will contact the 
Clinphone IVRS. The site will need to enter the following information regarding the clinical site 
and study patient: 
•  Patient’s 8-digit number (4-digit center number followed by 4-digit patient identification 

number) 

•  Patient’s initials 
•  Gender 
•  Date of birth

Final 

−  Adjuvant Treatment only 
−  Any Metastatic Disease with or without Adjuvant Treatment. Cancer which is locally 
recurrent and inoperable with curative intent should be considered metastatic for the 
process of stratification. 

For patients who received taxanes in both the adjuvant and metastatic setting, prior 
responsiveness is defined relative to the metastatic setting. 
•  Prior responsiveness to taxanes defined by: 

−  Refractory – disease progression at any time during taxane treatment or within the 30 days 

following the final dose of taxane. 

−  Non-refractory – disease progression 31 days or more after the final dose of taxane. 

Unblinded randomization to RPR109881 or capecitabine will be stratified based on treatment 
setting of the prior taxanes, prior responsiveness to taxanes, and region as defined below using a 
balancing algorithm. In order to minimize the predictability in the present open-label trial, a 
minimization approach with an allocation probability of 0.75 will be used to keep the balance 
between two treatment groups at each combination of the 3 stratification factors [27,28]. The 
regions are defined as follows: 

North America region: United States, Canada 

South America region: Mexico, South American countries 

Western Europe region: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greenland, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom 

Eastern Europe region: European countries not listed above 

Southern hemisphere: Australia, New Zealand, South Africa 

Rest of world: Countries not listed above 

The IVRS will assign the randomized treatment arm. Details of the IVRS procedure will be 
provided in the IVRS Site Manual. 

Study drug should begin on the same date as randomization. If not feasible, the maximum delay 
permitted for start of study drug is 3 working days after randomization. Clinical sites must 
complete the baseline case report forms (CRFs) for all randomized patients, even if the patient is 
not treated with study drug (RPR109881 or capecitabine). Patients who sign an informed consent 
but were not randomized are considered screen failures and must be documented as such in the 
CRF.

PACKAGING AND LABELING 

The investigational medicinal product (RPR109881) will be packaged by Aventis or one of its 
CROs and supplied on an open label basis. The comparator (Xeloda, capecitabine) will be 
supplied by Aventis as commercial pack over-labeled with a clinical supplies label. A copy of the 
Xeloda product information, appropriate for each participating country, will be provided in the 
Study Manual. 

5.4.1  Packaging of RPR109881 

5.4.1.1  RPR109881 80 mg/2 ml vial (concentrate for solution for infusion) 
•  Single-dose vial, containing a total of 94.4 mg of RPR109881 in 2.36 ml of polysorbate 80 

VG DF* at the concentration of 40 mg/ml of RPR109881. 
*Vegetable origin quality for safety improvement. 

•  The RPR109881 vial is a 15 mL clear glass vial stoppered and crimp-sealed with a dark blue 

flip-off aluminum cap. 

•  The volume of the concentrate for solution for infusion vial has been established and validated 
to compensate for loss during preparation of the premix due to foaming, adhesion to walls of 
the vial and dead space. This overfill ensures a minimal extractable volume of 8 mL 
containing 10 mg/mL RPR109881 following dilution with the solvent (premix). 

5.4.1.2  Solvent vial for RPR109881 
•  Solvent composition: 13% (w/w) ethanol in water for injection. 
•  The solvent vial is a 15 mL clear glass vial stoppered and crimp-sealed with a transparent flip-

off aluminum cap. 

•  The solvent vial contains 7.33 mL of solvent. This volume has been established and validated 

based on the total content of the RPR109881 concentrate for solution for infusion vial and 
ensures a concentration of 10 mg/mL RPR109881 after preparation of the premix. 

5.4.2  Packaging and dispensing of capecitabine 

Xeloda®, (capecitabine) will be supplied as commercial pack as follows:

5.4.5  Preparation and administration of RPR109881 

5.4.5.1  Preparation of the premix and infusion 

RPR109881 vial should be administered only by the intravenous route, either by peripheral vein 
or central venous catheter. The preparation of infusion solution is indicated below: 

Preparation of the premix under aseptic conditions 
1.  Remove the required number of RPR109881 vials from the refrigerator. The refrigerated 
solution may be hazy. The haziness disappears at room temperature. Consequently, it is 
necessary to stand the vials at room temperature (at least 60 minutes) until the solution clears. 

2.  Take the required number of solvent vials (one solvent vial for each RPR109881 vial).

Final 

3.  Using a syringe fitted with a needle, withdraw THE ENTIRE CONTENTS of the solvent 

vial. (Taking into account the overfill adopted for the RPR109881 and solvent vials, the 
addition of THE ENTIRE CONTENTS of one solvent vial to one RPR109881 vial ensures 
an extractable volume of 8 ml of premix containing 10 mg of RPR109881 per mL). 

4.  Using the same syringe and needle, pierce the stopper of the RPR109881 vial and into it inject 

THE ENTIRE CONTENTS of the solvent vial from the syringe. 

5.  Remove the syringe and needle and shake the mixture manually for at least 15 seconds. 
6.  Allow the premix solution to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature and then check that the 

solution is homogeneous and clear. (It is normal for foam to persist after this rest period). 

The premix obtained contains 10 mg of RPR109881 per mL. 

Preparation of the infusion under aseptic conditions 

WARNING:  Since foam is normally present, the required dose must be accurately 

adjusted using a graduated syringe. 

1.  Using a graduated syringe fitted with a needle, pierce the stopper of the vial and, holding the 

vial inverted, remove the volume of premix (containing 10 mg of RPR109881 per mL) 
corresponding to the required dose for administration (in mg of RPR109881). 

2.  Inject the premix volume, so removed, into a 250 mL or 500 mL PVC free infusion bag 
(containing either 5% glucose solution for injection or 0.9% sodium chloride solution for 
injection). The concentration of the infusion solution must never be higher than 0.75 mg/mL. 
Therefore, the maximum amount of RPR109881 added to a 250 mL infusion container should 
not exceed 200 mg (or 20 mL of the premix solution). If more than 200 mg of RPR109881 is 
required, a larger volume of infusion vehicle (ie, 500 mL) should be used so as not to exceed 
the concentration limit of 0.75 mg/mL of RPR109881. 

3.  Mix the contents of the infusion container manually using a rocking motion. 

Infusion conditions (normal lighting conditions) 

5.4.5.2 
When preparation of the infusion solution is finished, the infusion of RPR109881 should be 
completed (end of infusion) within 8 hours. 
• 

Infusion bags and infusion administration set made of PVC free or DEHP free material 
should be used. A glass bottle could also be used. 
In line filter (with a recommended pore size of 0.22 µm) made of PVC free or DEHP free 
material should be used. 

• 

5.4.5.3  Storage period of premix and infusion solution 

Since stability studies are not completed, the premix solution of RPR109881 should not be stored. 

The infusion solution is stable for 8 hours from preparation to end of infusion.

5.4.5.4  Recommendation for the safe handling 
•  RPR109881 is an antineoplastic agent and, like other potentially toxic compounds, caution 
should be exercised in handling and preparing RPR109881 solutions. The use of gloves is 
recommended. 
If RPR109881 concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with 
skin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If RPR109881 concentrate, 
premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with water. 

• 

5.4.5.5  Disposal 
•  All materials that have been utilized for dilution and administration should be disposed of 

according to standard procedures. 

5.5 

SUPPLIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY 

The investigator or pharmacist will inventory and acknowledge receipt of all shipments of the 
study drugs, investigational product (RPR109881) and comparator (capecitabine). The study 
drugs must be kept in a locked area with restricted access. The study drugs must be stored and 
handled in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The investigator or pharmacist will 
also keep accurate records of the dates and quantities of the study drugs dispensed, used, and 
returned by each patient, and destroyed. The study monitor will periodically check the supplies of 
study drugs held by the investigator or pharmacist to verify accountability of all study drugs used. 
At the conclusion of the study, all unused study drugs and all medication containers will be 
destroyed at the investigational site (at a locally authorized facility) according to local regulation 
unless other arrangements have been approved by the sponsor. Destruction of unused vials will 
occur only after drug accountability has been performed or written permission for destruction has 
been obtained from the study monitor. Used medication containers may be destroyed during the 
conduct of the study if required by the institution. The sponsor will verify that a final report of 
drug accountability to the unit dose level is prepared and maintained in the investigator study file. 

Drug vials must not be used outside the frame of this protocol. 

5.6  COMPLIANCE 

Administration of the study drugs, investigational drug (RPR109881) and comparator 
(capecitabine) will be supervised by the investigator or subinvestigator. Any delegation of this 
responsibility must follow Section 12.2. 

The person responsible for drug dispensing is required to maintain adequate records of all study 
drugs. The fixed labels and the tear off parts of the vials, bottles, or blister packs administered or 
dispensed to patients must be completed (subject number, and date of infusion , respectively). The 
tear off parts must be maintained by the site and data will be transcribed onto the CRF. The lot 
number of investigational drug (RPR109881 and solvent) and comparator (capecitabine) must be 
recorded in the CRF.

Final 

The person responsible for drug administration to the patient will record precisely the date the 
drug is administered to the patient. Interruption of the 1-hour RPR109881 infusion or 14-day 
course of capecitabine along with reason for the interruption will be recorded in the CRF. 

Patients will be instructed to bring their unused capecitabine at the time of resupply. For patients 
administered capecitabine in blister-packs and bottles packaged as one-cycles worth, this will 
occur at the end of each treatment cycle. Compliance will be assessed by tablet counts. For 
patients who are dispensed two-cycles worth of capecitabine in bottles only, a patient diary to 
record capecitabine administration will be kept. The diary will be reviewed at the end of each 
treatment cycle for compliance, and the tablets will be counted at the time of re-supply. Details 
will be recorded in the CRF.

PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND TREATMENTS 

6.1 

PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES 

Additional illnesses present at the time informed consent is given are regarded as concomitant 
illnesses and must be documented in the CRF. Relevant past illnesses must also be documented in 
the CRF. 

Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study, and worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study, are to be regarded as adverse events and must be documented as such in the CRF 
(see Section 8). 

6.2 

PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT TREATMENTS 

All treatments being taken by the patient on entry to the study or at any time during the study in 
addition to the investigational product are regarded as concomitant treatments and must be 
documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF. 

Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study. However, if these are 
considered necessary for the patient's welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the investigational 
product, they may be given at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the CRF. 

The following concomitant treatments are not permitted during this study: 
•  Concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs. 
•  Concurrent treatment with any other anticancer therapy including immunotherapy, targeted 

therapy or biological therapies. 
Initial prophylactic use of growth factors except for erythropoietin. 

• 
•  Concurrent treatment with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, erythromycin, clarythromycin. For patients who were receiving treatment with 
such agents, a one-week washout period is required prior to randomization. 

The following concomitant treatments should be administered with caution during this 
study: 
•  For both arms, due to drug interaction with warfarin, when oral anticoagulants are 
necessary, it is recommended to use low molecular weight heparin rather than warfarin.  
However, if treatment with coumadin-derivative is needed, INR should be closely monitored. 

•  Capecitabine Treatment Arm: 

−  The dose of phenytoin and the dose of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants may need to be 

reduced when either drug is administered concomitantly.

•  RPR109881 Treatment Arm: 

21-Sep-2006 
Final 

− 

−  Coumarin-derivative anticoagulant inhibits the oxidative metabolism of RPR109881 in 

vitro. If the patient requires a coumarin-derivative anticoagulant, the drug should be given 
2 hours or more after the end of infusion of the RPR109881. Monitoring of the 
coagulation factors or INR (International Normalized Ratio) is required. 
If acetaminophen (paracetamol) is required, it should be administered 2 h or more before 
the start of the infusion with RPR109881 or 2 h or more after the end of infusion of the 
RPR109881. Due to the possibility of an interaction between acetaminophen 
(paracetamol) and RPR109881 co-administered within this time window, the drug 
administrator must inquire if the patient has received acetaminophen (paracetamol) prior 
to administering RPR109881. 

−  Concurrent treatment with potent inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4, such as the 

antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. 

The following concomitant treatments are permitted during this study: 
•  G/GM-CSF administration will be permitted for the treatment of severe neutropenia at the 

discretion of the investigator. If possible, the ASCO guidelines regarding use of growth 
factors should be followed [26]. 

•  Capecitabine can induce diarrhea, sometimes severe. Patients with severe diarrhea should be 
carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. 
Standard antidiarrheal treatments (eg, loperamide) are recommended. 

•  Bisphosphonate therapy. 
•  Palliative radiotherapy may be given for control of pain for palliative intents. The sponsor 

should be notified to obtain prior approval prior to treatment if palliative radiotherapy is being 
considered, and prior to resuming therapy on the study. 

•  The irradiated area should be as small as possible and should never involve more than 20% of 

the bone-marrow in any given 3-week period. In all such cases, the possibility of tumor 
progression should be ruled out by physical, biological and radiological assessments of the 
tumor. If the only evaluable lesions are to be irradiated, the patient will be removed from the 
study. The irradiated area cannot be used as a parameter for response assessment. Treatment 
with RPR109881 and radiation therapy should not be given concurrently. 

•  Supportive treatment as medically indicated for the patient’s well-being may be prescribed at 

the investigator’s discretion. Every medication or treatment taken by the patient during the 
trial and the reason for its administration must be recorded on the CRF. 

•  Use of erythropoietin for chemotherapy-related anemia.

•  EORTC QLQ-30 and BR-23 Quality of Life Questionnaires* 

7.2.2  Study days 

The period called Study Days begins when the patient receives the initial dose of study drug 
(Cycle 1 Day 1). Each cycle consists of 21 days and assessments are scheduled on a weekly basis 
(Day 1, Day 8, Day 15) but may be repeated more often, as clinically indicated. Cycle lengths 
may be extended if additional time is required for resolution of study drug-related toxicities or 
other adverse events, but cycle shortening to less than 20 days is never permitted. A maximum 3-
week delay for resolution of study drug-related toxicities is allowed. Beyond this, the sponsor 
should be contacted for guidance. In the case of treatment delay, safety assessments (eg, 
laboratory assessments) should continue, minimally, at the frequency outlined in the Study 
Schedule for the cycle in which the delay took place. A patient diary will be provided to patients 
who are dispensed capecitabine in bottles Patients who are dispensed capecitabine in blister packs 
will have the packs analyzed and will not require a diary. 

If the assessment is scheduled for a day in which the patient is also scheduled to receive study 
drug, the assessment must be performed prior to the study drug administration unless otherwise 
indicated in the Study Schedule and not precluding additional assessments where necessary, eg, 
monitoring and recording any adverse events during and after study drug treatment. 

7.2.2.1  Cycle 1 Day 1 

• 

IVRS Randomization after review of the Screening assessments and the patient is deemed 
eligible for study entry. 

Typically, randomization will occur on Cycle 1 Day 1 which is defined as the day the patient 
receives the initial dose of study drug. If this is not possible due to scheduling conflicts, site 
holidays, or other unforeseen circumstances, the maximum delay between randomization and the 
start of study medication is 3 working days. 
•  All assessments indicated in “Day 1 of Each Cycle” below 

On Cycle 1 Day 1 only, the required assessment may be omitted if an acceptable screening 
assessment was performed within 5 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 

7.2.2.2  Day 1 of each cycle 

Day 1 of each cycle is dictated by the day the patient receives the first dose of study drug for any 
given cycle. For all cycles of treatment, the Day 1 assessment has a [-1/+0] window except as 
otherwised specified below, meaning that the assessment may be performed 1 day prior to Day 1, 
on Day 1, but not after Day 1.

be performed and assessed. The Cycle 6 assessment must be performed on Day 120, whenever 
possible. 

For patients with bone disease at Screening, repeat scans must be performed at the end of all 
even-numbered treatment cycles (eg, Cycles 2, 4, 6, etc.) Days 15-21 inpatients experiencing new 
or worsening bone symptoms or at the end of every 4th treatment cycle (eg, Cycles 4, 8, 12, 
etc.)Days 15-21 in patients not experiencing new or worsening bone symptoms. Bone scans are 
not necessary if there exists clear objective evidence of progression by other assessments in sites 
other than bone.

For patients with previously documented positive bone marrow who achieve a complete response, 
please contact the sponsor with respect to the need for repeat aspiration. 

7.2.2.6  Day 120 

The Day 120 assessment has a (+/-7 days) window, ie, Day 113-Day 127. If the end-of-even-
numbered-cycle tumor assessment for retreatment is performed within the Day 120 window, then 
one set of scans will suffice for both purposes. 
•  Tumor Assessment: CT Scan 
•  Body weight and ECOG performance status 

7.2.3  End of study (treatment) / withdrawal 

All patients must continue to be observed for 30 days after the final dose of study treatment as 
follows: 

At the end of the study treatment, the following procedures should be performed within the 22-30 
days following the final dose of study drug. 
•  Physical Examination [complete neurological exam (both treatment arms), vital signs (heart 

rate, blood pressure, temperature) body weight, and ECOG performance status] 

•  Hematology, Blood Chemistry 
•  Tumor Assessment: CT Scan (if not performed within the prior 6 weeks) and Bone Scan (if 

not performed within the prior 6 weeks for patients experiencing new or worsening bone 
symptoms, or within the prior 12 weeks for patients with positive bone scan at Screening who 
are not experiencing new or worsening bone symptoms). Bone scans are not necessary if there 
exists clear objective evidence of progression by other assessments in sites other than bone. 

•  Assessment of Adverse Events 
•  Assessment of Concomitant Treatments 
•  Drug Accountability (capecitabine only) 
•  EORTC QLQ-30 and BR23 Quality of Life Questionnaires

Final 

During this period, the outcome of adverse events with a date of onset during the study period 
should be re-evaluated, and any new adverse events should be recorded. Serious adverse events 
should be followed as described in Sections 8.1.2, 8.2, and 8.4 of the protocol. 

7.2.4  Follow-up 

7.2.4.1  Adverse events 

All patients who have adverse events, whether considered associated with the use of the 
investigational products or not, must be monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course 
of the adverse event will be followed up according to accepted standards of medical practice, even 
after the end of the period of observation, until a satisfactory explanation is found or the 
investigator considers it medically justifiable to terminate follow-up. Should the adverse event 
result in death, a full pathologist’s report should be supplied, if possible. 

If the investigator detects a serious adverse event in a study patient after the end of the period of 
observation, and considers the event possibly related to prior study treatment, he or she should 
contact the sponsor to determine how the adverse event should be documented and reported. 

7.2.4.2  Post-study therapy, disease status, and survival 

After withdrawal from study treatment, further treatment, if any, is at the discretion of the 
investigator. Please note that in the absence of PD or of symptoms requiring anti-cancer 
treatment, follow-up without such treatment should be considered.  

Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression will continue to have tumor 
assessments every 6 weeks until disease progression.  For patients with bone disease at Screening, 
repeat bone scans will continue every 6 weeks in patients experiencing new or worsening bone 
symptoms or every 12 weeks in patients not experiencing new or worsening bone symptoms. 
Bone scans are not necessary if there exists clear objective evidence of progression by other 
assessments in sites other than bone. Additionally, tumor assessments will be performed as 
necessary according to RECIST to confirm response (PR/CR) and/or to document progression. 

Following documented disease progression, patients will be contacted every 3 months to 
document subsequent anti-cancer treatment and survival. 

7.2.4.3  Quality of life 

The QLQ-30/BR23 questionnaires should continue to be completed every 6 weeks by the patient 
either in the clinic if the patient is returning for reasons other than questionnaire completion, or by 
completion of the questionnaires at the patient’s home and return by mail until one of the 
following three scenarios: 
•  Progression 
• 
•  Death

Initiation of another anticancer therapy 

7.3  METHODS 

7.3.1  Efficacy data 

At baseline, all known and suspected sites of disease should be imaged using optimal techniques, 
including, but not limited to, CT scan (unless CT contrast is contraindicated) of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis and bone scan. To ensure comparability, the imaging methods utilized at 
baseline should be performed in subsequent assessments using identical techniques (ie, scans 
performed immediately following bolus contrast administration using a standard volume of 
contrast, to identical contrast agent, and preferably the same scanner). Chest X-ray for the 
purposes of efficacy assessment is discouraged. Ultrasound and PET may only be utilized as a 
diagnostic or screening tool, not for purposes of assessing efficacy. Whenever possible, clinical 
evaluation of superficial lesions should not be used as the sole form of measurement. However, 
when necessary, color photograph with metric caliber is acceptable. 

For imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, use of CT is strongly encouraged. In cases where 
CT contrast is contraindicated, MRI may be utilized. When available, spiral CT acquisition should 
be done. Slice thickness should be adapted to the anatomical area and presumed size of the 
lesions. If limitations appear in volume acquisition, it is encouraged to choose a 1,5 pitch and thin 
slices, rather than a 1 pitch with thick slices. A centimeter scale should appear on films. 
Measurable disease as defined by RECIST requires the presence of at least one measurable target 
lesion at baseline. As stated in RECIST, the minimum size of the lesion should be no less than 
double the slice thickness of the CT reconstruction. 

The determination of antitumor efficacy will be based on objective tumor assessments made 
according to the RECIST system of unidimensional evaluation (Appendix 3) and treatment 
decisions by the investigator will be based on these assessments. For the purpose of analysis, a 
CR or PR will be deemed a confirmed response if a subsequent assessment has been performed at 
least 4 weeks after the first assessment and the results confirm the initial finding. Of note, lesions 
in previously irradiated fields cannot be used for the determination of response but can be used for 
the determination of progression. Tumor markers will not be used in the assessment of response. 
For patients with previously documented positive bone marrow who achieve a complete response, 
please contact the sponsor with respect to the need for repeat aspiration.

Final 

All patients’ files and radiological images must be available for source verification of patient data. 
Copies of all images of patients must be made available for independent review within 1 week of 
completion of imaging studies. 

A charter for the independent review of imaging studies will describe the details of the 
independent review. The review will be blinded with respect to site, treatment assignment, and 
local interpretation of the imaging studies by independent radiologists. 

7.3.1.1  Summary of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 

Measurability of tumor lesions 

At Screening, tumor lesions will be categorized by the investigator as measurable or non-
measurable by RECIST as described below. 

Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is 
restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.  

Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
longest diameter ≥20 mm with conventional CT.  With spiral CT scan, lesion must be ≥10 mm in 
at least one dimension. 

Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 20 mm 
with conventional techniques or < 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and other non-measurable lesions.  
These include: bone lesions; leptomeningeal disease; ascites; pleural / pericardial effusion; 
inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitis cutis / pulmonis; abdominal masses that are not 
confirmed and followed by imaging techniques; and cystic lesions. 

All measurements should be recorded in metric notation by use of a ruler or calipers. All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 

In the present study, lesions in previously irradiated fields cannot be used for the determination of 
response but can be used for the determination of progression. 

Methods of measurements 

The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 

Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g. skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography 
-including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion- is recommended. 

Lesions on chest X-ray are not acceptable as measurable target lesions. CT is required.

Final 

CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions 
selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with 
contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm. 

Ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions that are clinically not easily 
accessible. It may be used as a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial 
palpable nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination. 

Tumor markers will not be used in the assessment of response. 

Tumor response evaluation 

Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” lesions 

All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded 
and measured at baseline. 

Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and 
their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). 

A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the 
objective tumor response. 

All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required but the presence or absence of each should 
be noted throughout follow-up. 

Response Criteria 

Evaluation of target lesions 

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. 

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD. 

Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references 
the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new 
lesions. 

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.

Final 

Evaluation of non target lesions 

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. 

Incomplete Response / Stable Disease: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s). 

Progression (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non-target lesions.  

Evaluation of best overall response 

The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). In general the patient's best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. The overall assessment of 
response will involve all parameters as depicted in Table 20.

Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.  

In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the 
complete response status. 

Frequency of tumor re-evaluation 

In the present study, tumor will be re-evaluated every 6 weeks during treatment, and at least 4 
weeks after the first observation of a complete or partial response. After discontinuation of 
protocol treatment, patients who have not progressed will still be re-evaluated every 6 weeks, 
unless they have started a new anti-cancer therapy.

Confirmatory measurements  

Confirmation 

21-Sep-2006 
Final 

The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to minimize the risk of overestimation of 
the response rate.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear 
when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. In the present 
study, responses always need to be confirmed. 

To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response 
are first met. Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol may also be appropriate. In the 
present study, any interval equal of longer than 4 weeks is appropriate, but it is recommended to 
use a 6 weeks interval. 

In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study 
entry at a minimum interval defined in the protocol. In the present study, this interval is 35 days. 

7.3.2  Safety data 

7.3.2.1  Adverse events 

Safety profile based on incidence, severity (as graded by the NCI CTCAE, version 3.0), 
chronicity, and cumulative nature of treatment-emergent adverse events. Each patient will be 
assessed preferably by the same physician for potential adverse events according to the NCI CTC 
classification. 

The NCI CTCAE will be provided in the Study Manual, or alternatively may be accessed through 
the NCI website at http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html. 

7.3.2.2  Laboratory measurements

7.3.2.3  Clinical examination 

Physical examination: A physical examination including, but not limited to, general appearance, 
skin, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, breast, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, 
and nervous system (both treatment arms)* will be performed. The physical examination will 
include examination of known and suspected sites of disease. Height will be recorded at baseline 
only. Body weight will also be recorded at the start of each treatment cycle. 
* Neurological Examination will minimally include assessment of the following: 
•  History: paresthesia (numbness, tingling), dysesthesia, constipation, weakness, somnolence, 

confusion, disorientation, dizziness, memory loss, incoordination, hallucinations, seizure, 
visual disturbance, taste change, fainting. 

•  Exam: mental status, strength of extremities, gait, extra-ocular movements, tongue, sensory-
touch including face, coin recognition, deep tendon reflexes, finger-nose test. More focused 
exam based on History as necessary. 

Performance Status: The ECOG scale will be used (Appendix 2). Every attempt should be made 
to have the same individual perform the assessment throughout the study for any given patient for 
consistency of grading. 

Vital signs: Measurements will be made of sitting pulse, temperature, and blood pressure after 5 
minutes of rest. 

ECG: A 12 lead (with a 10 second rhythm strip) will be used for all ECGs. It is preferable that the 
machine used has a capacity to calculate the standard intervals automatically.

Not applicable for this study. 

7.3.4  Pharmacodynamic data 

Not applicable for this study. 

7.3.5  Quality-of-life data 

The QLQ-C30 profile questionnaire and QLQ-BR23 module specific to breast cancer are, 
respectively, 30 and 23 items in a questionnaire format. They will be self-administered by the 
patient (see Appendix 4 and 5) and should be completed within the 7 days prior to randomization, 
Day 1 every treatment cycle (except the first cycle), and at the End of Study/Withdrawal visit. For 
as long as the patient is being followed for other protocol measures, the QLQ-30-BR23 
questionnaires should continue to be completed by the patient either in the clinic, if the patient is 
returning for reasons other than questionnaire completion, or by completion of the questionnaires 
at the patient’s home and returned by mail every 6 weeks until progression, initiation of another 
anticancer therapy, or death.

Final 

On days in which treatment with study drug is scheduled, the patient should complete the 
questionnaire at the center just prior to treatment except for the first cycle. 

It is recommended that a key person (eg, research nurse) at each center should be responsible for 
questionnaire data collection in order to optimize the compliance of the patient and to ensure the 
completeness of the data. 

7.3.6  Health economic data 

EQ-5D should be completed within the 7 days prior to randomization, Day 1 every odd treatment 
cycle (except the first cycle), and at the End of Study/Withdrawal visit. For as long as the patient 
is being followed for other protocol measures, the EQ-5D questionnaire should continue to be 
completed by the patient either in the clinic, if the patient is returning for reasons other than 
questionnaire completion, or by completion of the questionnaires at the patient’s home and 
returned by mail every 6 weeks until progression, initiation of another anticancer therapy, or 
death. 

Inpatient resource utilization data will be collected on Day 1 every odd treatment cycle (except 
the first cycle), and at the End of Study (Treatment)/Withdrawal visit.

ADVERSE EVENTS 

8.1  DEFINITIONS 

8.1.1  Adverse event 

The term adverse event covers any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or 
illness that develops or worsens during the period of observation in the clinical study. Clinically 
relevant abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., 
requiring unscheduled diagnostic procedures or treatment measures, or resulting in withdrawal 
from the study) are considered to be adverse events. 

Worsening of a sign or symptom of the condition under treatment will normally be measured by 
efficacy parameters. However, if the outcome fulfils the definition of “serious adverse event”, it 
must be recorded as such (see Section 8.1.2). 

The adverse event may be: 
•  A new illness 
•  Worsening of a concomitant illness 
•  An effect of the study medication, including comparator 
•  A combination of two or more of these factors 

No causal relationship with the study medication or with the clinical study itself is implied by the 
use of the term “adverse event”. 

Adverse events fall into the categories “non serious” and “serious” (see Section 8.1.2). 

Surgical procedures themselves are not adverse events; they are therapeutic measures for 
conditions that require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an adverse 
event, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by 
the clinical study protocol and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not adverse events, if 
the condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment. In the latter case the 
condition should be reported as medical history. 

8.1.2  Serious adverse event 

A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose): 
•  Results in death 
• 
•  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 

Is life-threatening1 

Property of the sanofi-aventis group - strictly confidential 

Page 82 

Amended Clinical Study Protocol 4 
EFC6089 [XRP9881B/3001] - Larotaxel 
•  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2 
• 
• 

Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Is an important medical event3 

21-Sep-2006 
Final 

1“Life-threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious 
adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe. 

2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 

3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred. Important medical 
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. A diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be 
considered as medically important. The List of Critical Terms (1998 adaptation of WHO Adverse 
Reaction Terminology Critical Terms List, provided in the “Instructions for completing the 
‘Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial’ form”) should be used as 
guidance for adverse events that may be considered serious because they are medically important. 

Clarification of the difference in meaning between “severe” and “serious” 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based 
on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or 
functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations. 

8.1.3  Alert terms and other reasons for expedited reporting to Pharmacovigilance 

No special events are subject to reporting as alert terms in this study. 

However, cases in which a “significant overdose” of RPR109881 was taken and a non-serious 
adverse event or no adverse event occurred are to be reported to the sponsor in an expedited 
manner on a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form. 

For the purposes of this study, a significant overdose is defined as: 

Single RPR109881 dose ≥105 mg/m2. 

In addition, any pregnancy diagnosed in a female patient or in the female partner of a male patient 
during treatment with RPR109881 or capecitabine must be reported to the sponsor immediately.

Information related to the pregnancy must be given on a “Drug Exposure Via Parent – Data 
Collection” form that will be provided by the sponsor. 

8.2 

PERIOD OF OBSERVATION 

For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of adverse events extends 
from the start of treatment with study drug (investigational agent or comparator) until 30 days 
after the final dose of study drug. 

If the investigator detects a serious adverse event in a study patient after the end of the period of 
observation, and considers the event possibly related to prior study treatment, he or she should 
contact the sponsor to determine how the adverse event should be documented and reported. 

8.3  DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS BY INVESTIGATOR 

All adverse events that occur during the observation period set in this protocol (see Section 8.2) 
must be documented on the pages provided in the CRF in accordance with the instructions for the 
completion of adverse event reports in clinical studies. These instructions are provided in the 
investigator’s study file and/or in the CRF itself. 

The following approach will be taken for documentation: 
•  All adverse events (whether serious or non-serious, or considered as an alert term) must be 

documented on the “Adverse Event” page of the CRF. 

•  For the purposes of this study, blood abnormalities must be recorded on the AE CRF page if:  

a.  the laboratory abnormality is serious, or 

b.  the laboratory abnormality results in withdrawal from study, or 

c. 

the laboratory abnormality results in dose reduction or treatment delay 

• 

If the adverse event is serious (see Section 8.1.2), the investigator must complete, in addition 
to the “Adverse Event” page in the CRF, a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a 
Clinical Trial” form at the time the serious adverse event is detected. This form must be sent 
to the study monitor who will forward it to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department. 
Complete contact information for the study monitor will be provided in the Investigator Study 
File. 

•  When a “significant overdose” of RPR109881 occurs without an adverse event, the 

investigator should only complete a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical 
Trial” form. Instructions on where to send this form will be provided by the sponsor. In this 
case, there is no need to complete the “Adverse Event” page in the CRF. 

Every attempt should be made to describe the adverse event in terms of a diagnosis. If a clear 
diagnosis has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded unless they 
represent atypical or extreme manifestations of the diagnosis, in which case they should be

Final 

reported as separate events. If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom 
must be recorded individually. 

All patients who have adverse events, whether considered associated with the use of the 
investigational products or not, must be monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course 
of the adverse event will be followed up according to accepted standards of medical practice, even 
after the end of the period of observation, until a satisfactory explanation is found or the 
investigator considers it medically justifiable to terminate follow-up. Should the adverse event 
result in death, a full pathologist’s report should be supplied, if possible. 

All questions on the completion and supply of adverse event report forms and any further forms 
issued to the investigator at a later date to clarify unresolved issues should be addressed to the 
sponsor. 

8.4 

IMMEDIATE REPORTING BY INVESTIGATOR TO SPONSOR 

Serious adverse events and adverse events that fulfill a reason for expedited reporting to 
Pharmacovigilance (“significant overdose”, as defined in Section 8.1.3) must be documented on a 
“Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form in accordance with the 
“Instructions for completing the ‘Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial’ 
form”. This form must be completed and supplied to the sponsor within 24 hours, or at the latest 
on the following working day. The “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical 
Trial” form and the instructions are provided in the investigator’s study file. 

The investigator should also inform the study monitor in all cases by telephone and by faxing a 
copy of the SAE report. The sponsor will ensure that all legal reporting requirements are met. 
Complete contact information for the study monitor will be provided in the Investigator Study 
File. 

The initial report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and 
(serious) adverse event, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the 
study drugs (investigational product or comparator). 

Information not available at the time of the initial report (eg, an end date for the adverse event or 
laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow-up “Serious Adverse 
Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form. 

The “Instructions for completing the ‘Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical 
Trial’ form” give more detailed guidance on the reporting of serious adverse events, adverse 
events that comply with alert terms, and adverse events initially reported as non-serious that 
become serious. In the latter situation, when a non-serious event becomes serious, details must be 
forwarded immediately to the sponsor on a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a 
Clinical Trial” form.

9  WITHDRAWALS 

9.1  WITHDRAWAL OF PATIENTS 

Withdrawal from Study 

Patients must be withdrawn from the study (ie, from any further study medication or study 
procedure) for the following reasons: 
•  At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative.* 
• 

If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the patient's 
well-being. 

•  At the specific request of the sponsor. 
•  Patient is lost to follow-up. 

Withdrawal from Study Treatment 

Patients must be withdrawn from study treatment (RPR109881 or capecitabine) under the 
following circumstances but will continue to be assessed and followed in the study unless any of 
the Withdrawal from Study criteria apply: 
•  At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative.* 
•  RECIST-defined disease progression, unless there is strong evidence of clinical benefit to 
justify continuation of dosing with study medication on protocol and this decision must be 
reviewed with the sponsor. 

•  Unacceptable toxicity. 
•  Need for other anticancer therapy not specified in the protocol or surgery or radiotherapy to 

the only site(s) of disease being evaluated in this protocol. 

•  Pregnancy 

In all cases, the reason for and date of withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the patient's 
medical records. The patient must be followed up to establish whether the reason was an adverse 
event, and, if so, this must be reported in accordance with the procedures in Section 8. 

As far as possible, all examinations scheduled for the final study day (End of Study/Withdrawal 
visit) must be performed on all patients who receive study drug (investigational product or 
comparator) but do not complete the study according to protocol. Refer to Section 7.2.3. 

The investigator must make every effort to contact patients lost to follow-up. Attempts to contact 
such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates and times of 
attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter).

10  EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 

10.1  EMERGENCY SPONSOR CONTACT 

In emergency situations, the investigator should contact the sponsor by telephone at the number 
given on the title page of the protocol. 

10.2  EMERGENCY IDENTIFICATION OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS 

This section is not applicable as this is an open-label study. 

10.3  EMERGENCY TREATMENT 

During and after a patient's participation in the trial, the investigator and/or institution should 
ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a patient for any adverse events, including 
clinically significant laboratory values, related to the trial. The investigator and/or institution 
should inform a patient when medical care is needed for intercurrent illness(es) of which the 
investigator becomes aware. 

10.4  RPR109881 EXTRAVASATION PROCEDURES 

Care should be taken to avoid extravasation of the drug outside of the vein when using 
RPR109881. If extravasation occurs or is suspected, the intravenous infusion should be stopped 
immediately. An attempt should be made to aspirate any extravasated drug through the needle in 
the vein. The needle should then be removed. Chemotherapy extravasation procedures utilized by 
the treating institution may be employed. 

Drug handling precautions for cytotoxic agents should be followed. Avoid contact or inhalation. 
In case of skin contact, the affected area should be washed immediately and thoroughly with soap 
and water. In case of eye contact, rinse thoroughly with water. Seek medical advice as soon as 
possible.

11  STATISTICAL PROCEDURES 

Complete details of the statistical analyses and methods, including data conventions, will be 
provided in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the first 
patient is randomized to the study. 

11.1  ANALYSIS VARIABLES  

11.1.1 General remark on efficacy data 
• 

Independent review 

The IRC (Independent Review Committee) will review the tumor assessments provided by 
investigators independently in a blinded fashion. The IRC will provide final assessment for 
responses (CR and PR), best response, date of first response, assessment of tumor progression, 
and the date of progression for each patient. The operational details of the review process will be 
provided in the IRC Charter. 

The details of measurability of tumor lesions, tumor measurements, definitions / confirmation of 
tumor response and determination of overall response by RECIST are provided in Appendix 3 and 
will be summarized in the SAP. 
•  Cut-off dates of the study 

There will be two cut-off dates for the study: 

Cut-off date for the evaluation of PFS(see the definition in Section 11.1.2): The cut-off date for 
the PFS evaluation will be the date when the required 617 events for PFS analysis have been 
observed. No tumor assessments occurring after this cut-off date will be reviewed by the IRC. At 
the time of the  PFS evaluation, analyses will also be performed for the safety and all other 
efficacy data relative to this cut-off date. It is anticipated that all efficacy data assessments except 
for OS are available and therefore will also be considered final at this time. 

Cut-off date for the evaluation of OS (see the definition Section 11.1.3): The cut-off date for the 
OS evaluation will be the date when the required 618 deaths have been observed. At the time of 
OS evaluation, the safety data relative to this cut-off date will be analyzed.

The primary efficacy variable is Progression Free Survival (PFS) defined as the time from 
randomization to first documentation of RECIST-defined objective tumor progression or death 
due to any cause. 

Tumor progressions and the date of the progressions will be determined by the IRC. 

For the analysis purpose, whether a patient reaches the endpoint of PFS (died or reached the 
RECIST-defined objective tumor progression) or is censored with respect to PFS will be 
determined by the following algorithm: 
•  For those patients who did not die nor reached the RECIST-defined objective tumor 

progression before the cut-off date: These patients are censored and the censoring date will be 
determined by the following scenarios: 
− 

If the patient took any other anti-tumor therapy, then the censoring date is the date of the 
last valid tumor assessment before the patient took the anti-tumor therapy or the date of 
cut-off, whichever comes first; 
If the patient did not take any other anti-tumor therapy then the censoring date is the date 
of the last valid tumor assessment or the date of cut-off, whichever comes first.

•  For those patients who died or reached the RECIST-defined objective tumor progression 

21-Sep-2006 
Final 

before the cut-off date: 
− 

If a patient took any other anti-tumor therapy before she/he died or reached the RECIST-
defined objective tumor progression, then the patient is censored and the censoring date is 
the date of the last valid tumor assessment before the patient took the anti-tumor therapy; 
If a patient did not take any other anti-tumor therapy and died or progressed without 
confirmed tumor progression ≥12 weeks (≥84 days) after the date of the last valid tumor 
assessment, then the patient is censored on the date of the last valid tumor assessment; 

− 

−  The patient reaches the endpoint in any other cases. 

The definition of further anti-tumor therapies will be provided in the SAP. 

Best effort should be made to maintain the censored subjects due to inadequate follow-up as few 
as possible. Details of the censoring calculation and statistical methodology of censoring handling 
will be provided in the SAP. 

11.1.3 Secondary efficacy variables 

The secondary efficacy variables include: 
•  Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death. 

The OS will be censored either at the last day that the survival status was available or the 
official cut-off day, whichever comes earlier. 

However, best effort should be made to obtain the survival status of every subject even for 
those who withdrew their consent for treatment. 

•  Single Time Progression Rate (STPR) defined as the proportion of patients with objective 

disease progression defined by RECIST by Day 120 of treatment, or death, relative to the total 
number of patients in the analysis population. 

In the definition, tumor progression and the date of the progressions are determined by the 
IRC. 

Each subject in the ITT population can have 3 possible outcomes in terms of STPR: Event, No 
event and Non-evaluable: 
−  Event: the subject had a tumor progression or death prior to and including Day 130 

assessment (Day 120 with an interval of 10 days). (Details will be provided in SAP). 

−  No event: the subject has had valid tumor assessments with no tumor progression or death 
before and including Day 130 assessment interval (Day 120 with an interval of 10 days). 

−  Non-evaluable: Any other cases. 

The details of measurability of tumor lesions, tumor measurements, and definitions of tumor 
response are provided in Appendix 3.

Page 91 

Amended Clinical Study Protocol 4 
EFC6089 [XRP9881B/3001] - Larotaxel 
•  Response Rate (RR) defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response 
(CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), defined by RECIST, relative to the total number of 
patients in the analysis population. 

21-Sep-2006 
Final 

In the definition, both CR and PR and corresponding dates are determined by the IRC. 

11.1.4  Other efficacy variables 

The other efficacy variables include: 
•  Time to Tumor Response (TTR) defined as the time from randomization to the first 

documentation of objective tumor response defined by RECIST. 

In the definition, both CR and PR and corresponding dates are determined by the IRC. 

TTR is calculated and summarized only for those subjects who achieved a best overall 
response of CR or PR. 

•  Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) defined as the time from randomization to the first 

documentation of objective tumor progression defined by RECIST, or final discontinuation of 
all study treatment, or death, whichever comes first. 

In the definition, tumor progression and the date of the progressions are determined by the 
IRC. 

Censoring determination will follow the same principle as that for the primary efficacy 
variable. The details will be provided in the SAP. 

•  Duration of Response (DR) defined as the time from the first documentation of objective 

tumor response by defined RECIST to the first documentation of objective tumor progression 
defined RECIST or death. 

In the definition, both CR and PR and corresponding dates are determined by the IRC. 

Censoring determination will follow the same principle as that for the primary efficacy 
variable. The details will be provided in the SAP. 

DR is calculated and summarized only for those subjects who achieved a best overall response 
of CR or PR. 

11.1.5 Safety variables 

The safety variables include: 
•  AE 

−  On-treatment period: On-treatment period is the period from the first dose to 30 days after 

the last dose.

11.2  ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 

Three analysis populations will be defined for this study: 
•  The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized patients. The treatment 

code of the each patient in the ITT population is determined by the treatment code originally 
assigned by randomization. 

This population is the primary efficacy analysis population and will be used in the analyses of 
all primary and secondary efficacy variables. 

•  The As-Treated (AT) population will consist of all patients who receive at least 1 partial dose 
of study drug. The treatment code of each patient in the as-treated population is determined by 
the treatment the subject actually received. 

This population will be evaluated for safety as well as for demographic and background 
information. 

•  The Evaluable Patient (EP) population will consist of all randomized patients who have 

measurable disease of breast cancer based on RECIST criteria, have baseline and at least one 
post-baseline valid tumor assessment (including symptomatic deterioration defined by 
RECIST), and also satisfy one of the following two conditions: 
−  Received at least 2 cycles of treatment at the intended dose 
−  Received less than 2 cycles of treatment at the intended dose but has evidence of disease 

progression or has withdrawn from study treatment due to unacceptable study drug-related 
toxicity. 

The treatment code of each subject in the Evaluable population is determined by the treatment 
the subject actually received. 

This population is the secondary efficacy analysis population and will be used in the analyses 
of the primary and selected secondary efficacy variables. 

11.3  STATISTICAL METHODS 

11.3.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics data 

Demographic and other characteristics data at baseline that has potential influence on the primary 
outcome of the study will be examined by treatment group and compared using appropriate 
descriptive techniques. 

Baseline variables of potential importance can include, for example, randomization stratification 
factors, age, baseline performance status, Her-2 receptor status, and estrogen receptor status/ 
progesterone receptor status. 

Summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics data will be provided for the ITT 
population. Summaries based on the “as treated” population will also be presented only if a major 
discrepancy with the ITT population is observed.

Final 

11.3.2 Extent of exposure 

The extent of exposure will be assessed based on the following measurements: 
•  Number of cycles of study therapy. 
•  Cumulative dose. 
•  Dose intensity (mg/m2/week). 
•  Relative dose intensity (actual/planned). 

Further details of the statistical evaluation of the extent of exposure data will be provided in the 
SAP. 

11.3.3 Efficacy data 

For all efficacy variables, the following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested: 

H0:  No treatment difference, 

H1: 

RPR109881 is better than capecitabine. 

All efficacy variables will be analyzed at an overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05. 

11.3.3.1 Primary efficacy variable (PFS) 

The primary analysis of PFS will be the comparison between the two treatment groups using a log 
rank test stratified by the randomization factors “treatment setting of prior taxanes administration” 
and “prior taxane responsiveness” as specified at the time of randomization. 

The rates of PFS event will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 

As a supportive analysis, the PFS will be also compared between the two treatment groups using a 
log rank test stratified by all 3 randomization factors. 

All analyses will be performed on the ITT population and, as a secondary analysis, on the EP 
population. 

11.3.3.2 Secondary efficacy variables 
•  Overall survival (OS): Time-to-death will be compared between the two treatments by the log-

rank test procedure stratified by the randomization factors. 

The survival curves will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. 

Both analyses will be performed on the ITT population.

Final 

An interim analysis of OS is planned at the time when the targeted number events (PFS) are 
observed for the primary efficacy analysis. The nominal alpha values used for the interim 
analysis and final analysis will be determined by a Gamma(-7) function. Details are provided 
in the interim analysis section below. 

•  Single time progression rate (STPR): Comparison of single-time (Day120) progression rates 
between treatment groups will be performed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified 
by the randomization factors. This analysis will be performed in the ITT population. 

A secondary analysis will also be performed using the Evaluable population. 

The primary approach for handling a “Non-evaluable” outcome of STPR is to treat it as “no 
event”. The analyses based on the Evaluable population will support the robustness of the 
evaluation. The details will be in the SAP. 

•  Overall response rate (RR): Comparison of overall response rates between treatment groups 

will be performed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by the randomization 
factors. This analysis will be performed in the ITT population. 

A secondary analysis will also be performed using the Evaluable population 

If a non-evaluable outcome of RR is observed, it will be treated as “non-response” in the 
analyses. The analyses based on evaluable population will support the robustness of the 
evaluation. The details will be in the SAP. 

11.3.3.3 Other efficacy variables 
•  Time to tumor response (TTR): TTR will be summarized among responders in the ITT 

population by treatment group. 

•  Time to treatment failure (TTF): TTF will be analyzed in the ITT population using Kaplan-

Meier estimates. The overall curves of the two treatment groups will be compared by the log-
rank test procedure, stratified by the randomization factors. 

•  Duration of response (DR): DR will be summarized among responders in the ITT population 

by treatment group. The Kaplan-Meier curve will be provided by treatment group. 

11.3.3.4 Additional analyses 

In addition to the efficacy analyses described above, exploratory analyses will be performed to 
confirm the consistency of the results. The details will be provided in the SAP. These analyses 
will include: 
•  Consistency of the treatment effect: The consistency of the treatment effect will be evaluated 
for the PFS and OS with respect to the 3 stratification factors and other selected demographic / 
prognostic factors such as age (≤50 and > 50), performance status, Her-2 receptor status (+++ 
versus other), and estrogen receptor status/ progesterone receptor status using a Cox 
proportional model in the ITT population. The interaction of the treatment and the 
demographic / prognostic factors will be evaluated for the consistency of the treatment effect.

Summary statistics and corresponding 90% confidence intervals will be provided for each of 
the parameters specified above. 
If necessary, similar analyses will be performed for other selected efficacy variables using 
appropriate statistical models. 

•  Baseline factor adjustment: The PFS and OS endpoints will be analyzed using a Cox 

proportional hazards model including treatment and selected prognostic factors such as age, 
performance status, Her-2 receptor status, and estrogen receptor status/ progesterone receptor 
status stratified by 3 stratification factors. 

•  More analyses are defined in the SAP 

11.3.4 Safety data 

The safety analyses will follow Aventis “Guideline for the Analysis and Reporting of Safety Data 
from Clinical Trials” (Document Number: GCLIN-BIO-GU-02-01). The details will be provided 
in the SAP. The safety summaries and analyses will be performed in the as-treated (AT) 
population. 

11.3.4.1 TEAE 

The primary and comprehensive analysis of safety will be based on the “treatment-emergent” 
principle. This analysis will comprise the basis upon which conclusions will be drawn regarding 
the safety profile. 

TEAEs will be summarized with respect to the incidence, severity (as graded by the NCI CTCAE, 
version 3.0), possible related or not, chronicity, and cumulative nature. Frequency tables sorted by 
system organ class and sorted by frequency will be provided by treatment. A p-value using a 
Fisher’s Exact test between the treatment groups may be provided as a flag for review purpose for 
any coded term that occurs in 10% or more of patients in either treatment arm. 

Details will be provided in the SAP. 

11.3.4.2 Serious AE 

Serious AEs will be summarized by system organ class. Details will be provided in the SAP. 

11.3.4.3 Special safety parameters 

The special safety parameters defined in Section 11.1.5 will be evaluated by treatment group. 
Frequency tables with 95% confidence intervals will be provided. Details will be provided in the 
SAP.

11.3.4.4 Discontinuation 
•  The frequencies of treatment discontinuations will be summarized by reason and treatment 

group. 

•  The frequencies of the treatment discontinuations due to AEs will be summarized by NCI-

CTC grade and treatment group. 

11.3.4.5 Major laboratory parameters 

For the lab parameters defined in Section 11.1.5, the following analyses will be performed: 
•  Summary statistics (n and %) based on the worst NCI grade during the treatment period; 
•  A shift table for each of the parameters to assess the changes in the NCI grades from baseline 

to the worst grade during the treatment period. 

11.3.5 Quality of life (QoL) data 

For the QoL (Global health status/QoL score of the QLQ-C30, and the Breast/arm symptom 
scores of QLQ-BR23), a longitudinal analysis using a mixed model with change from baseline as 
the response will be performed to account for all the available assessments during the study, 
including follow-up visits. The longitudinal model will be constructed with treatment groups and 
covariates prospectively specified in the statistical analysis plan. All analyses will be conducted 
on the ITT population unless otherwise stated. Missing data will be addressed via an appropriate 
method, such as a pattern mixture model or a logistic regression model. For clinical benefit data, 
change from baseline on weight and performance status will also be assessed using a longitudinal 
analysis. 

More details will be provided in the SAP. 

11.3.6 Health economic data 
•  The utility provided by EQ5D will be used for health economics evaluation. The summary 

will be performed based on “EuroQoL EQ-5D User Guide” and EQ-5D Scoring Note” that is 
provided in the SAP. 

•  The “resource utilization” measurement will be summarized. 

11.4  FUTILITY ANALYSIS 

Table 21 provides an outline of the futility analysis plan. 

Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 

An IDMC will be selected to monitor the safety data and to perform the futility analysis as 
described below. These analyses will be performed in an unblinded fashion.

Final 

11.4.1 Futility analysis 

11.4.1.1 Timing and objective 

A futility analysis will be performed when the first 200 patients have had a minimum of two 
tumor assessments, died or progressed. The objective of this futility analysis is for consideration 
of early termination if lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety data are observed. Due to the nature 
of this futility analysis, no stopping boundary is to be specified. The futility data will be provided 
to the IDMC by the Sanofi-Aventis Biometrics department and Clinical Data Management 
department in a blinded fashion and the treatment code will be provided separately from the IVRS 
system. The IDMC will assess the unblinded futility data and provides its recommendation only to 
Sanofi-Aventis management. The operational details of the futility analysis will be provided in 
IDMC Charter. 

11.4.1.2 Efficacy evaluation 

The overall response rate (RR) will be evaluated based on a conditional power. The conditional 
power will be calculated by combining the rate observed at the time of the interim analysis and 
the assumed true response rates of 30% for RPR109881 and 20% for capecitabine. These assumed 
response rates are based on the observed rates in Study 204 for RPR109881 and available 
publications for capecitabine and give an 89% power at a 2-sided 5% alpha level with 400 
subjects per arm. Termination of the trial will be considered if the conditional power is lower than 
30%. This 30% level of conditional power was selected based on a worst-case scenario where a 
RR for RPR109881 is 10% and RR for capecitabine is 20% at the interim of 25% information 
time. 

11.4.2 Interim evaluation of OS 

11.4.2.1 Timing and objective 

An interim analysis for OS will be performed by Aventis BDM at the time of the final analysis 
forPFS. The nature of this interim analysis is supportive. The other efficacy variables will also be 
evaluated at this time. The analyses for the other efficacy variables are considered as final. 

11.4.2.2 Stopping boundary 

Using a group sequential approach, a Gamma (-7) spending function will be used to determine the 
stopping boundary for the OS evaluation to reject the null hypothesis early. The reference for a 
Gamma type of spending function and a general theory of the “group sequential method” can be 
seen in [29,30].

11.4.2.3 OS evaluation 

OS will be evaluated by a comparison of the time-to-death, as defined in Section 11.1.3, using a 
log-rank test stratified by the randomization factors “treatment setting of prior taxanes 
administration” and “prior taxane responsiveness” as specified at the time of randomization. The 
significance level used will be calculated using the “group sequential” approach with a Gamma(-
7) spending function described above based on the proportion of the observed number of deaths at 
the interim time to the total planned number of deaths at the end of the study, 

The death rates will be estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. 

11.4.2.4 Safety evaluation 

Safety data including AE, SAE, vital sign, and major lab findings will also be evaluated at the 
time of the final PFS analysis. 

11.4.3 Periodic safety review 

The IDMC will perform data reviews periodically to monitor any potential safety issues. In order 
for the IDMC to make a meaningful assessment of the drug effect on safety, tumor assessment 
data will also be provided per IDMC’s request starting from the futility analysis and all safety 
reviews thereafter. Although the IDMC will have access to the unblinded efficacy data, the IDMC 
does not have intention to stop the trial at any interim look for any positive findings in drug 
efficacy. However, to protect the integrity of the study, a group sequential stopping boundary 
using a Gamma (-12) function is selected for the PFS endpoint to control the overall alpha level. 
From the date of the protocol amendment, it is predicted that there will be about 3 interim looks 
including the futility analysis before the final PFS analysis. The timing and other details will be 
provided in the IDMC Charter. 

11.5  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION 

The sample size was calculated based on the following statistical hypotheses: 

H0:  Hazard Ratio = 1 (No treatment difference) 

H1: 

Hazard Ratio < 1 (RPR109881 is better than capecitabine). 

Approximately 800 patients, 400 patients randomized to the RPR109881 treatment arm and 400 
patients to the capecitabine treatment arm,

The analysis of overall survival (OS) will be conducted when at least 618 deaths are observed, 
with a single interim analysis using an boundary determined by “group sequential” approach with 
a Gamma (-7) spending function to reject the null hypothesis, to be conducted at the time of the 
PFS assessment. This analysis will have 90% overall statistical power (two-sided alpha level of 
0.05) to detect an OS hazard ratio of 0.77, assuming a median survival of capecitabine-treated 
patients of 15.2 months, corresponding to an improvement of approximate 30% in median 
survival. 

The sample size calculation was performed using EAST 3 (Version 3.0.0, April 24th, 2003, Cytel 
Software Corporation).

scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form 
understandable to them. 

An informed consent document that includes both information about the study and the consent 
form will be prepared and given to the patient. This document will contain all the elements 
required by the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and any additional elements required 
by local regulations. The document must be in a language understandable to the patient and must 
specify who informed the patient. Where required by local law, the person who informs the 
patient must be a physician. 

After reading the informed consent document, the patient must give consent in writing. The 
patient's consent must be confirmed at the time of consent by the personally dated signature of the 
patient and by the personally dated signature of the person conducting the informed consent 
discussions. 

If the patient is unable to read, oral presentation and explanation of the written informed consent 
form and information to be supplied to patients must take place in the presence of an impartial 
witness. Consent must be confirmed at the time of consent orally and by the personally dated 
signature of the patient or by a local legally recognized alternative (eg, the patient's thumbprint or

mark). The witness and the person conducting the informed consent discussions must also sign 
and personally date the consent document. 

A copy of the signed consent document must be given to the patient. The original signed consent 
document will be retained by the investigator. 

If a patient is not in a position to give informed consent because of his or her physical or mental 
condition, the consent of a legally authorized representative* must be sought. The consent must 
be confirmed at the time of consent by the personally dated signature of the representative and by 
the personally dated signature of the person conducting the informed consent discussions. A copy 
of the signed consent document must be given to the representative. The original signed consent 
document will be retained by the investigator. Local legal requirements must be observed and 
informed consent must be sought from the patient as soon as possible afterwards, if feasible. This 
procedure must have prior agreement from the independent ethics committee (IEC)/institutional 
review board (IRB). 

* “Legally authorized representative” means an individual or judicial or other body authorized 
under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research. 

The investigator will not undertake any measures specifically required only for the clinical study 
until valid consent has been obtained. 

The investigator should inform the patient’s primary physician about the patient’s participation in 
the trial if the patient has a primary physician and if the patient agrees to the primary physician 
being informed. 

12.4  CONFIDENTIALITY 

Patient names will not be supplied to the sponsor. Only the patient number and patient initials will 
be recorded in the CRF, and if the patient name appears on any other document (eg, laboratory 
report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the sponsor. Study 
findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws. The 
patients will be informed that representatives of the sponsor, independent ethics committee (IEC)/ 
institutional review board (IRB), or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to 
verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection 
will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws. 

The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with the 
corresponding patient names) to enable records to be identified. 

12.5  PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 

Neither the investigator nor the sponsor will alter this clinical study protocol without obtaining the 
written agreement of the other. Once the study has started, amendments should be made only in 
exceptional cases. The changes then become part of the clinical study protocol.

12.6  APPROVAL OF THE CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AND AMENDMENTS 
Before the start of the study, the clinical study protocol, informed consent document, and any 
other appropriate documents will be submitted to the IEC/IRB with a cover letter or a form 
listing the documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of 
jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also 
be submitted to the authorities, in accordance with local legal requirements. 
Investigational products can only be supplied to the investigator after documentation on all ethical 
and legal requirements for starting the study has been received by the sponsor. This 
documentation must also include a list of the members of the IEC/IRB and their occupation and 
qualifications. If the IEC/IRB will not disclose the names of the committee members, it should be 
asked to issue a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with 
GCP. Formal approval by the IEC/IRB should preferably mention the study title, study code, 
study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), amendment number where applicable, 
and any other documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and 
must be officially signed by a committee member. 
Before the first patient is enrolled in the study, all ethical and legal requirements must be met. 
The IEC/IRB and, if applicable, the authorities must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments and administrative changes, in accordance with local legal requirements. 
Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether formal approval must be sought and 
whether the informed consent document should also be revised. 
The investigator must keep a record of all communication with the IEC/IRB and, if applicable, 
between a coordinating investigator and the IEC/IRB. This also applies to any communication 
between the investigator (or coordinating investigator, if applicable) and the authorities. 

12.7  ONGOING INFORMATION FOR INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE/ 

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD 

Unless otherwise instructed by the IEC/IRB, the investigator must submit to the IEC/IRB: 
• 

Information on serious or unexpected adverse events from the investigator’s site, as soon as 
possible 

•  Expedited safety reports from the sponsor, as soon as possible 
•  Periodic reports on the progress of the study 

12.8  CLOSURE OF THE STUDY 
The study must be closed at the site on completion. Furthermore, the sponsor or the investigator 
has the right to close this study site at any time. As far as possible, premature closure should occur 
after mutual consultation. Depending on local legislation, it may be necessary to inform IEC/IRB 
and the regulatory authorities when the study site is closed. 
Study materials must be returned, disposed of, or retained as directed by the sponsor.

12.9  RECORD RETENTION 

The investigator must obtain approval in writing from the sponsor before destruction of any 
records. 

Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the investigational product. However, because of international regulatory 
requirements, the sponsor may request retention for a longer period. 

Essential documents include: 
•  Signed informed consent documents for all patients 
•  Patient identification code list*, screening log (if applicable) and enrollment log 
•  Record of all communications between the investigator and the IEC/IRB 
•  Composition of the IEC/IRB (or other applicable statement as described in Section 12.6) 
•  Record of all communications between the investigator and sponsor (or CRO) 
•  List of subinvestigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigator has 

delegated significant trial-related duties, together with their roles in the study and their 
signatures 

Investigational product accountability records 

•  Copies of CRFs and of documentation of corrections for all patients 
• 
•  Record of any body fluids or tissue samples retained 
•  All other source documents (patient medical records, hospital records, laboratory records, etc.) 
•  All other documents as listed in section 8 of the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 

(Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial) 

Normally, these records will be held in the investigator's archives. If the investigator is unable to 
meet this obligation, he or she must ask the sponsor for permission to make alternative 
arrangements. Details of these arrangements should be documented. 

*EU legislation requires this list to be maintained for a minimum of 15 years

13  STUDY MONITORING AND AUDITING 

Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or endorsed by the sponsor will be followed, in 
order to comply with GCP guidelines. Direct access to the on-site study documentation and 
medical records must be ensured. 

13.1  STUDY MONITORING AND SOURCE DATA VERIFICATION 

Monitoring will be done by personal visits from a representative of the sponsor (study monitor) 
who will check the CRFs for completeness and clarity, and crosscheck them with source 
documents. In addition to the monitoring visits, frequent communications (letter, telephone, and 
fax), by the study monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol 
design and regulatory requirements. 

Study close-out will be performed by the study monitor upon closure of the study. 

13.2  ON-SITE AUDITS 

Domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, the IEC/IRB, and an auditor authorized by the 
sponsor may request access to all source documents, CRFs, and other study documentation for on-
site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by the investigator, 
who must provide support at all times for these activities. Medical records and other study 
documents may be copied during audit or inspection provided that patient names are obliterated 
on the copies to ensure confidentiality.

14  DOCUMENTATION AND USE OF STUDY FINDINGS 

14.1  DOCUMENTATION OF STUDY FINDINGS 

A CRF will be provided for each patient. 

All protocol-required information collected during the study must be entered by the investigator, 
or designated representative, in the CRF. Details of CRF completion and correction will be 
explained to the investigator. If the investigator authorizes other persons to make entries in the 
CRF, the names, positions, signatures, and initials of these persons must be supplied to the 
sponsor. 

The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the CRF pages as soon as possible 
after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an 
examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be completed 
immediately after the final examination. An explanation should be given for all missing data. 

A source data location list will be prepared prior to study start. This list will be filed in both the 
trial master file and the investigator study file and updated as necessary. 

The completed CRF must be reviewed and signed by the investigator named in the clinical study 
protocol or by a designated subinvestigator. 

The sponsor will retain the originals of all CRFs. The investigator will retain a copy of all 
completed case report form CRF pages. 

14.2  USE OF STUDY FINDINGS 

All information concerning the product as well as any matter concerning the operation of the 
sponsor, such as clinical indications for the drug, its formula, methods of manufacture and other 
scientific data relating to it, that have been provided by the sponsor and are unpublished, are 
confidential and must remain the sole property of the sponsor. The investigator will agree to use 
the information only for the purposes of carrying out this study and for no other purpose unless 
prior written permission from the sponsor is obtained. 

The sponsor has full ownership of the original CRFs completed as part of the study. 

By signing the clinical study protocol, the investigator agrees that the results of the study may be 
used for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for 
medical and pharmaceutical professionals. The authorities will be notified of the investigator's 
name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement. 

The sponsor will ensure that a final report on the study is prepared.

The investigator (or coordinating investigator) will be required to sign a statement that he or she 
confirms that, to the best of his or her knowledge, it accurately describes the conduct and results 
of the study. 

All materials, documents and information supplied by the sponsor to the investigator, and all 
materials, documents and information prepared or developed in the course of the study to be 
performed under this protocol, shall be the sole and exclusive property of the sponsor. Subject to 
obligations of confidentiality, the investigator reserves the right to publish only the results of the 
work performed pursuant to this protocol, provided, however, that the investigator provides an 
authorized representative of the sponsor with a copy of any proposed publication for review and 
comment at least 45 days in advance of its submission for publication. In addition, if requested, 
the investigator will withhold publication an additional 90 days to allow for filing a patent 
application or taking such other measures as the sponsor deems appropriate to establish and 
preserve its proprietary rights. 

It is agreed that, consistent with scientific standards, publication of the results of the study shall be

*“Clinically apparent” is defined as detected by imaging studies (excluding lymphoscintigraphy) or by 
clinical examination. 
† Classification is based on axillary lymph node dissection with or without sentinel lymph node dissection. 
Classification based solely on sentinel lymph node dissection without subsequent axillary lymph node 
dissection is designated (sn) for “sentinel node” (eg, pN0(i+)(sn)). 
‡ Isolated tumor cells are defined as single tumor cells or small cell clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, 
usually detected only by immunohistochemical or molecular methods but which may be verified on 
hematoxylin and eosin stains. Isolated tumor cells do not usually show evidence of metastatic activity (eg, 
proliferation or stromal reaction). 
§ “Not clinically apparent” is defined as not detected by imaging studies (excluding lymphoscintigraphy) 
or by clinical examination. 
¶ If associated with more than three positive axillary lymph nodes, the internal mammary nodes are 
classified as pN3b to reflect increased tumor burden.

the  much 

toxic  5-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-fluorouracil 

is  extensively  metabolized  enzymatically 

uracil. Thymidylate is thenecessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential 
for the synthesis of DNA, so that a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. 
Second,  nuclear  transcriptional  enzymes  can  mistakenly  incorporate  FUTP  in  place  of 
uridine  triphosphate  (UTP)  during  the  synthesis  of  RNA.  This  metabolic  error  can 
interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis. 
Pharmacokinetics in Colorectal Tumors and Adjacent Healthy Tissue:  Following oral 
administration of capecitabine 7 days before surgery in patients with colorectal cancer, the 
median ratio of 5-FU concentration in colorectal tumors to adjacent tissues was 2.9 (range 
from  0.9  to  8.0).  These  ratios  have  not  been  evaluated  in  breast  cancer  patients  or 
compared to 5-FU infusion. 
Human Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of XELODA and its metabolites have 
been  evaluated  in  about  200  cancer  patients  over  a  dosage  range  of  500  to  3500 
mg/m2/day. Over this range, the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolite, 5’-
DFCR were dose proportional and did not change over time. The increases in the AUCs of 
5’-DFUR and 5-FU, however, were greater than proportional to the increase in dose and 
the AUC of 5-FU was 34% higher on day 14 than on day 1. The elimination half-life of 
both parent capecitabine and 5-FU was about ¾ of an hour. The inter-patient variability in 
the Cmax and AUC of 5-FU was greater than 85%. 
Absorption,  Distribution,  Metabolism  and  Excretion:  Capecitabine  reached  peak  blood 
levels in about 1.5 hours (Tmax) with peak 5-FU levels occurring slightly later, at 2 hours. 
Food reduced both the rate and extent of absorption of capecitabine with mean Cmax and 
AUC0-∞decreased by 60% and 35%, respectively. The Cmax and AUC0-∞ of 5-FU were also 
reduced by food by 43% and 21%, respectively. Food delayed Tmax of both parent and 5-
FU by 1.5 hours (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
Plasma  protein  binding  of  capecitabine  and  its  metabolites  is  less  than  60%  and  is  not 
concentration-dependent.  Capecitabine  was  primarily  bound 
to  human  albumin 
(approximately 35%). 
Capecitabine 
to  5-FU.  The  enzyme 
dihydropyrimidine  dehydrogenase  hydrogenates  5-FU,  the  product  of  capecitabine 
metabolism, 
(FUH2). 
Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield 5-fluoro-ureido-propionic acid 
(FUPA). Finally, β-ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to α-fluoro-β-alanine (FBAL) which 
is cleared in the urine. 
Capecitabine  and  its  metabolites  are  predominantly  excreted  in  urine;  95.5%  of 
administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Fecal excretion is minimal (2.6%). 
The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL which represents 57% of the administered 
dose. About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. 
Special Populations: 
Age, Gender and Ethnicity: No formal studies were conducted to examine the effect of age 
or gender or ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites. 
Hepatic Insufficiency: XELODA has been evaluated in 13 patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic  dysfunction  due  to  liver  metastases  defined  by  a  composite  score  including 
bilirubin,  AST/ALT  and  alkaline  phosphatase  following  a  single  1255  mg/m2  dose  of 
capecitabine.  Both  AUC0-∞  and  Cmax  of  capecitabine  increased  by  60%  in  patients  with 
hepatic dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n=14). The AUC0-
∞ and Cmax of 5-FU was not affected. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction 
due to liver metastases, caution should be exercised when XELODA is administered. The 
effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on XELODA is not known (see PRECAUTIONS and 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
Renal  Insufficiency:  No  formal  pharmacokinetic  study  was  conducted  in  patients  with 
renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS). 
Drug-Drug Interactions: 
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: In vitro enzymatic studies with human 
liver  microsomes  indicated  that  capecitabine  and  5'-DFUR  had  no  inhibitory  effects  on 
substrates of cytochrome P450  for the  major  isoenzymes  such as 1A2, 2A6, 3A4, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, and 2E1, suggesting a low likelihood of interactions with drugs metabolized 
by cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Antacid:  When  Maalox®*  (20  mL),  an  aluminum  hydroxide-  and  magnesium 
hydroxidecontaining  antacid,  was  administered  immediately  after  capecitabine  (1250 
mg/m2, n=12 cancer patients), AUC and Cmax increased by 16% and 35%, respectively, for 
capecitabine and by 18% and 22%, respectively, for 5'-DFCR. No effect was observed on 
the other three major metabolites (5’-DFUR, 5-FU, FBAL) of capecitabine. 
XELODA has a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions related to plasma protein 
binding. 
CLINICAL STUDIES: In a phase 1 study with XELODA in patients with solid tumors, 
the maximum tolerated dose as a single agent was 3000 mg/m2 when administered daily 
for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest period. The dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhea 
and leukopenia. 
Breast Carcinoma: The antitumor activity of XELODA was  evaluated  in an open-label 
singlearm trial conducted in 24 centers in the US and Canada. A total of 162 patients with 
stage IV breast cancer were enrolled. The primary endpoint was tumor response rate in 
patients with measurable disease, with response defined as a ≥50% decrease in sum of the 
products of the perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable disease for at least 
1 month. XELODA was administered at a daily dose of 2510 mg/m2 for 2 weeks followed 
by  a  1-week  rest  period  and  given  as  3-week  cycles.  The  baseline  demographics  and 
clinical characteristics for all patients (n=162) and those with measurable disease (n=135) 
are  shown  in  the  table  below.  Resistance  was  defined  as  progressive  disease  while  on 
treatment, with or without an initial response, or relapse within 6 months of completing 
treatment with an anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimen.

DESCRIPTION:  XELODA  (capecitabine) 
is  a  fluoropyrimidine  carbamate  with 
antineoplastic  activity.  It  is  an  orally  administered  systemic  prodrug  of  5’-deoxy-5-
fluorouridine (5’-DFUR) which is converted to 5-fluorouracil. 
The  chemical  name  for  capecitabine  is  5’-deoxy-5-fluoro-N-[(pentyloxy)carbonyl]-
cytidine and has a molecular weight of 359.35. Capecitabine has the following structural 
formula: 

 

 

lactose, 

sodium, 

croscarmellose 

Capcitabine  is a  white to off-white crystalline powder with an aqueous solubility of 26 
mg/mL at 20ºC. 
XELODA  is  supplied  as  biconvex,  oblong  film-coated  tablets  for  oral  administration. 
Each  light  peach-colored  tablet  contains  150  mg  capecitabine  and  each  peach-colored 
tablet  contains  500  mg  capecitabine.  The  inactive  ingredients  in  XELODA  include: 
anhydrous 
hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose, 
microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium 
stearate and purified water. The peach or light peach film coating contains hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose, talc, titanium dioxide, and synthetic yellow and red iron oxides. 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Capecitabine is relatively non-cytotoxic in vitro. This 
drug is enzymatically converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in vivo. 
Bioactivation: Capecitabine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In the liver, 
a 60 kDa carboxyesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5’-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine 
(5’-DFCR).  Cytidine  deaminase,  an  enzyme  found  in  most  tissues,  including  tumors, 
subsequently  converts  5’-DFCR  to  5’-deoxy-5-fluorouridine  (5’-DFUR).  The  enzyme, 
thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), then hydrolyzes 5’-DFUR to the active drug 5-FU. 
Many  tissues  throughout  the  body  express  thymidine  phosphorylase.  Some  human 
carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentrations than surrounding normal tissues.

XELODA® (capecitabine) 

 
Mechanism  of  Action:  Both  normal  and  tumor  cells  metabolize  5-FU  to  5-fluoro-2-
deoxyuridine  monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). These 
metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate 
cofactor, N5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a 
covalently bound ternarycomplex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from

2From date of first response 
For the subgroup of 43 patients who were doubly resistant, the median time to progression 
was 102 days and the median survival was 255 days. The objective response rate in this 
population  was  supported  by  a  response  rate  of  18.5%  (1  CR,  24  PRs)  in  the  overall 
population  of  135  patients  with  measurable  disease,  who  were  less  resistant  to 
chemotherapy (see Table 1). The median time to progression was 90 days and the median 
survival was 306 days. 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE: XELODA is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic  breast  cancer  resistant  to  both  paclitaxel  and  an  anthracycline-containing 
chemotherapy  regimen  or  resistant  to  paclitaxel  and  for  whom  further  anthracycline 
therapy is not indicated, eg, patients who have received cumulative doses of 400 mg/m2 of 
doxorubicin or doxorubicin equivalents. Resistance is defined as progressive disease while 
on treatment, with or without an initial response, or relapse within 6 months of completing 
treatment with an anthracycline-containing adjuvant regimen. 
This indication is based on demonstration of a response rate. No results are available from 
controlled  trials  that  demonstrate  a  clinical  benefit  resulting  from  treatment,  such  as 
improvement in disease-related symptoms, disease progression, or survival. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS:  XELODA  is contraindicated  in patients who have a known 
hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil. 
WARNINGS: Coagulopathy: Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been 
reported 
taking  XELODA  concomitantly  with  coumarin-derivative 
anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon. These events occurred within several 
days  and  up  to  several  months  after  initiating  XELODA  therapy  and,  in  a  few  cases, 
within one  month after  stopping XELODA. These events occurred  in patients with  and 
without liver metastases. Patients taking coumarinderivative anticoagulants concomitantly 
with  XELODA  should  be  monitored  regularly  for  alterations  in  their  coagulation 
parameters (PT or INR) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Drug Interactions). 
Diarrhea: XELODA can induce diarrhea, sometimes severe. Patients with severe diarrhea 
should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become 
dehydrated. The median time to first occurrence of grade 2-4 diarrhea was 31 days (range 
from  1  to  322  days).  National  Cancer  Institute  of  Canada  (NCIC)  grade  2  diarrhea  is 
defined  as  an  increase  of  4  to  6  stools/day  or  nocturnal  stools,  grade  3  diarrhea  as  an 
increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and malabsorption, and grade 4 diarrhea as an 
increase of ≥10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhea or the need for parenteral support. If 
grade  2,  3  or  4  diarrhea  occurs,  administration  of  XELODA  should  be  immediately 
interrupted until the diarrhea resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 
3 or 4 diarrhea, subsequent doses of XELODA should be decreased (see DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION).  Standard 
are 
recommended. 
Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has been reported. 
Geriatric  Patients  (gastrointestinal  toxicity):  Patients  ≥80  years  old  may  experience  a 
greater  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  grade  3  or  4  adverse  events  (see  PRECAUTIONS: 
Geriatric  Use).  Among  the  14  patients  80  years  of  age  and  greater  treated  with 
capecitabine, three (21.4%), three (21.4%) and one (7.1%) patients experienced reversible 
grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, respectively. 
Among the 313 patients age 60 to 79 years old, the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity 
was similar to that in the overall population. 
Pregnancy:  XELODA  may  cause  fetal  harm  when  given  to  a  pregnant  woman. 
Capecitabine  at  doses  of  198  mg/kg/day  during  organogenesis  caused  teratogenic 
malformations and embryo death in mice. In separate pharmacokinetic studies, this dose in 
mice produced 5’-DFUR AUC values about 0.2 times the corresponding values in patients 
administered  the  recommended  daily  dose.  Teratogenic  malformations  in  mice  included 
cleft palate, anophthalmia,  microphthalmia, oligodactyly, polydactyly,  syndactyly, kinky 
tail and dilation of cerebral  ventricles. At doses of 90  mg/kg/day, capecitabine given to 
pregnant monkeys during organogenesis caused fetal death. This dose produced 5’-DFUR 
AUC  values  about  0.6  times  the  corresponding  values  in  patients  administered  the 
recommended daily dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women using XELODA. If the drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes 
pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to 
the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant 
while receiving treatment with XELODA.

PRECAUTIONS:  General:  Patients  receiving  therapy  with  XELODA  should  be 
monitored by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Most 
adverse events are reversible and do not need to result in discontinuation, although doses 
may need to be withheld or reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
Hand-and-Foot  Syndrome:  Hand-and-foot  syndrome  (palmar-plantar  erythrodysesthesia 
or  chemotherapy  induced  acral  erythema)  is  characterized  by  the  following:  numbness, 
dysesthesia/paresthesia,  tingling,  painless  or  painful  swelling,  erythema,  desquamation, 
blistering and severe pain. Grade 2 hand-and-foot syndrome is defined as painful erythema 
and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the patient’s activities of 
daily  living.  Grade  3  hand-and-foot  syndrome  is  defined  as  moist  desquamation, 
ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the hands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that 
causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living. If grade 2 or 3 
hand-and-foot syndrome occurs, administration of XELODA should  be  interrupted until 
the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 hand-and-foot 
syndrome,  subsequent  doses  of  XELODA  should  be  decreased  (see  DOSAGE  AND 
ADMINISTRATION). 
Cardiac:  There  has  been  cardiotoxicity  associated  with  fluorinated  pyrimidine  therapy, 
including  myocardial  infarction,  angina,  dysrhythmias,  cardiogenic  shock,  sudden  death 
and electrocardiograph changes. These adverse events may be more common in patients 
with a prior history of coronary artery disease. 
Hepatic  Insufficiency:  Patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  dysfunction  due  to  liver 
metastases should be carefully monitored when XELODA is administered. The effect of 
severe hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of XELODA is not known (see CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
Hyperbilirubinemia:  Grade  3  or  4  hyperbilirubinemia  occurred  in  17%  (n=97)  of  570 
patients  with  either  metastatic  breast  or  colorectal  cancer  who  received  a  dose  of  2510 
mg/m2  daily  for  2  weeks  followed  by  a  1-week  rest  period.  Of  339  patients  who  had 
hepatic  metastases  at  baseline  and  231  patients  without  hepatic  metastases  at  baseline, 
grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 21.2% and 10.4%, respectively. Seventy-four 
(76%)  of  the  97  patients  with  grade  3  or  4  hyperbilirubinemia  also  had  concurrent 
elevations in alkaline phosphatase and/or hepatic transaminases; 6% of these were grade 3 
or  4.  Only  4  patients  (4%)  had  elevated  hepatic  transaminases  without  a  concurrent 
elevation in alkaline phosphatase. If drug related grade 2-4 elevations in bilirubin occur, 
administration  of  XELODA 
the 
hyperbilirubinemia  resolves  or  decreases  in  intensity  to  grade  1.  NCIC  grade  2 
hyperbilirubinemia  is  defined  as  1.5  x  normal,  grade  3  hyperbilirubinemia  as  1.5-3  x 
normal  and  grade  4  hyperbilirubinemia  as  >3  x  normal.  (See  recommended  dose 
modifications under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) 
Renal Insufficiency: There is little experience inpatients with renal impairment. Physicians 
should  exercise  caution  when  XELODA 
is  administered  (see  DOSAGE  AND 
ADMINISTRATION). 
Hematologic:  In  570  patients  with  either  metastatic  breast  or  colorectal  cancer  who 
received a dose of 2510 mg/m2 administered daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest 
period, 4%, 2%, and 3% of patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
decreases in hemoglobin, respectively. 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals 
to  evaluate  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  capecitabine  have  not  been  conducted. 
Capecitabine  was  not  mutagenic  in  vitro  to  bacteria  (Ames  test)  or  mammalian  cells 
(Chinese hamster V79/HPRT gene mutation assay). Capecitabine was clastogenic in vitro 
to human peripheral blood lymphocytes but not clastogenic in vivo to mouse bone marrow 
(micronucleus test). Fluorouracil causes mutations in bacteria and yeast. Fluorouracil also 
causes chromosomal abnormalities in the mouse micronucleus test in vivo. 
Impairment  of  Fertility:  In  studies  of  fertility  and  general  reproductive  performance  in 
mice, oral capecitabine doses of 760 mg/kg/day disturbed estrus and consequently caused 
a decrease in fertility. In mice that became pregnant, no fetuses survived this dose. The 
disturbance in estrus was reversible. In males, this dose caused degenerative changes in 
the testes, including decreases in the number of spermatocytes and spermatids. In separate 
pharmacokinetic  studies,  this  dose  in  mice  produced  5’-DFUR  AUC  values  about  0.7 
times the corresponding values in patients administered the recommended daily dose. 
Information for Patients (see Patient Package Insert): Patients and patients’ caregivers 
should  be  informed  of  the  expected  adverse  effects  of  XELODA,  particularly  nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, and hand-and-foot syndrome, and should be made aware that patient-
specific dose adaptations during therapy are expected and necessary (see DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be encouraged to recognize the common grade 2 
toxicities associated with XELODA treatment. 
Diarrhea:  Patients  experiencing  grade  2  diarrhea  (an  increase  of  4  to  6  stools/day  or 
nocturnal  stools)  or  greater  should  be  instructed  to  stop  taking  XELODA  immediately. 
Standard antidiarrheal treatments (eg, loperamide) are recommended. 
Nausea: Patients experiencing grade 2 nausea (food intake significantly decreased but able 
to eat intermittently) or greater should be instructed to stop taking XELODA immediately. 
Initiation of symptomatic treatment is recommended. 
Vomiting: Patients experiencing grade 2 vomiting (2 to 5 episodes in a 24-hour period) or 
greater  should  be  instructed  to  stop  taking  XELODA  immediately.  Initiation  of 
symptomatic treatment is recommended. 
Hand-and-Foot  Syndrome:  Patients  experiencing  grade  2  hand-and-foot  syndrome 
(painful  erythema and swelling of the  hands  and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the 
patients’ activities of daily living) or greater should be instructed to stop taking XELODA 
immediately. 
Stomatitis: Patients experiencing grade 2 stomatitis (painful erythema, edema or ulcers of 
the  mouth  or  tongue,  but  able  to  eat)  or  greater  should  be  instructed  to  stop  taking 
XELODA  immediately.  Initiation  of  symptomatic  treatment  is  recommended  (see 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
Fever  and  Neutropenia:  Patients  who  develop  a  fever  of  100.5°F  or  greater  or  other 
evidence of potential infection should be instructed to call their physician. 
Drug-Food  Interaction:  In  all  clinical  trials,  patients  were  instructed  to  administer 
XELODA within 30 minutes after a meal. Since current safety and efficacy data are based 
upon  administration  with  food,  it  is  recommended  that  XELODA  be  administered  with 
food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
Drug-Drug Interactions: 
Antacid:  The  effect  of  an  aluminum  hydroxide-  and  magnesium  hydroxide-containing 
antacid (Maalox)* on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine was investigated in 12 cancer 
patients.  There  was  a  small  increase  in  plasma  concentrations  of  capecitabine  and  one

metabolite (5’-DFCR); there was no effect on the 3 major  metabolites (5’-DFUR, 5-FU 
and FBAL). 
Coumarin  Anticoagulants:  Altered  coagulation  parameters  and/or  bleeding  have  been 
reported 
taking  capecitabine  concomitantly  with  coumarin-derivative 
anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon. Patients taking coumarin-derivative 
anticoagulants  concomitantly  with  capecitabine  should  be  monitored  regularly  for 
alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR) (see WARNINGS: Coagulopathy). 
Phenytoin: Postmarketing reports indicate that some patients receiving capecitabine and 
phenytoin had toxicity associated with elevated phenytoin levels. The level of phenytoin 
should be carefully monitored in patients taking XELODA and phenytoin dose may need 
to be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dose Modification Guidelines). 
Leucovorin:  The  concentration  of  5-fluorouracil  is  increased  and  its  toxicity  may  be 
enhanced by leucovorin. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have 
been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly leucovorin and fluorouracil. 
Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Category D (see WARNINGS). Women of childbearing 
potential  should  be  advised  to  avoid  becoming  pregnant  while  receiving  treatment  with 
XELODA. 
Nursing Women: It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because 
many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions  in  nursing  infants,  it  is  recommended  that  nursing  be  discontinued  when 
receiving XELODA therapy. 
Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of XELODA in persons <18 years of age have 
not been established. 
Geriatric Use: No separate studies have been conducted to examine the effect of age on 
the  pharmacokinetics  of  capecitabine  and  its  metabolites.  Patients  ≥80  years  old  may 
experience  a  greater  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  grade  3  or  4  adverse  events  (see 
WARNINGS).  Among  the  14  patients  80  years  of  age  and  greater  treated  with 
capecitabine,  21.4%,  21.4%  and  7.1%  experienced  grade  3  or  4  diarrhea,  nausea  and 
vomiting,  respectively.  Among  the  313  patients  60  to  79  years  old,  the  incidence  was 
similar to the overall population. 
The  elderly  may  be  pharmacodynamically  more  sensitive  to  the  toxic  effects  of  5-FU. 
Physicians should pay particular attention to monitoring the adverse effects of XELODA 
in the elderly. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS: 
The following table shows the adverse events occurring in ≥5% of patients reported as at 
least remotely related to the administration of XELODA. Rates are rounded to the nearest 
whole number. The data are shown both for the study in stage IV breast cancer and for a 
group  of  570  patients  with  breast  and  colorectal  cancer  who  received  a  dose  of  2510 
mg/m2 administered daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period. The 570 patients 
were  enrolled  in  6  clinical  trials  (162  from  the  breast  cancer  trial  described  under 
CLINICAL  STUDIES,  83  other  patients  with  breast  cancer  and  325  patients  with 
colorectal cancer). The mean duration of treatment was 121 days. A total of 71 patients 
(13%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events/intercurrent illness.

OVERDOSAGE:  Acute:  Based  on  experience  in  animals  and  in  humans  treated  up  to 
doses  of  3514  mg/m2/day,  the  anticipated  manifestations  of  acute  overdose  would  be 
nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  gastrointestinal  irritation  and  bleeding,  and  bone  marrow 
depression.  Medical  management  of  overdose  should  include  customary  supportive 
medical interventions aimed at correcting the presenting clinical manifestations. Although 
no clinical experience has been reported, dialysis may be of benefit in reducing circulating 
concentrations of 5’-DFUR, a low-molecular weight metabolite of the parent compound. 
Single doses of XELODA were not lethal to mice, rats, and monkeys at doses up to 2000 
mg/kg (2.4, 4.8, and 9.6 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis). 
DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  The  recommended  dose  of  XELODA  is  2500 
mg/m2 administered orally daily with food for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period 
given  as 3 week  cycles. The XELODA daily dose  is given orally  in two divided doses 
(approximately  12  hours  apart)  at  the  end  of  a  meal.  XELODA  tablets  should  be 
swallowed with water. The following table displays the total daily dose by body surface 
area and the number of tablets to be taken at each dose.

*Total Daily Dose divided by 2 to allow equal morning and evening doses. 
Dose  Modification  Guidelines:  Patients  should  be  carefully  monitored  for  toxicity. 
Toxicity  due  to  XELODA  administration  may  be  managed  by  symptomatic  treatment, 
dose interruptions and adjustment of XELODA dose. Once the dose has been reduced it 
should not be increased at a later time. 
The  phenytoin  dose  may  need  to  be  reduced  when  phenytoin  is  concomitantly 
administered with XELODA (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Drug Interactions).

*National Cancer Institute of Canada Common Toxicity Criteria were used except for the 
Hand and-Foot Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS). 
Dosage modifications are not recommended for grade 1 events. Therapy with XELODA 
should be interrupted upon the occurrence of a grade 2 or 3 adverse experience. Once the 
adverse event has resolved or decreased  in  intensity to grade 1, then XELODA therapy 
may  be  restarted  at  full  dose  or  as  adjusted  according  to  the  above  table.  If  a  grade  4 
experience  occurs,  therapy  should  be  discontinued  or  interrupted  until  resolved  or 
decreased to grade 1, and therapy should be restarted at 50% of the original dose. Doses of 
capecitabine omitted  for toxicity  are not replaced or restored;  instead the patient should 
resume the planned treatment cycles. 
Adjustment of Starting Dose in Special Populations: 
Hepatic Impairment: In patients with  mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver 
metastases, no starting dose adjustment is necessary; however, patients should be carefully 
monitored. Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction have not been studied. 
Renal  Impairment:  Insufficient  data  are  available  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  to 
provide a dosage recommendation. 
Geriatrics: The elderly may be pharmacodynamically more sensitive to the toxic effects of 
5-FU  and  therefore,  physicians  should  exercise  caution  in  monitoring  the  effects  of 
XELODA 
to  provide  a  dosage 
recommendation.

APPENDIX 8: CAPECITABINE PATIENT INFORMATION 

XELODA® (capecitabine) 

 
If caught early, most of these side effects usually improve within 2 to 3 days after you stop 
taking XELODA. If they don’t improve within 2 to 3 days, call your doctor again. After side 
effects have improved, your doctor will tell you whether to start taking XELODA again or 
what dose to use. 
How should I store and use XELODA? 
•  Never share XELODA with anyone. 
•  XELODA should be stored at normal room temperature (about 65° to 85°F). 
•  Keep this and all other medications out of the reach of children. 
•  In case of accidental ingestion or if you suspect that more than the prescribed dose of this 
medication  has  been  taken,  contact  your  doctor  or  local  poison  control  center  or 
emergency room IMMEDIATELY. 

•  Medicines are sometimes prescribed for uses other than those listed in this leaflet. If you 
have any questions or concerns, or want more information about XELODA, contact your 
doctor or pharmacist.

PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT (text only): 

Patient Information About XELODA® (capecitabine) Tablets 

This  information  will  help  you  learn  more  about  XELODA®  (capecitabine)  Tablets.  It 
cannot, however, cover all possible precautions  or side effects associated with XELODA 
nor does it list all the benefits and risks of XELODA. Your doctor should always be your 
first choice for detailed information about your medical condition and your treatment. Be 
sure to ask your doctor about any questions you may have. 
What is XELODA? 
•  XELODA  [zeh-LOE-duh]  is  an  oral  medication  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  breast 
cancer resistant to treatment with paclitaxel [pak-lih-TAK-sil] and an anthracycline [ann-
thruh-SYEkleen]-containing chemotherapy regimen. Paclitaxel is also known as Taxol®*. 
Anthracyclines include Adriamycin®† or doxorubicin. 

•  XELODA tablets come in two strengths: 150 mg (light peach) and 500 mg (peach). 
How does XELODA work? 
XELODA  is converted in the  body to the substance 5-fluorouracil. In some patients, this 
substance kills cancer cells and decreases the size of the tumor. 
Who should not take XELODA? 
•  Patients allergic to 5-fluorouracil. 
•  Studies in animals suggest that XELODA may cause serious harm to an unborn child. No 
studies have been done with pregnant women. If you are pregnant, be sure to discuss with 
your doctor whether XELODA is right for you. Also, tell your doctor if you are nursing. 

How should I take XELODA? 
Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. Your doctor 
may  want  you  to  take  a  combination  of  150  mg  and  500  mg  tablets  for  each  dose.  If  a 
combination  of  tablets  is  prescribed,  it  is  very  important  that  you  correctly  identify  the 
tablets.  Taking  the  wrong  tablets  could  result  in  an  overdose  (too  much  medication)  or 
underdose (too little medication). The 150 mg tablets are light peach in color and have 150 
engraved on one side. The 500 mg tablets are peach in color and have 500 engraved on one 
side. 
•  Take  the  tablets  in  the  combination  prescribed  by  your  doctor  for  your  morning  and 

evening doses. 

•  Take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner). 
•  XELODA tablets should be swallowed with water. 
•  It is important that you take all your medication as prescribed by your doctor. 
•  If you are taking the vitamin folic acid, please inform your doctor. 
•  If you are taking phenytoin (also known as Dilantin®‡), please inform your doctor. Your 
doctor  may  need  to  more  frequently  test  the  levels  of  phenytoin  in  your  blood  and/or 
change the dose of phenytoin that you are taking. 

•  If you are taking warfarin (also known as Coumadin®§), please inform your doctor. Your 

doctor may need to more frequently check how quickly your blood is clotting. 

How long will I have to take XELODA? 
It is recommended that XELODA be taken for 14 days followed by a 7-day 
rest period (no drug) given as a 21-day cycle. Your doctor will determine how many cycles 
of treatment you will need. 
What if I miss a dose? 
If you miss a dose of XELODA, do not take the missed dose at all and do not double the 
next one. Instead, continue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor. 
What are the most common side effects of XELODA? 
The most common side effects of XELODA are: 
•  diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting,  stomatitis  (sores  in  mouth  and  throat),  abdominal  pain, 
constipation, loss of appetite or decreased appetite, and dehydration (excessive water loss 
from the body). 

•  hand-and-foot syndrome (palms of the hands or soles of the feet tingle, become numb, 

painful, swollen or red), rash, dry or itchy skin. 

•  tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, and fever. 
When should I call my doctor? 
It  is  important  that  you  CONTACT  YOUR  DOCTOR  IMMEDIATELY  if  you 
experience  the  following  side  effects.  This  will  help  reduce  the  likelihood  that  the  side 
effect will continue or become serious. Your doctor may instruct you to decrease the dose 
and/or temporarily discontinue treatment with XELODA. 
STOP  taking  XELODA  immediately  and  contact  your  doctor  if  any  of  these  symptoms 
occur: 
•  Diarrhea: if you have more than 4 bowel movements each day or any diarrhea at night. 
•  Vomiting: if you vomit more than once in a 24-hour time period. 
•  Nausea: if you lose your appetite, and the amount of food you eat each day is much less 

•  Stomatitis: if you have pain, redness, swelling, or sores in your mouth. 
•  Hand-and-foot syndrome: if you have pain, swelling or redness of hands and/or feet. 
•  Fever or Infection: if you have a temperature of 100.5°F or greater, or other evidence of
