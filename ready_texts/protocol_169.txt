Study Title:
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Abiraterone Acetate 
(CB7630) Plus Prednisone in Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Patients with Metastatic 
Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Study Number:
COU-AA-302
Study Phase: 3
Primary Objective:

 To  compare  the  clinical  benefit  of  abiraterone acetate  plus  prednisone  versus
placebo  plus  prednisone  in  patients  with  chemotherapy-naïve  castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic

Secondary Objectives:

 To establish additional clinically relevant improvements in prostate cancer patients 

treated with abiraterone acetate in comparison to placebo 

 To characterize the safety profile of abiraterone acetate in this patient population
 To  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  of  abiraterone  acetate  when  administered 

concurrently with prednisone

Study Design: 
This study is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study 
with a randomization allocation ratio of 1:1 between the abiraterone acetate group and the 
placebo group. Abiraterone acetate and placebo tablets will be referred to as study drug in a 
blinded fashion.  Patients randomized to the abiraterone acetate group will receive a dose of 
1000 mg daily (QD).  Study drug will be administered as 4 x 250-mg abiraterone acetate 
tablets or 4 placebo tablets. Prednisone will be administered as 5 mg orally twice a day (bid) 
for both groups.
Randomization will be stratified according to the following:

 ECOG performance status: 0 versus 1

Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302

December 17, 2013

The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed the efficacy and safety data 
from the interim analysis of overall survival (OS) (43% of death events). The IDMC 
concluded that all of the data pointed to a significant advantage for patients in one arm of the 
study compared with the other arm. The IDMC unanimously recommended stopping the 
study, unblinding, and allowing crossover from the placebo arm to active therapy. A brief 
summary of the efficacy and safety data is provided in Appendix 11. Patients currently 
receiving placebo will be offered crossover therapy to abiraterone acetate as outlined in 
Appendix 11. Patients who were on placebo and are now in long-term follow-up will also be 
offered abiraterone acetate as outlined in Appendix 12. The Schedule of Events for patients 
who were originally randomized to the abiraterone acetate treatment group will not change.
Study COU-AA-302 was designed to perform the final OS analysis after approximately 
773 death events had occurred. At the time of clinical cut off for the final analysis (CCO-FA) 
for OS, patients will be discontinued from long term follow-up. Patients still receiving 
abiraterone acetate at the time of this CCO-FA will be offered continued treatment for an 
additional period of up to 3 years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (as 
outlined in Appendix 13). For these patients safety assessment, consisting of collection of 
Serious Adverse Events, as outlined in the Schedule of Events provided in Appendix 13 will 
be performed while continuing treatment, and for 30 days after the last dose of abiraterone 
acetate.
Study Population:
Approximately 1,000 medically or surgically castrated male patients with metastatic CRPC 
who have shown tumor progression and are non- or mildly-symptomatic will be enrolled 
from approximately 150 global study sites.
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:
Abiraterone acetate (CB7630), 1000 mg/day (4 x 250-mg tablets), or matching placebo given 
orally
Duration of Treatment:
Patients will have a screening period of up to 14 days prior to randomization on Cycle 1 
Day 1.  Each cycle consists of 28 days.  Patients will be treated until disease progression as 
defined in the protocol. After discontinuing study treatment, patients will be contacted once 
every three months up to 60 months (5 years) for survival follow-up. In addition to overall 
survival, opiate use, ECOG performance status, and next therapy for prostate cancer 
(including dose and treatment duration of cytotoxic chemotherapy) will also be collected.

Abiraterone Acetate (CB7630)
Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302
Efficacy Assessment:
The primary efficacy endpoints are OS and Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) 
(co-primary). 

December 17, 2013

 Efficacy assessment in rPFS will utilize sequential imaging studies as defined by 

PCWG2 and modified RECIST criteria. 

 Survival  data  will  be  collected  throughout  the  study  treatment  phase  and  during 

follow-up.

Secondary efficacy assessments: 

 Time to opiate use for cancer-related pain and time to administration of cytotoxic 

chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer will be prospectively assessed. 

 ECOG performance status will be evaluated throughout the study to assess time to 

first deterioration. 

PSA values will be collected throughout the study to assess time to PSA progression. 
Safety Assessments:

 Medical history, vital sign measurements, physical examination, and body weight
 Concomitant therapy and procedures
 Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including laboratory test 
AEs  will  be  graded  and  summarized  according  to the  National  Cancer  Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0 

 Blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation studies, serum lipids, and urinalysis
 Electrocardiograms (ECGs)

Other Assessments:

 Quality of Life (QoL) using FACT-P Quality of Life questionnaire
 Medical resource utilization (MRU) information
 PK measurements at selected sites

TMPRSS2-ERG and other biomarkers in primary tumor or in circulating tumor cells (CTC’s) 
at selected sites

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer

December 17, 2013

Prostate cancer has become an increasingly important health issue globally.  With 679,060 
men diagnosed each year, prostate cancers are the fifth most common tumor type worldwide 
[1].    It  is  estimated  by  the  American  Cancer Society  that  in  2008,  prostate  cancer  will  be 
diagnosed in 186,320 men in the United States alone and that 28,660 will die [2].

The most significant morbidity of prostate cancer is bone metastasis.  It develops initially in 
the axial skeleton and later in the appendicular skeleton [3] in advanced prostate cancer and 
metastasis to bone is present in > 90% of patients [4].  These lesions can cause pain, skeletal 
fractures,  spinal cord  compression,  anemia  and  thrombocytopenia.    Clinical  sequelae  can 
include pain, paralysis, diminished mobility, fatigue and increased risk of infections.  Side 
effects such as constipation and delirium from analgesics required to palliate pain are also 
significant.  They further compromise patient quality of life. 

In  addition,  soft  tissue  metastasis  occurs  in  about  40%  of  advanced  patients.    Pelvic 
lymphadenopathy may lead to anatomic obstruction of the ureters, or fistula formation [4]. 
When tumor recurs in the prostate gland or bed, urethral obstruction may also ensue.

Prostate cancer is hormone sensitive at the time of initial diagnosis.  Although most patients 
with advanced metastatic disease initially respond to conventional androgen deprivation with 
medical [5] or surgical [6] castration, the median duration of disease control has been 13 to 
22 months and overall survival 28-36 months [7].  The clinical status of patients after failure 
of  castration  is  commonly  referred  to  as  hormone-refractory  prostate  cancer  (HRPC),  or 
androgen-independent  prostate  cancer  (AIPC).    However,  recent  investigations  have 
established that tumor progression often remains androgen-dependent albeit at much reduced 
systemic  androgen  levels  after  castration.    Although  used  widely  in  clinical  settings,  the 
terms  HRPC  and  AIPC  do  not  reflect  the  biology  of  advanced  prostate  cancer  where 
androgen  receptor (AR) and  its  ligand  remain  pivotal  in  tumor  growth.    Prostate  cancer 
progression after conventional medical or surgical castration should, therefore, be considered 
castration-resistant prostate  cancer  (CRPC).  Patients  with  metastatic  CRPC  have  a  very 
limited life expectancy and most often die of their prostate cancer.

In the castrate state, ligands to the AR have been thought to be derived primarily from the 
adrenal  glands.    Conventional  androgen  deprivation  therapy  removes  90%  of  circulating 
androgens produced in the gonads.  As much as 10% of circulating testosterone remains, in 
part due to the peripheral conversion of adrenal steroids to testosterone.  In addition, several 
recent studies suggest that androgen levels in the microenvironment of prostate cancer may 
be  maintained  in  spite  of  reduced  systemic  levels  [8,9]. In  patients  with  castrate  levels  of 
testosterone, 
levels  of  dehydroepiandrosterone,  dihydrotestosterone,  and 
androstenedione  all  remain  sufficient  to  activate  the  AR.    Furthermore,  the  ARs  are 
predominately  located  in  the  nucleus  in  biopsy  tissue,  indicating  ligand-binding  and  the 
activation  of  androgen-dependent  gene  expression.    Increased  expression  of  the  AR  is 
common  in  advanced  prostate  cancer,  and  allows  lower  ligand  levels  to  more  strongly 
activate the AR [10].  A recent investigation made the observation that in high risk primary

prostate tumors and in metastatic biopsies, CYP17A1 gene expression is highly upregulated 
[11], suggesting the possibility of in situ production of androgens as autocrine or paracrine 
growth  factors  despite  castration [12].    Similarly,  investigators  at  MD  Anderson  Cancer 
Center also detected CYP17 expression by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow metastasis 
in CRPC [13]. Although these preliminary findings require further corroborating evidence, 
the  need  to  suppress  androgen  production  in  adrenal  glands  and  possibly  at  tissue  levels 
persists in CRPC.

Complete androgen independence in CRPC is thought to be rare.  A few patients (9%) have 
mutations in the AR [14]; these changes could allow the AR to be activated by non-androgen 
ligands, or might allow ligand-independent AR association with coactivator molecules.  

Although  gene  fusions  are  well  known  to  drive  the  development  of  blood  cancers  and 
sarcomas, only rarely have they been detected in the common solid cancers.  Recent evidence 
indicates  that  a  gene  fusion  may  be  important  in  the  pathogenesis  of  prostate  carcinoma
[15,16,17,18,19].  Chromosomal  translocations involving  the  androgen-responsive  gene 
transmembrane protease  serine  2  (TMPRSS2) and  erythroblast  transformation–specific
(ETS)-related transcription factors ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, have been identified in 50% to 
70% of prostate cancer cases [15,16]. Translocation of TMPRSS2 to the ERG gene, found in 
a  high  proportion  of  human  prostate  cancer,  results  in  overexpression  of  the  3'-ERG 
sequences joined to the 5'-TMPRSS2 promoter.  ERG and other ETS family members are
transcription factors that are implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation and 
the  chimeric  protein  product  of  the  gene  translocation  appears  to  retain  hormone-
responsiveness [17].   Specific translocations in primary tumors have been associated with 
more  aggressive  natural  clinical  history,  more  advanced  disease at  diagnosis  and  greater 
lethality [18,19,20,21].  These gene rearrangements may be associated with tumor response to 
androgen deprivation therapy, including abiraterone [22].
1.2 Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Patients with Castrate 

Resistant Prostate Cancer

Approximately  50%  of  patients  with  metastatic  prostate  cancer  will  have  no  noticeable 
symptoms  related  to  the  tumor  [23].  The  optimal  management  of  these  patients  with 
asymptomatic  or  mildly  symptomatic  metastatic  prostate  cancer  refractory  to  medical  or 
surgical  castration  remains  undefined  [24]. There  are  no  approved  second-line  hormonal 
therapies  for  this  population,  and  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  (docetaxel  or  mitoxantrone)  is 
ordinarily  reserved  for  patients  with  symptomatic  or  rapidly  progressive  cancer [25]. The 
American Society of Clinical Oncology / Cancer Care of Ontario and EAU guidelines for the 
cytotoxic  treatment  of  CRPC [26,27] emphasize  the  need  to  individualize  the  timing  of 
nonhormonal therapy for prostate cancer and consider routine docetaxel questionable in men 
who have metastatic disease but lack symptoms. Similarly, the current ESMO guidelines [28] 
for metastatic prostate cancer recommend that patients with castrate-resistant disease should 
receive  second  and  possibly  third  line  hormonal  therapies,  while chemotherapy  with 
docetaxel  given  every  three  weeks  should  be  considered  for  patients  with  CRPC  who  are 
symptomatic [28].  Thus  the  non-cytotoxic  treatment  of  patients  with  CRPC  who  are 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic remains a significant unmet medical need.

Patients  with  metastatic  CRPC  who  are  not  good  candidates  for  immediate  chemotherapy 
may still benefit from alternate therapies since they develop symptomatic disease progression 
in  a  short  period  of  time.    This  adverse  natural  history  of  patients  with  asymptomatic  or 
mildly symptomatic CRPC was documented in two recent Phase III trials of novel agents in 
this population. A multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [29] of the endothelin 
antagonist atrasentan in patients with metastatic CRPC who had not received chemotherapy 
and  did  not  require  opiates  for  cancer  related  pain enrolled  809  men.  Patients  were 
randomized 1:1 to receive either atrasentan 10 mg per day or placebo. The primary endpoint 
was time to disease progression (TTP), which was determined according to radiographic and 
clinical  measures.  Analyses  of  overall  survival  and  changes  in  biomarkers  also  were 
performed.  Greater  than  50%  of  patients  on  both  the  experimental  and  control  arms 
developed protocol defined progression in less than 100 days, with 87% of the progressions 
by radiographic criteria. In addition more than half of patients on the control arm had a 50% 
worsening  of  the Pain  Catastrophizing  Scale (PCS) pain  score  within  12  months  of  study 
entry, primarily due to increasingly painful bone metastases [30]. The median survival was 
20.5 months for atrasentan treated patients and 20.3 months for the control patients. A second 
smaller  Phase  III  study  [31]  compared  the  investigational  immunotherapy  product 
Sipuleucel-T  with  placebo  in  patients  with  CRPC  who  had  not  received  chemotherapy. 
Patients with cancer-related bone pain, those requiring opioid analgesics for cancer pain, and 
those  with  visceral  metastases  were  not eligible.  Disease  progression  events  included 
radiographic  progression,  cancer  pain,  and  clinical  events,  with  the  great  majority 
radiographic.  The  median  for  time  to  disease  progression (TTP)  for  Sipuleucel-T  was 
11.7 weeks  compared  with  10.0  weeks for  placebo.  Median  survival  was  25.9  months  for 
Sipuleucel-T and  21.4  months  for  placebo.  These  results  demonstrate  that  patients  with 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic CRPC have short times to disease progression and to 
the rapid appearance of painful metastases, with an approximate overall survival of two years 
or less. Therefore the development of an alternate non-cytotoxic therapy with an improved 
safety  and  toxicity  profile,  capable  of  delaying  tumor  progression,  blocking  onset  or 
worsening of pain, and improving survival would be of significant clinical benefit to patients 
with CRPC.

The current study is focused on patients with progressive CRPC who are not in immediate 
need of docetaxel or mitoxantrone due to their lack of moderate to severe bone pain or rapid 
tumor progression. Patients will be required to have a score of 3 or less on components of 
the  Brief  Pain  Intensity  Short  Form.  Additionally,  opiate  use  for  cancer  related  pain  is 
prohibited at study entry. Outside of a clinical trial, these mildly symptomatic patients with 
CRPC  would  commonly  be  treated  with  unapproved  second-line  hormonal  therapies  (see 
Section 1.3).
1.3 Second line hormonal therapies for CRPC

Second  line  hormonal  therapies  in  prostate  cancer  have  limited  efficacy, and  none  have 
received regulatory approval for this use.  Historically, bilateral adrenalectomy was the first 
second line hormonal therapy to be evaluated [32].  Several of the adrenalectomized patients 
with  widespread  bone  metastases  had  decreases  in  the  bulkiness  of  their  prostate  tumor, 
reductions in prostatic acid phosphatase levels, increases in hemoglobin and red blood cell 
levels, and strikingly, 5 of 7 patients had complete relief of their cancer pain within 48 hours

of the surgery.  However, patient and physician acceptance of adrenalectomy was low, due to 
the morbidity of major surgery in an advanced stage cancer patient population.  

1.3.1 Adrenal Androgen Inhibitor

Historical attempts to obtain the benefits of total adrenalectomy medically without the side 
effects of surgery have met with limited success.  Aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole both 
inhibit  several  adrenal  enzymes  involved  with  adrenal  androgen  synthesis.    Modest 
therapeutic  activities  on  prostate  cancer  were observed.    However,  the  side  effects  were 
significant.  For example, in combination with hydrocortisone, aminoglutethimide resulted in 
a PSA response proportion of 37% with the median duration for responders of nine months in 
a  Phase  2  study  [33] at  the  expense  of  lethargy,  skin  rash,  hypothyroidism,  nausea  and 
vomiting.  Its use has been limited [33,34].  

Ketoconazole inhibits several adrenal enzymes required for steroid biosynthesis.  Its efficacy 
in  prostate  cancer  in  terms  of  PSA  response  is  comparable  to  that  of  aminoglutethimide.  
Pilot studies in patients after failure of combined androgen blockade where ketoconazole was 
given simultaneously with anti-androgen withdrawal (AAWD) showed that 55% of patients 
achieved a 50% PSA decline [35].  When administered after AAWD, 36%-62.5% of patients 
had  a  50%  PSA  decline  [36,37].  In  a  Phase  3  study  conducted  by  Cancer  and  Leukemia 
Group B, PSA response rate was 27% with a median duration of response of 9 months in the 
group  of  patients  randomized  to  the  combination  arm  of  AAWD  and  ketoconazole  plus 
hydrocortisone  versus  the  AAWD  alone  arm  [38].    However,  ketoconazole  inhibits 
cytochrome  P450  3A4 (CYP3A4) with  substantial  risk  of  drug-drug  interactions,  such  as 
warfarin and statins [39].  It is often poorly tolerated by patients, with commonly occurring 
side effects including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and depression [36,37,38].  Ketoconazole is 
not approved for the treatment of CRPC.

1.3.2 Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids  appear  to  possess  both  hormonal  and  direct  anti-tumor  effects  in  prostate 
cancer. Patients with CRPC may still have hormone-sensitive disease that is stimulated by 
weak androgens of adrenal origin, and these androgens are suppressed by prednisone through 
its negative feedback on secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Tannock et al 
[40]  have  demonstrated  that  low-dose  prednisone  treatment  (7.5  to  10  mg  daily)  led  to  a 
decrease in the concentration of serum testosterone in seven of nine patients where it was not 
initially  suppressed  below  2.0  nmol/mL,  and  caused  a  decrease  in  serum  levels  of 
androstenedione  and  dehydroepiandrosterone  sulfate  in  more  than  50%  of  patients.  These 
changes were associated with symptomatic and clinical improvement. Glucocorticoids may 
also  have  direct  inhibitory  effects  on  prostate  cancer  cells  through  enhanced growth-
inhibitory  TGF-ß1 signaling  and  suppression  of  the  transcriptional  activities of  NF–κB. 
[41,42].

Prednisone,  dexamethasone,  and  hydrocortisone  have  been  frequently  administered  as 
standard of care in advanced prostate cancer because of their modest antitumor activity and 
palliative effects on disease.  Two prospective Phase 3 studies have documented the adverse 
event profile and palliative benefit of prednisone.  Prednisone 7.5-10 mg daily was examined

among 81 patients in one arm of a Phase 3 trial, with 22% of patients achieving a 50% PSA 
decline  and  a  median  time  to  progression  of  4.0 months  [43]. Likewise,  in  a  randomized 
study control arm where 201 patients were treated with prednisone 5 mg twice daily, PSA 
decline of ≥ 50% was observed in 21% of patients [44].  Significant improvements in pain, 
quality of life and fatigue were also reported. 

Other glucocorticoids have similar activity in advanced prostate cancer.  Hydrocortisone has 
been evaluated as a control arm in prospective Phase 3 studies.  In one study, 231 patients 
treated with hydrocortisone alone (control arm) showed that 16% of patients achieved a PSA 
decline of ≥50% with a median duration of response of 2.5 months [45].  Similarly, 14% of 
patients given hydrocortisone 40 mg daily achieved a PSA decline ≥ 50% lasting a median of 
2.3 months in a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study [46]. The antitumor activity 
of  hydrocortisone  was  slightly  lower  than  prednisone  in  these  Phase  3  studies  (14%-16% 
PSA  response  rate  for  hydrocortisone  versus  21%-22%  PSA  response  rate  for  prednisone; 
median  duration  of  response  also  favored  prednisone).    Likewise, dexamethasone  has 
antitumor  activity  in  prostate  cancer  [47,48,49].  No  prostate  cancer  trials  have  directly 
compared 2 glucocorticoids. 

1.3.3 Estrogens

Prostate cancer normally expresses estrogen receptors, and estrogenic compounds have been 
used  for  the  treatment  of  CRPC.  The  most  commonly  used  estrogen  is  diethylstilbestrol 
(DES),  although  DES-diphosphate,  and  the  herbal  phytoestrogenic  supplement,  PC-SPES, 
have also been investigated in clinical trials.

Recently,  DES  has  been  evaluated  in  two  studies [50,51]  including  21  and  32  patients.  A 
positive PSA response was achieved in 43% and 80%, respectively; the estimated survival at 
2 years was 63%.  However, even at low doses, 31% of the patients developed deep venous 
thrombosis and 7% experienced myocardial infarction.  In another prospective randomized 
phase II trial, the clinical efficacy of the herbal supplement PC-SPES and DES were tested in 
a cohort of 90 patients, with PSA progression following initial androgen deprivation [52].  A 
PSA decline > 50% was noted in 40% with PC-SPES and in 24% with DES. Median time to 
progression was 5.5 months with PC-SPES and 2.9 months with DES; the differences were 
statistically not significant.

Although estrogens remain an option for the secondary hormonal treatment of CRPC, their 
use is limited by concerns regarding cardiovascular toxicity [27].
1.4 Chemotherapy and Bisphosphonates for CRPC

Several agents have been approved as palliative therapy for prostate cancer.  Estramustine 
was  approved  in  the  1970s.    However,  in  a  randomized  study  where  overall  survival  was 
compared,  diethystilbesterol  was  found to  be  superior  to  estramustine  [53]. 
In  1996, 
mitoxantrone and prednisone were approved in the United States for palliation of pain and 
improvement  in  quality  of  life  in  a  randomized  study  with  prednisone  as  control  [43].  
However,  there  was  no  survival  benefit.    Recently,  zoledronic  acid  was approved  for

reduction in skeletal morbidity in solid tumors, including prostate cancer [54].  None of these 
agents improved the overall or prostate cancer-specific survival of patients with CRPC.

Docetaxel  is  the  only  agent  to  date  that  has  demonstrated  a  survival  benefit  in  CRPC. A
3-weekly docetaxel regimen had a median overall survival of 18.9 months (95% confidence 
interval  17.0  – 21.2),  compared  with  the  mitoxantrone  control  arm  of  16.5  months  (95% 
confidence  interval  14.4  – 18.6  months).    The  hazard  ratio  for  death  was  0.76  (95% 
confidence interval 0.62 – 0.94, p =0.009) in the docetaxel regimen as compared with control 
[55]. 

Results from the SWOG Study 99-16 trial of 770 men (3-weekly docetaxel + estramustine + 
dexamethasone vs mitoxantrone + prednisone [56]), median overall survival 17.5 months  vs 
15.6 months, respectively, p=0.02 were consistent with the TAX-327 data.  

Results  from  TAX-327  were  updated  at  ASCO  2007.    Overall  survival  results were 
maintained after the additional 2 years of follow-up and an additional 276 deaths [57].  The 
median  survival  in  the  docetaxel  3-weekly  arm  and  mitoxantrone  arms  were  the  same  as 
previously reported in 2004, 18.9 months (95% confidence interval 17.0-21.2) for docetaxel 
every  3  weeks  plus  prednisone,  and  16.5  months  (95%  confidence  interval  14.4-18.6)  for 
mitoxantrone plus prednisone.  In an exploratory subset analysis, benefit was seen in patients 
who were free of pain at the time therapy was initiated.  However, this analysis confirmed 
only  consistency  of  effect  across  subpopulations,  and  the  study  was  not  powered  to 
demonstrate survival advantage in asymptomatic patients.  Also, the similar benefit produced 
by docetaxel treatment in patients with or without pain suggests that holding chemotherapy 
in reserve for asymptomatic patients is a reasonable option.  
1.5 Abiraterone Acetate (CB7630) and the Active Metabolite Abiraterone 

(CB7598)

Abiraterone (CB7598) is [17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-5,16-dien-3β-ol] and is a steroidal inhibitor 
of CYP17 (17α hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase) that blocks two important enzymatic activities in 
the synthesis of testosterone (Figure 1), based on the observation that nonsteroidal 3 pyridyl 
esters improve selectivity for inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20 lyase.  Abiraterone is a 
potent inhibitor with an apparent inhibition constant of 0.5 nM.  Pharmacodynamic studies 
demonstrated that its effects on adrenal steroid synthesis were consistent with its mechanism 
of  action.    Antitumor  effects  were  evident  with  PSA  response  and  durable  objective 
responses using Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria [58] in Phase 
1 and Phase 2 studies conducted to date.

Abiraterone acetate (CB7630) is the 3-acetylated analog of abiraterone and thus a pro-drug of 
abiraterone.    The  chemical  nomenclature  of  abiraterone  acetate  is  3β  acetoxy-17-(3-
pyridyl)androsta-5,16-diene;  its  empirical  formula  is  C26H33NO2 and  molecular  weight  is 
391.55.  Once absorbed after oral administration, abiraterone acetate is rapidly converted to 
the  active  form,  abiraterone (Figure  2). 
In  initial  research  studies,  abiraterone  was  the 
predominant,  if  not  the  only, metabolite  of  abiraterone  acetate  detected  in  blood, both  in 
preclinical studies [59] and in previously conducted clinical studies [60].

Absorption

1.5.1 Dosing Rationale

The dose of abiraterone acetate in this study is 1000 mg daily based on results of two Phase 1 
dose-finding  studies.    In  the  first  Phase  1  study  with  capsule  formulation  (COU-AA-001) 
[61],  abiraterone  acetate  was  evaluated  for  safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and  its  effects  on 
adrenal  steroid  synthesis  at  dose  levels  ranging  from  250  mg  to  2000  mg.    Preliminary 
analysis showed that abiraterone acetate  had an acceptable safety profile at all dose levels.  
Patients have received abiraterone acetate in  this study and an extension protocol  for up to 
30 months.  In the second Phase 1 study (COU-AA-002) [62,63] that evaluated the safety and 
tolerability of abiraterone acetate tablet formulation at doses ranging from 250 to 1000 mg, a 
daily dose of 1000 mg has also been  found to have an acceptable safety profile for further 
development.

Consistent  with  abiraterone  acetate’s  mechanism  of  action,  hypertension  (HTN), 
hypokalemia,  and  lower  extremity  edema  were  the  most  commonly-observed  drug-related 
adverse events, which were all manageable with medication.  Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies 
showed  increased  systemic  drug  exposure  at  higher  doses.    Adrenal  metabolite  analysis 
showed inhibition of CYP17 even at low doses of abiraterone acetate and a compensatory 
increase of corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone.  Data from dose-finding studies indicated 
that when PK, adrenal CYP17 inhibition, and efficacy signals are taken into consideration, 
the 1000-mg dose offered consistent pharmacological effects without additional side effects.  
Therefore, the 1000-mg dose has been chosen for further efficacy and safety evaluation in 
this Phase 3 study.

1.5.2

Concurrent Prednisone 

In  ongoing  studies,  some  patients  receiving  abiraterone  acetate  have  been  treated 
concurrently with glucocorticoids, including prednisone. 

Data from early studies have contributed to the current understanding of the mechanism of 
abiraterone  action.  These  suggest that  a  state  of  mineralocorticoid  excess  can  occur  after 
pharmacologic inhibition of CYP17, with the resulting reduced cortisol levels leading to a 
compensatory  ACTH  surge  and  accompanying  hypertension,  hypokalemia,  and  fluid 
retention  [64]. These  side  effects  were  readily  managed  with  potassium  supplementation, 
eplerenone  (selective  mineralocorticoid  antagonist),  antihypertensive  agents,  and  low  dose 
corticosteroids.  Grade 1-2 fatigue was observed in some patients and was associated with 
discontinuation of corticosteroids as required per Phase 2 protocol entry criteria and extended 
duration  of  treatment  with  abiraterone  acetate.    Although  there  was  no  evidence  of  an 
abiraterone dose-response  relationship,  administration  of  low  dose  cortiscosteroids  as 
specified in the study improved symptoms of fatigue and tolerability of abiraterone acetate, 
including  symptoms  of  mineralocorticosteroid  excess.    The  improved  tolerability  of 
abiraterone  acetate  after  concomitant  administration  of  low-dose  corticosteroids  was 
associated  with  suppression  of  ACTH  and  upstream  adrenal  steroids,  suggesting  that  this 
combination  may  be  a  better  tolerated  and  safer  regimen  in  this  older  and  frail  patient 
population.  Prednisone was selected over other corticosteroids because it is commonly used 
as  standard  of  care  [27]  in  combination  with  approved  chemotherapy  agents  or  as  a 
monotherapy for palliation of symptoms.  The safety and efficacy evaluation of abiraterone 
acetate  with  concurrently  administered  prednisone  is  continuing  in  ongoing  Phase 2  and  3 
studies.  The regimen of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily and low dose prednisone 5-mg 
twice daily has been chosen as the experimental intervention arm in this study.

1.5.3

Status of Current Clinical Trials of Abiraterone Acetate

Over two hundred seventy (270) patients have been treated to date with abiraterone acetate in 
Phase I and II studies, with approximately 240 patients at the 1000-mg dose level.  

1.5.3.1

Chemotherapy-Naïve Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)

Following  selection  of  the  1000-mg  dosing  regimen,  the  COU-AA-001  study  enrolled 
additional  patients  to  further  evaluate  antitumor  activity  in  chemotherapy-naïve  CRPC

patients.    Chemotherapy-naïve  men  (n  =  54)  with  CRPC  resistant  to  multiple  hormonal 
therapies were treated in this two-stage phase I/II study.   Declines in PSA ≥ 30%, ≥ 50% and 
≥  90%  were  observed in  43  (80%),  38  (70%)  and  14  (24%)  of patients respectively. 
Radiological  evaluation  reported  disease  regression  by  RECIST  (CR  or  PR)  in  52%  of 
patients.  Falls in circulating tumor cell counts [65], normalization of lactate dehydrogenase 
and  improving  symptoms  with  a  reduction  in  analgesic  use  were  commonly  documented.
Twenty-three patients have received abiraterone acetate capsules for more than 12 months as 
part  of  an  extension  protocol  [58,66].  Similar  responses  rates  have  been  seen  in 
COU-AA-002, a parallel Phase I/II study investigating a tablet formulation [67].

1.5.3.2

Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Post-Docetaxel

Two Phase 2 studies (COU-AA-003 and COU-AA-004) in post-docetaxel CRPC patients are 
also being conducted.  Preliminary results are available from the COU-AA-003 study.  Forty-
seven evaluable patients have been recruited.  In an analysis of 28 patients, 14 have achieved 
PSA  declines  ≥  50%  and  the  median  time  to  PSA  progression  is  167  days  (24 weeks).  
Eighteen patients had measurable lesions at baseline and 4 (22%) of these had a confirmed 
radiologic PR.  Eleven patients have been on treatment for more than a year.  To date, no 
relationship  has  been  found  between  true  progression  on  prior  docetaxel  chemotherapy  or 
stopping docetaxel for another reason such as toxicity, and response to abiraterone.  (Refer to 
the  current  version  of  the  abiraterone  acetate  Investigator’s  Brochure  for  additional  or 
updated information).
1.6 Clinical Benefits of Current Treatment

1.6.1 Quality of Life Assessments

Observational  studies  have  documented  a  rapid  decline  in  health  status  in  CRPC.    A 
population-based sample of 1,243 patients was followed in Sweden during the year prior to 
their death from prostate cancer using the brief pain inventory short form (BPI-SF) and the 
Euro EQ-5D quality of life survey instruments.  Declines across scales were highest in the 
8 months preceding death [68].  Similarly, Litwin et al [69] and Melmed et al [70] assessed 
qualify of life (QOL) in metastatic prostate cancer patients in Cancer of the Prostate Strategic 
Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database from the United States.  Declines across 
all 8 domains measured by the SF-36 were found during the 12 months prior to death.  

In contrast to observational studies, the TAX-327 interventional study found that global QOL 
measured by the FACT-P was improved for both docetaxel regimens [55], although only the 
3-weekly  docetaxel  arm  had  improved  survival  over  mitoxantrone  in  this  study.    In  the 
SWOG  99-16  study,  a  significant  survival  advantage  was  found  for  docetaxel  plus 
estramustine  compared  with  mitoxantrone  and  prednisone;  QOL  was  assessed  with  the 
EORTC-QLQ-C30 instrument and the prostate subscale PR25 QOL [71] and pain palliation 
did  not  favor  either  study  arm.    In  the  Canadian  study  comparing  mitoxantrone  and 
prednisone with prednisone alone in advanced prostate cancer, the PROSQOLI and EORTC 
QLQ-C30 and prostate specific subscale QOLM-P14 were used, demonstrating that patients 
in the mitoxantrone arm had greater and longer lasting improvements in QOL [72].

Though there is no consensus on the best QOL instrument to use in interventional trials, the 
FACT-P has been selected for use in this trial based on several factors: 1) its content and 
psychometric properties have been well validated [73], and 2), clinically meaningful changes 
in the FACT-P have been determined by validation comparisons with clinical measures of 
disease burden [74]. 
1.7 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group

There is no standard therapy for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with CRPC.   
Abiraterone  acetate  has  shown  significant  antitumor  activity  in  a  Phase  II  trial  in 
symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  chemo  naive  patients  with  CRPC.    Its  safety  profile  and 
tolerability  appears  reasonable  in  this  population when  given  in  combination  with 
prednisone.    Phase  2  studies were also  conducted  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
abiraterone acetate in CRPC patients receiving low dose prednisone [13,75].  Adverse events 
known  to  be  associated  with  abiraterone  acetate  monotherapy,  namely,  hypokalemia, 
hypertension, and fluid retention appear to be less frequent when abiraterone acetate is used 
in combination with low-dose prednisone.  The high degree of antitumor activity, as shown 
by PSA response, demonstrated by abiraterone in combination with prednisone in patients 
with CRPC together with a favorable toxicity profile supports the study of this regimen in a 
Phase III trial. 

Although  this  trial  is  blinded, randomized and  placebo  controlled for  abiraterone  acetate, 
patients  on  the  control  arm  will  receive  active  treatment  in  the  form  of  prednisone. 
Prednisone 5 mg bid has been selected for use in both study treatment groups.  Prednisone 
therapy of patients with CRPC is not simply a palliative intervention, but is associated with 
direct hormonal antitumor effects. 

The  current  EAU Guidelines  for  secondary  hormonal  therapy  of  patients  with  CRPC 
recommend treatment with adrenal testosterone inhibitors, low-dose DES, or glucocorticoids 
such as prednisone/prednisolone as standard approaches [27]. Therefore patients will receive 
either abiraterone acetate or placebo in a double-blinded manner, but also receive an active 
control in the form of prednisone rather than no treatment.

The  primary  hypothesis  of  this  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  is  that 
patients  receiving  abiraterone  acetate  and  prednisone  will  have improved overall  survival 
(OS) and/or radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) compared with patients receiving 
placebo  and  prednisone. 
  Radiographic  progression  requires  visceral  or  soft-tissue 
progression  on  CT  or  MRI  scans  using  modified  RECIST  criteria (Appendix  4),  or,  more 
commonly, appearance of new bone metastases on radionuclide scans [75].  Assessment of 
bone scan  worsening of individual lesions can  be problematic; this study will utilize bone 
scan standards for disease progression recommended by the PCWG2 criteria [75], and the 
rPFS endpoint will be based on independent radiologic review by blinded assessors.  This 
endpoint is more rigorous than the composite endpoints used in previous Phase III trials in 
CRPC  in  that  it  is  objective,  prospectively  defined,  and  capable  of  thorough  review  and 
confirmation by an independent referee.

In addition, secondary endpoints will allow a direct estimation of the clinical benefit of delay 
in radiographic progression.  Data on time to opiate administration for cancer pain, time to 
chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer, and time to deterioration in performance status 
will  be  collected  prospectively  using  clear  definitions  of  events.    This  should  allow  a 
comprehensible  clinical  context  for  improvements  in  time  to  radiographic  progression. 
Standard  secondary  endpoints  of  efficacy  in  CRPC  (time-to-PSA  progression  based  on 
PCWG2 criteria) will also be measured.
1.8 Radiographic PFS as an Efficacy Endpoint

Clinical  research  in  prostate  cancer  has  been  hindered  by  the  difficulty  in  objectively 
defining cancer progression.  Previous studies have used composite endpoints that included a 
mixture  of  patient  reported,  radiographic,  and  skeletal-related events.  These composite
endpoints attempted to address the complexity of clinical prostate cancer but suffered from 
subjectivity,  difficulties in  prospective  definition,  and  were  not  amenable  to  independent 
review.  Radiographic  PFS  as  defined  in  this  protocol is  not  a  composite  endpoint;  each 
measurement is objective and associated with clinical significance.  The issues from using 
RECIST  criteria  alone  to  define  radiographic  progression  in  prostate  cancer  are  well 
documented.  Fewer than 50% of men with CRPC have measurable lesions greater than 2cm 
in size, and most of these lesions are in lymph nodes which impact survival less than visceral 
metastases [4].  Conventional RECIST also lacks provisions to differentiate true progression 
of bone metastasis from the flare phenomenon on bone scan due to healing of previous bone 
metastasis [76,77].  Although radiographic PFS has not been established as a strong predictor 
for overall survival in a small study of patients receiving docetaxel therapy, it was found to 
outperform PSA based progression [77].

Previous  development  programs  (atrasentan  [29] and  docetaxel-treated  patients  [55]) have 
shown that two factors can limit the correlation of radiographic PFS with survival in CRPC. 
These will be mitigated in this study.   

 First,  analyses  of  PFS  have  highlighted  the  difficulty  in  determining  treatment 
effects  based  on  PFS  when  the  interval  between  assessments  (12  weeks)  was 
similar to the length of  PFS.  For this reason, the interval between  radiographic 
assessments is 8 weeks over the first 24 weeks of the study, then every 12 weeks 
thereafter.  

 Second,  because  early  progression  events  could  be  confounded  by  tumor  flare 
phenomenon,  in  this  study  new  consensus  guidelines  will  be  applied  to  define 
progression requiring confirmatory bone scans at least six weeks after the original 
scan.  This  will  reduce the  number  of  false  positive  determinations  of  CRPC 
progression.    rPFS  in  the  study  will  be  determined  by  an  independent  central 
reader blinded to PSA and other clinical data. 

Progression of metastatic bone disease is of paramount importance to CRPC patients since it 
is responsible for the severe morbidity of the skeletal related events such as fracture, pain, 
spinal  cord  compression,  pre-emptive  surgery  or  radiation  for  impeding  fracture  or  spinal 
cord  compression.  In  addition,  painful  bone  metastasis  often  requires  radiation,

Page 25 of 108

Abiraterone Acetate (CB7630)
Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302
December 17, 2013
chemotherapy or radionuclide therapy [78]. Similarly, progression of soft tissue metastasis 
may be associated with clinically significant morbidity.  Prevention of disease progression in 
pelvic  and  para-aortic  lymph  nodes  reduces  the  risk  for  urinary  outlet  tract  obstruction 
requiring invasive stent placement that is frequently complicated by infection. Development 
of liver metastasis could lead to organ failure and death.  Thus, delay in cancer progression 
should result in clear clinical benefit to the patient.  

In  conclusion, rPFS as  defined above is an objective and verifiable measurement likely to 
predict clinical benefit in the proposed study populations.
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary Objective(s)

To compare the clinical benefit of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus placebo plus 
prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naïve castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) 
who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)

The secondary objectives of this study are:

 To establish additional clinically relevant improvements in prostate cancer patients 

treated with abiraterone acetate in comparison to placebo 

 To characterize the safety profile of abiraterone acetate in this patient population
 To  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  of  abiraterone  acetate  when  administered 

concurrently with prednisone  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN

The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed the efficacy and safety data 
from the interim analysis of OS (43% of death events). The IDMC concluded that all of the 
data pointed to a significant advantage for patients in one arm of the study compared with the 
other  arm.  The  IDMC  unanimously  recommended  stopping  the  study,  unblinding,  and 
allowing crossover from the placebo arm to active therapy. A brief summary of the efficacy 
and  safety  data  is  provided  in  Appendix  11.  Patients  currently  receiving  placebo  will  be 
offered  crossover  therapy  to  abiraterone  acetate as  outlined  in  Appendix  11. Patients  who 
were on placebo and are now in long-term follow-up will also be offered abiraterone acetate 
as  outlined  in  Appendix  12. The  Schedule of  Events  for  patients  who  were  originally 
randomized to the abiraterone acetate treatment group will not change. Study COU-AA-302 
was  designed  to  perform  the  final  OS  analysis  after  approximately  773  death  events  had 
occurred. At the time of clinical cut off for the final analysis (CCO-FA) for OS, patients will 
be discontinued from long term follow-up. Patients still receiving abiraterone acetate at the 
time of this CCO-FA will be offered continued treatment for an additional period of up to 
3 years or until disease  progression or unacceptable toxicity (as outlined in Appendix 13). 
For these patients safety assessment, consisting of collection of Serious Adverse Events, as

continuing treatment, and for 30 days after the last dose of abiraterone acetate.
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan

This  is  a  Phase  3  multinational,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled 
study with a randomization allocation ratio of 1:1 (abiraterone acetate + prednisone: placebo
+  prednisone).    This  study  will  be  conducted  at  approximately  150 investigative  sites  and 
approximately 1000 patients will be enrolled.

3.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints

Overall survival  (OS)  and  radiographic  progression-free  survival (rPFS)  are  co-primary 
endpoints.

Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to date of death from any cause.  

Radiographic  progression-free  survival  is  based  on  parameters  suggested  by  PCWG2  [75] 
and  modified  RECIST  as  the  time  from  randomization  to  the  occurrence  of  one  of  the 
following:

1. A patient is considered to have progressed by bone scan if:

a. The first bone scan with ≥2 new lesions compared to baseline is observed <12 weeks 
from  randomization  and  is  confirmed  by  a  second  bone  scan  taken  ≥6  weeks  later 
showing ≥2 additional new lesions (a total of ≥4 new lesions compared to baseline); 

b. The first bone scan with ≥2 new lesions compared to baseline is observed ≥12 weeks 
from randomization and the new lesions are verified on the next bone scan ≥6 weeks 
later (a total of ≥2 new lesions compared to baseline).

2. Progression  of  soft  tissue  lesions  measured  by  CT  or  MRI  as  defined  in  modified 

RECIST criteria.

3. Death from any cause

3.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

The secondary endpoints for this study include: 

 Time to opiate use for cancer pain
 Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy
 Time to deterioration in ECOG performance score by ≥1 point

3.1.6 Study Duration and Dates

The study period will consist of screening, treatment, and follow-up phases.  In this study, 
patients  will  receive  study  treatment  (abiraterone acetate  or  placebo)  plus  prednisone  until 
radiographic  progression  of  disease and/or  unequivocal  clinical  progression  as  defined  in 
Section 6.6.  Follow-up will continue for 60 months (5 years) or until patient dies, is lost to 
follow-up, or withdraws informed consent.
3.2 Study Activities

3.2.1 Screening Period

All  patients  must  sign  a  written  informed  consent  form  before  study  specific  screening 
procedures are performed.  Screening procedures to evaluate patient eligibility for the study 
will be conducted within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  If the patient meets eligibility and 
screening  requirements  he  will  be  randomized  and  will  return  to  the  site  for  the  Cycle  1 
Day 1 visit and dosing.

Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302
3.2.2 Randomization

December 17, 2013

Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will be randomized to a treatment group according to 
the  randomization  schedule. All  patients  must  commence  treatment  within  72  hours 
(3 calendar days) of randomization.  

3.2.3 Treatment Period

Randomized  patients  will  have  Cycle  1  Day  1  procedures  and  receive  study  treatment 
(abiraterone  acetate  or  placebo)  that  will  subsequently  be  administered  orally  once  daily.  
Patients who participate in the pharmacokinetics testing will take their Day 1 dose of Cycles 
1, 2 and 5 in the clinic.  All patients will also take 5 mg of prednisone or prednisolone orally 
twice daily.  In regions where prednisone is not marketed or available, prednisolone will be 
provided. 
If  a  patient  has  been  receiving  glucocorticoids  other  than  prednisone  or 
prednisolone, it will be necessary to switch the glucocorticoid to prednisone or prednisolone 
5 mg bid prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

No crossover will be permitted between the 2 treatment groups.  Each cycle of treatment will 
be 28 days.  Patients will return for a Cycle 1 Day 15 visit ± 2 days to evaluate safety and 
dosing  adherence (a  count  of  study  drug tablets),  with  additional  safety  visits  at  Cycle  2 
Day 15  and  Cycle  3  Day  15. From  Cycle  2  to  End  of  Study Treatment,  Day 1  visits  will 
occur  every  28  days  with  a  ±  2  day  window.    Study  windows  are  to  be  calculated  from 
Cycle 1  Day  1  date,  and  if  utilized,  every  effort  will  be  made  for  the  patient  to  return  to 
schedule.  Patients may have additional imaging visits up to 8 days before Cycles requiring 
images (Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, Cycle 7 Day 1, Cycle 10 Day 1 and every 3rd cycle 
beyond Cycle 10) or at Treatment Discontinuation Visit.

3.2.4 Follow-up Period

During  the  Follow-up  Period,  overall  survival,  opiate  use,  ECOG  performance  status,  and 
next  therapy  for  prostate  cancer should  be  assessed every  3  months  for  up  to  60  months 
(5 years) and may be collected by telephone interview or chart review.

During  the  Follow-up  Period,  deaths  regardless  of  causality  and  serious  adverse  events 
thought to be related to study treatment (abiraterone acetate or placebo) will be collected and 
reported within 24 hours of discovery or notification of the event.  

See Appendix 1, Schedule of Events.

5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient

December 17, 2013

Each  treatment  cycle  consists  of  28  consecutive  days.    Patients  may  take  study  treatment
(abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or placebo plus prednisone) until radiographic disease 
progression and/or unequivocal clinical progression (as defined in Section 6.6), at which time
study  treatment will  be  discontinued. If  the  patient  had  radiographic  progression  but  no 
unequivocal  clinical  progression,  and  alternate  treatment  is  not  initiated,  the  patient  may 
continue  on  study  treatment  at  the  Investigator’s  discretion  (see  Section  6.6).  The  dose  of 
prednisone  will  be  gradually  reduced  if clinically  indicated. It  is  not  required  for  the 
prednisone to be taken at the same time as study treatment (abiraterone acetate or placebo).  
The  dose  of  prednisone  will  remain  unchanged  in  the  event  that  the  study  drug dose  is 
changed.  If a prednisone dose is missed, it should be omitted and will not be made up.  
5.4 Randomization Procedures

Patients will be randomized after the investigator has verified that all eligibility criteria have 
been  met.    Patients  will  be  randomized  to  receive  abiraterone  acetate  plus  prednisone  or 
placebo plus prednisone in a 1:1 ratio.  

Randomization  will  take  place  across  all  study  sites  using  a  centralized  Interactive 
Web/Voice Response System (IWRS/IVRS).  At randomization, the IWRS/IVRS will assign 
a unique patient identification number to each patient.  The patient’s identification number 
will be used on all study-related documents including case report forms (CRFs).  A treatment 
number will also be assigned to each patient.  This treatment number is the link between a 
patient’s CRF and blinded treatment group assignment.  Patient identification numbers will 
not be reused.  Patients withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.

All patients must commence treatment within 72 hours (3 calendar days) of randomization.  
5.5 Stratification

In  this  study, patients  will  be  stratified  according  to  baseline  ECOG  performance  status 
(0 versus 1).  Patients withdrawn/discontinued from the study will not be replaced.
5.6 Blinding

This  is  a  randomized,  double-blind  study.    Patients  will  receive  abiraterone acetate  plus
prednisone or placebo plus prednisone.  At the time of disease progression, patient treatment 
assignments will remain blinded.  The following precautions are to be taken to ensure that 
blinding is adequately maintained throughout the study.

5.6.1 Randomization Codes

The  treatment  to  which  a  patient  is  assigned  will  be  determined  by  IWRS/IVRS
(Section  5.4). A  randomization  schedule  will  be  generated  and  maintained  within  the 
IWRS/IVRS.  All study personnel will be blinded to the patient treatment assignments.

5.6.2 Laboratory Tests Results

December 17, 2013

In order to maintain the blind, the Central Laboratory will not send PK and TMPRSS2-ERG
results  to  the  sites  and  will  not  transfer  results  to  the  clinical  database  until the blind  is 
broken. Investigators  must  not  obtain  local  laboratory  serum testosterone  after  Cycle  1 
Day 1, as this measurement may unblind the patient.  Similarly, investigators must not obtain 
post-baseline  circulating  tumor  cell  measurements,  as  these  may  bias  the  investigator’s 
decision-making on the study.

5.6.3 Accidental Unblinding

If a patient’s treatment assignment is accidentally unblinded, that patient should remain in the 
study  and  continue  treatment  with  the  assigned  treatment  and  all  protocol  tests  and 
assessments. Unblinding information will be captured in the CRF.  
5.7 Concomitant Therapy

The  use  of  any  concurrent  medication  from  screening  and  while  on  study,  prescription  or 
over-the-counter, is to be recorded on the patient's CRF along with the reason the medication
was taken.  In addition, tobacco and alcohol use will be collected. 

Concurrent enrollment in another clinical investigational drug or device study is prohibited.

Supportive care medications are permitted with their use following institutional guidelines. 
For patients who did not undergo orchiectomy, concurrent treatment with LHRH analogue is 
mandatory and must be recorded.

The following supportive care medications are considered permissible during the study:

 Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists to maintain testosterone 

<50ng/dL (< 2.0 nM)

 Conventional multivitamins, selenium and soy supplements 
 Additional  systemic  glucocorticoid  administration  such  as  “stress  dose” 
glucocorticoid  is  permitted  if clinically  indicated for  a  life  threatening  medical
condition, and in such cases, the use of steroids will be documented as concomitant 
drug

 Bisphosphonate usage  is  allowed  only  if  patients  are  on  the  medication  prior  to 

Study Day 1

 Transfusions and hematopoietic growth factors per institutional practice guidelines
If  the  permissibility  of  a  specific  drug/treatment  is  in  question,  please  contact  the  study 
sponsor.

5.8 Prohibited Concomitant Medication Restrictions

December 17, 2013

The  concurrent  administration  of  other  anticancer  therapy,  including  cytotoxic,  hormonal 
(except LHRH agonists), or immunotherapy is prohibited during study treatment phase.  Use 
of other investigational drug therapy for any reason is prohibited. Bisphosphonate usage is 
allowed only if patients are on the medication prior to randomization.  New bisphosphonate 
therapy cannot be initiated after randomization.

Concomitant therapy during the treatment phase of the study with any of the following listed 
is prohibited:

5 α-reductase inhibitor


 Chemotherapy
Immunotherapy

 Bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide
 Systemic ketoconazole (or other azole drugs such as fluconazole and itraconazole)
 Diethylstilbestrol, PC-SPES, and other preparations such as saw palmetto thought 

to have endocrine effects on prostate cancer

 Radiopharmaceuticals such as strontium (89Sr) or samarium (153Sm)
 Aldactone, Spironol (spironolactone)
 Digoxin, digitoxin, and other digitalis drugs
 Cyproterone acetate
 Fludrocortisone acetate (Florinef)

5.8.1 Special Concomitant Therapy

CYP3A4  inducers:  In  a  clinical  pharmacokinetic  interaction  study  of  healthy  subjects 
pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin, 600 mg daily for 6 days) followed by a 
single dose of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, the mean plasma area under the curve (AUC)∞
of  abiraterone  was  decreased  by  55%.  Strong  inducers  of  CYP3A4  (eg,  phenytoin, 
carbamazepine,  rifampicin,  rifabutin,  rifapentine,  phenobarbital)  during  treatment  with 
abiraterone acetate are to be avoided, or used with careful evaluation of clinical efficacy.
5.9 Potential for Drug-Drug Interactions

Investigators  should  keep  in  mind  the  possibility  that  abiraterone  may  interact  with 
concomitant medications, particularly those that are metabolized or activated by P450 CYPs 
2D6 and 1A2 (see Table 1).  Please refer to the current IB for a listing of drugs metabolized 
by  P450  CYPs inhibited  by  abiraterone  or  abiraterone acetate and  for  other  additional 
information.
If  at  any  time  an  investigator  suspects  a  drug-drug  interaction  due  to 
abiraterone  acetate  therapy,  an  adverse  event  report  should be  completed  and  the  sponsor 
should be notified.

5.12.2 Storage Requirements For The Patient

Bottles of blinded study treatment should be stored at room temperature [15º-30ºC; 59º-86ºF] 
in  the  original  container/closure  with  the  cap  on  tightly and  should  not  be  refrigerated. 
Patients  should  be  advised  to  keep  all  medications  out  of  the  reach  and  out  of  sight  of
children.
5.13 Investigational Product Retention and Accountability at Study Site

At the time of delivery of study treatment to the site, the investigator, designee, or Pharmacist 
(where appropriate) will sign a drug receipt form to confirm that the supplies for the study 
have been received.  This form will specify supply, lot numbers, quantities shipped/delivered, 
and  date  of  receipt.  The  form  will  also  contain  statements  confirming  that  the  study 
treatment has been received in good condition.

Study treatment must  be  stored  in  a  secure  location  between  15º-30ºC; 59º-86ºF.  
Accountability  for  study  treatment  is  the  responsibility  of  the  investigator.    More  details 
concerning this responsibility are included in Appendix 2.

Study treatment must only be dispensed by a pharmacist or medically qualified staff.  Study 
treatment is to be dispensed only to patients enrolled in this study.  Once the study treatment
is prepared for a patient, it can only be administered to that patient.

The  study  site  must  maintain  accurate  records  demonstrating  dates  and  amount  of  study 
treatment (abiraterone acetate, placebo, prednisone) received, to whom dispensed (patient by 
patient  accounting),  and  accounts  of  any  study  treatment  accidentally  or  deliberately 
destroyed.  At the end of the study, reconciliation must be made between the amount of study 
treatment supplied, dispensed, and subsequently destroyed or returned to the sponsor or its 
representative.

Study site staff should refer to Appendix 2, information located in the Pharmacy Manual, and 
the  Investigator’s  Brochure for  specific  instructions  on  the  handling,  storage, and 
administration of the study treatment.

All study treatment will be returned to the sponsor or its representative or destroyed at the 
site as specified in writing by the sponsor.

6 STUDY PROCEDURES
6.1 Informed Consent

December 17, 2013

A  signed,  Institutional  Review  Board/Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IRB/IEC)  approved, 
written  informed  consent  form  must  be  obtained  from  patients  before  any  study  specific 
procedures or randomization can occur.  Confirmation of the patient’s informed consent and 
the informed consent process must also be documented in the patient’s medical record.

A copy of the signed informed consent form will be given to the patient.
6.2 Medical History

Medical  history,  such  as  previous  treatments,  procedures,  and  conditions  will  be  collected 
during the screening period.
6.3 Physical Examination

Evaluations  should  be  performed  by  the  same  evaluator  throughout  the  study  whenever 
possible.  If it is not possible to use the same evaluator to follow the patient, then evaluations 
should overlap (i.e., examine the patient together and discuss findings) for at least one visit.

Physical  examination  includes HEENT (head,  eyes,  ears,  nose,  and  throat),  chest,  cardiac, 
abdominal, extremities, neurologic, and lymph node examinations. Weight will be recorded 
at every visit.  Height will be recorded at screening visit only. 

Vital signs include upright blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral or aural body 
temperature.

6.4.2 Pharmacokinetics (PK) Assessments and Additional ECG Monitoring

December 17, 2013

Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained from approximately 150-200 patients at selected 
study  centers.    A  total  of  6 blood  samples  will  be  drawn (2 samples  during Cycle  1;  2 
samples  during Cycle  2,  and  2  samples  during Cycle  5).  These  data  will  be  used  for  an 
integrated population pharmacokinetic analysis. In addition, 12-lead ECG assessment will be 
done pre-dose (at the Screening Visit) and at approximately two hours post-dose (at Cycles 1, 
2,  and  5).  Samples  will  be  assayed  for  both  abiraterone  acetate  and  its  major  metabolite, 
abiraterone.

6.4.3 TMPRSS2-ERG and other biomarkers

Variation in response to treatment in advanced prostate cancer studies may be attributable in 
part to disease heterogeneity and differences in hormone sensitivity [79].  Molecular studies 
within this trial will seek to define subjects with tumor subtypes that may respond better to 
therapy  with  abiraterone  acetate.  The  results  of  these  studies  will  be  used  to  identify 
response  classifiers  and  inform  the  design  of  other  clinical  trials  involving abiraterone 
acetate. 

Previously  archived  paraffin-embedded,  formalin-fixed  tumor  tissue  from  the  time  of  the 
subject’s  initial  tumor  diagnosis  or  from  a  subsequent  procedure  conducted  as  part  of  the 
subject’s  standard  care  but  before  abiraterone  acetate  drug  treatment  will  be  utilized. 
Subjects  who  do  not  have  tumor  blocks  or  unstained  slides  may  have  blood  drawn  for 
collection of circulating tumor cells (CTC’s).  FISH using an ERG break-apart assay will be 
performed to determine TMPRSS2 status and global micro-RNA profiling will be conducted 
using qPRC profiling technology. 

Purified DNA and RNA from these samples may also be examined to detect abnormalities 
(mutations, deletions, amplifications) in selected genes by utilizing various technologies (e.g. 
qRT-PCR, DASL, microarray profiling).  Genes implicated in prostate cancer progression or 
prognosis or genes thought to be related to the mechanism of action of abiraterone acetate 
may be examined if sufficient sample remains. 

Biomarker Samples
Biomarker sample collections will be applicable only for sites in countries where the health 
authorities have approved of this testing and where IRB/EC approval has also been obtained. 
Instructions on sample handling, labeling, and shipment are given in the laboratory manual. 

Withdrawal From Biomarker Testing
If  a  subject  withdraws  consent  for  the  additional  biomarker  testing,  any  DNA  or  RNA 
extracted  from  the  subject’s  sample  will  be  destroyed.  The  investigator  must  notify  the 
sponsor site contact, who will request sample destruction using the withdrawal of consent for 
biomarker testing form.  The investigator will receive written confirmation from the sponsor 
that the samples have been destroyed.

6.4.4 Sample Collection, Storage, and Shipping

December 17, 2013

A Central Laboratory will analyze all hematology, blood chemistry, tissue and urine samples 
collected  for  the  study.  Samples  will  be  analyzed  at  a  facility  meeting  regulatory 
requirements and/or using methods documented in a methods validation report.  All shipping 
requirements and storage conditions will be provided in a protocol-specific lab manual. 
6.5
SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING

All  observed  or  volunteered  adverse  events  regardless  of  treatment  group  or  causal 
relationship to study drug will be recorded on the adverse event page(s) of the case report 
form (CRF).

6.5.1 Definitions

6.5.1.1 Adverse Events

An  adverse  event  is  defined  in  the  International  Conference  on  Harmonisation  (ICH) 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice as  “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical  investigation  subject  administered  a  pharmaceutical  product  and  that  does  not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.” (ICH E6:1.2)

This definition of adverse events is broadened in this study to include any such occurrence 
(e.g., sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition from the 
time that a subject has signed informed consent to the time of randomization or initiation of 
investigational  drug.  Worsening  indicates  that  the  pre-existing  medical  condition  (e.g., 
diabetes, migraine headaches, gout, hypertension, etc.) has increased in severity, frequency, 
or duration of the condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes.

For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to both 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification  as  a  serious  adverse  event  (see  Section  6.5.1.2)  requiring  immediate 
notification to the sponsor or its designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient 
information should be obtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the adverse 
event.    The  investigator  is  required  to  assess  causality.    For  adverse  events  with  a  causal 
relationship to the investigational product, follow-up by the investigator is required until the 
event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator and the sponsor clinical 
monitor or his/her designated representative.

Interventions  for pretreatment  conditions  (e.g.,  elective  cosmetic  surgery)  or  medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered adverse events.  

6.5.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that:

 Results in death;


Is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death);

Confidential

Page 41 of 108

Abiraterone Acetate (CB7630)
Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302

December 17, 2013

 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;


Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Important  medical  events  that  may  not  result  in  death,  be  life  threatening,  or  require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one  of  the  outcomes  listed  in  this  definition.  Examples  of  such  medical  events  include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.

A hospitalization meeting the definition for “serious” is any inpatient hospital admission that 
includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility.  

Inpatient  admission  does  not  include:  rehabilitation  facilities,  hospice  facilities,  skilled 
nursing facilities, nursing homes, routine emergency room  admissions, same day surgeries 
(as  outpatient/same  day/ambulatory  procedures),  or  social  admission  (e.g.,  subject  has  no 
place to sleep).

6.5.1.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARS)

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARS) are events which are serious as 
per the above criteria, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable 
product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure) and are judged by the investigator or the 
sponsor to be unlikely, possibly, or related to study treatment.

6.5.2

Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events

The  investigator  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  adverse  events  (as  defined  in 
Section 6.5.1 and  as  further  specified  below)  observed  by  the  investigator  or  reported  by 
subjects  are  collected  and  recorded  in  the  subjects’  medical  records,  in  the  CRF,  and,  for 
serious  adverse  events,  on  the  serious  adverse  event  report  (SAER)  form.    These  adverse 
events will include the following:

 All  serious  adverse  events  (as  defined  in  Section  6.5.1.2)  that  occur  after  the 
subject has signed the informed consent form and up to 30 days after the last dose 
will be documented.

 All  non-serious  adverse  events  (as  defined  in  Section  6.5.1)  that  occur  after 
randomization  to  study  treatment  up  to  30  days  after  the  last  dose  will  be 
documented.

The following adverse event attributes must be assigned by the investigator: adverse event 
diagnosis  or  syndrome(s)  (if  known,  signs  or  symptoms  if  not  known);  event  description 
(with detail appropriate to the event); dates of onset and resolution; severity; assessment of 
relatedness  to  study  treatment  (abiraterone  acetate  or  placebo);  and  action  taken.    The 

Confidential

Page 42 of 108

Abiraterone Acetate (CB7630)
Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302
December 17, 2013
investigator  may  be  asked  to  provide  follow-up  information,  discharge  summaries,  and 
extracts from medical records or CRFs.

For  all  adverse  events, sufficient  information  should  be  obtained  by  the  investigator  to 
determine  the  causality  of  the  adverse  event  (e.g. study  drug  or  other  illness). The 
relationship of the adverse event to the study treatment (abiraterone acetate or placebo) will 
be assessed following the definitions below: 

 Unrelated: any event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration  of  study  drug  AND that  is  likely  to  have  been  produced  by  the 
patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.

 Unlikely: any  event  that  does  not  follow  a  reasonable  temporal  sequence  from 
administration  of  study  drug  OR that  is  likely  to  have  been  produced  by  the 
patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.

 Possibly: any  reaction  that  follows  a  reasonable  temporal  sequence  from 
administration  of  study  drug  OR that  follows  a  known  response  pattern  to  the 
suspected  drug  AND that  could  not  be  reasonably  explained  by  the  known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered 
to the patient.

 Related: any  reaction  that  follows  a  reasonable  temporal  sequence  from 
administration  of  study  drug  AND that  follows  a  known  response  pattern  to  the 
suspected  drug  AND that  recurs  with  re-challenge,  AND/OR is  improved  by 
stopping the drug or reducing the dose.

6.5.3

Severity of Adverse Events

Adverse event severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE and SAEs.  The 
severity assessment for an AE/SAE should be completed using the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 3.0, Appendix 5).  

Any AE/SAE not listed in the CTCAE version 3.0 will be graded as follows:

SEVERITY OF EVENT
Grade Definition
1
2
3
4
5

Mild: Symptoms which do not interfere with patient’s daily activities
Moderate: Symptoms which may interfere with patient’s daily activities
Severe: Events which interrupt patient’s usual daily activities 
Life-threatening or disabling.
Death 

Medically significant adverse events considered related to the study treatment (abiraterone 
acetate  or  placebo)  by  the  investigator  or  the  sponsor  will  be  followed  until  resolved  or 
considered stable.

Confidential

Abiraterone Acetate (CB7630)
Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302
December 17, 2013
It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse event is 
related and of sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment or from the 
study.    A  subject  may  also  voluntarily  withdraw  from  treatment  due  to  what  he  or she 
perceives  as  an  intolerable  adverse  event.    If  either  of  these  situations  arises,  the  subject 
should  be  strongly  encouraged  to  undergo  an  End  of  Study  Treatment  assessment  and  be 
under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.

6.5.4

Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures

Serious adverse events will be collected and recorded at least throughout the study period, 
beginning  with  the  signing  of  the  informed  consent  through  30  days  after  the  end  of  the 
treatment phase.  

All serious adverse events that occur after the subject has signed the informed consent form 
or during the study must be reported within 24 hours of discovery or notification of the event 
to a sponsor representative or study personnel through the planned adverse event reporting 
process and recorded on the appropriate case report form (CRF). 

Relevant  medical  records  should  be  provided  to  the  sponsor as  soon  as  they  become 
available; autopsy reports should be provided for deaths if available.  

Related serious adverse events are events that are judged by the investigator or the sponsor
to be unlikely, possibly, or related to study treatment (abiraterone acetate or placebo).  See 
definitions above.

Determination of expectedness will be based on the contents of the Investigator’s Brochure. 

If the event is serious, unexpected, and related then it will be deemed to be a SUSAR and 
will be reported as a blinded SUSAR in order to maintain the blind and protect the integrity 
of the clinical investigation.

Since a fatal outcome (death) is the primary efficacy endpoint for this study, deaths events 
will remain blinded in order to protect the integrity of the clinical investigation.

SUSARs will be reported as required by relevant authorities.

If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study because of a serious adverse event, this 
information must be included in the initial or follow-up Serious Adverse Event Report Form 
as well as the End of Study Treatment Case Report Form.

The  investigator  should  notify  the  appropriate IRB  or  ethics  committee  (EC)  of  serious 
adverse  events  occurring  at  the  site  and  other  adverse  event  reports  received  from  the 
sponsor, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.

6.5.5 Long-Term Follow-Up

December 17, 2013

For  the  long-term  follow-up  (e.g.,  to  collect  outcomes),  serious  adverse  events  considered 
related to investigational drug will be collected and reported on the Serious Adverse Event 
Report form to the sponsor within 24 hours of discovery or notification of the event.  

6.5.6 Abnormal Laboratory Results

All clinically important abnormal laboratory tests occurring during the study will be repeated 
at appropriate intervals until they return either to baseline or to a level deemed acceptable by 
the  investigator  and  the  sponsor medical  monitor  (or  his/her  designated  representative),  or 
until  a  diagnosis  that  explains  them  is  made.    The  criteria  for  determining  whether  an 
abnormal laboratory test result should be reported as an adverse event are as follows:

1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention (merely 
repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not meet 
criteria for reporting and an AE), and/or

3. Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant 

additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or

4. Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a serious adverse 

event, and/or

5. Test result is considered to be an adverse event by the investigator or sponsor
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
adverse  event,  even  if  it  did  meet  one  of  the  above  conditions  except  for  condition  #4. 
Clinically significant laboratory results must be recorded in the patient’s CRF.

6.5.7

Management of Study Drug-Related Events 

Based  upon  experience  from  Phase  1  and  ongoing  Phase  2  studies,  abiraterone  acetate  is 
generally  well  tolerated.    The  most  common  adverse  events  related  to  abiraterone  acetate 
monotherapy include fatigue due to reduced cortisol level as a result of CYP17 inhibition; 
and hypertension, fluid retention, and hypokalemia due to mineralocorticoid excess caused 
by compensatory ACTH drive.  In this study, the concomitant administration of prednisone is 
expected  to  mitigate  these  side  effects  by  supplementing  cortisol  and  abrogating  ACTH 
drive.  

It has been documented that following prolonged therapy with corticosteroids, patients may 
develop Cushings syndrome characterized by central adiposity, thin skin, easy bruising, and 
proximal myopathy.  Withdrawal of the corticosteroid may result in symptoms that include 
fever, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, and malaise.  This may occur even without evidence of 
adrenal insufficiency.

For  guidance on management of side effects of glucocorticoid usage, symptoms related to 
castration  (androgen  deprivation),  severe  and  refractory  headaches,  fatigue,  or  other 
toxicities, please contact the Medical Monitor.  

Re-initiation of study treatment after resolution of adverse events must be discussed with and 
approved by the Protocol Medical Monitor.

6.5.7.1 Management of Hypokalemia 

At  the  initial  observation  of  Grade  1  hypokalemia  (serum  potassium  <  3.5  mM  or  below 
lower limit of normal range, but ≥ 3.0 mM), oral potassium supplement will be initiated. The 
dose  of  potassium  supplement  must  be  carefully  titrated  to  maintain  serum  potassium  at 
≥ 3.5 mM  but  ≤  5.0  mM. Any  patient  with  low  potassium  while  on  study  or  a  history  of 
hypokalemia  from  a  pre-existing  or  concurrent  medical  condition  will  undergo  weekly  or 
more  frequent  laboratory  electrolyte  evaluation. 
The  investigator  should  consider 
maintaining the patient’s potassium level at ≥ 4.0 mM in these patients.

If  any  patient  experiences  Grade  3 hypokalemia  (serum  potassium levels  <  3.0  mM  –
2.5 mM, NCI CTCAE v3.0) or life-threatening hypokalemia with potassium levels < 2.5 mM 
(NCI CTCAE v3.0 hypokalemia Grade 4), study treatment will be withheld, and the patient 
hospitalized for intravenous potassium replacement and cardiac monitoring. Re-initiation of 
study treatment after normalization of potassium levels must be discussed with and approved 
by the Medical Monitor.

6.6 Criteria for Discontinuation of Study Treatment

December 17, 2013

The co-primary efficacy endpoint is rPFS, as defined in Sections 3.1.1 and 9.7. Confirmed 
radiographic progression may be a reliable indicator of clinical benefit in patients with CRPC
[75].  Patients  should  ordinarily  be  maintained  on  study  treatment  until  confirmed 
radiographic  progression.  If  the  patient  has  radiographic  progression  but  no  unequivocal 
clinical progression and alternate treatment is not initiated, the patient may continue on study 
treatment, at the investigator’s discretion

However, if patients have unequivocal clinical progression without radiographic progression,
these  patients  are indicated  for  the  current  standard  of  care.  Study  treatment  should  be 
stopped and patients advised regarding available treatment options. 

For this study, unequivocal clinical progression will be characterized as:

1) Cancer pain requiring initiation of chronic administration of opiate analgesia (oral opiate 

use for ≥3 weeks; parenteral opiate use for ≥7 days, as listed in Appendix 10).
Patients with cancer pain requiring opiate analgesia for relief should also be assessed by
the investigator for the need for initiating systemic chemotherapy.

Or
2)

Immediate need to initiate cytotoxic chemotherapy or the immediate need to have either 
radiation therapy or surgical intervention for complications due to tumor progression, 
even in the absence of radiographic evidence of disease progression.

Or
3) Deterioration in ECOG performance status to grade 3 or higher. 

Patients whose ECOG performance status decreases to grade 2 during the study should 
be assessed carefully for their need for docetaxel therapy.

When  study  treatment  is  discontinued  due  to  unequivocal  clinical  progression,  the 
investigator should obtain imaging studies at the Treatment Discontinuation Visit to assess 
for radiographic progression, including a confirmatory bone scan, as appropriate. 

Study treatment will be continued on patients who have increasing PSA values in the absence 
of radiographic or unequivocal clinical progression.  Although serial PSA’s will be measured 
on this study, progression or change in PSA values is not considered a reliable measure of 
disease progression, and should not be used as an indication to discontinue study therapy.
6.7 Withdrawal from Study Treatment Phase

A patient may withdraw from study treatment phase for any reason.



In this event, the reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented and clarification 
requested whether withdrawal of consent applies only to the Treatment Phase (i.e.
patient  has  not  withdrawn  consent  for  data  collection  during  the  post-treatment 
Follow-Up  Phase) or  to  both  the  Treatment  and  Follow-Up  Phases.  A  patient’s

decision to take part in the study is voluntary, and he may choose not to take part 
in the study or to stop taking part at anytime.  If he chooses not to take part or to 
stop at anytime, it will not affect his future medical care or medical benefits.

An investigator may withdraw a patient from the study Treatment Phase at any time based on 
clinical judgment or for any of the following reasons listed below.  When possible all End of 
Study Treatment  procedures  should  be  conducted  and  the  patient  should  be  followed  for 
survival as specified in Section 7.3.



 Discontinuation of treatment criteria as defined in Section 6.6.
 Sustained Side Effects: Patients who have sustained toxicities that do not return to 
NCI CTCAE (version 3.0) Grade 1 or less with appropriate medical management, 
should be discontinued from the study treatment.  
Initiation of new anticancer treatment: Patients will be discontinued from the study
treatment  when  investigator  determines  new  treatment  for  prostate  cancer  is 
warranted.  For  patients  who  did  not  undergo  orchiectomy,  concurrent  treatment 
with  LHRH  analogue  is  mandatory  and  must  be  recorded.    The  concurrent 
administration of other anticancer therapy, including cytotoxic, hormonal (except 
LHRH  agonists),  or  immunotherapy  is  prohibited  during  study  treatment  Phase.  
Use of other investigational drug therapy for any reason is prohibited.

7.2.7 Unscheduled Visits

If an imaging procedure is performed at an unscheduled visit, and progression is observed by 
bone scan, a confirmatory bone scan should be obtained at least 6 weeks later. 
7.3 Post-Treatment Follow-up Period (Survival or Long-Term 

Follow-Up)

Once  a  patient  has  completed  the  treatment  period,  overall  survival  follow-up  will be 
performed  every  3  months  for  up  to  60  months  (5 years).    In  addition  to  overall  survival, 
opiate use, ECOG performance status, and next therapy for prostate cancer (including dose 
and treatment duration of cytotoxic chemotherapy) will also be collected.  Follow up may be 
performed by  telephone  interview  or  chart  review and  will  be  reported  on  the  case  report 
form.

During  the  Follow-up  Period,  deaths  regardless  of  causality  and  serious  adverse  events 
thought to be related to study treatment (abiraterone acetate or placebo) will be collected and 
reported within 24 hours of discovery or notification of the event. 
8 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE

The sponsor’s representatives are responsible for contacting and visiting the investigator for 
the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of 
the clinical study (e.g., CRFs and other pertinent data) provided that patient confidentiality is 
respected.

The investigator agrees  to cooperate with the monitor to ensure resolution of all problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs.

During and after completion of the study, quality assurance auditor (s) named by the sponsor
or the regulatory authorities may perform on-site audits/inspections.  The investigators will 
be  expected  to  cooperate  with  any  audit/inspection and  to  provide  assistance  and 
documentation  (including  source  data)  as  requested.  The  investigator  will  immediately

Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302
December 17, 2013
inform the sponsor’s Quality Assurance if contacted by a regulatory authority regarding an 
on-site audit/inspection of this study.

In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, investigators may be selected for 
audit  by  representatives  from  the  sponsor’s Quality  Assurance  Department  (or  designees).  
Inspection of site facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories) and review of 
study-related  records  will  occur  to  evaluate  the  study  conduct  and  compliance  with 
applicable  regulatory  requirements  (e.g.,  US  IND  regulations  (21CFR312),  EU  Clinical 
Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC), the protocol and ICH Good Clinical Practice (ICH 
E6).
9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 General Considerations

All  statistical  analyses  will  be  performed  using  SAS®.  The  resulting  statistic  will  be 
evaluated  using  East® given  the  precise  number  of  events  observed  at  the  time  of  interim 
analysis. 

Unless otherwise specified, all continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics, which will include the number of patients (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum.  All categorical endpoints will be summarized using frequencies 
and percentages.  The baseline measurement will be the last value on or before the date of 
first study treatment.
9.2 Determination of Sample Size

9.2.1 Sample Size Determination 

The overall level of significance for the study will be 0.05. However, 0.04 will be used in the 
testing of OS, and 0.01 will be used in the testing of rPFS.  The exact timing of the analysis 
will  be  carried  out  according  to  the  pre-specified  required  number  of  events  for  each 
endpoint. 

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive abiraterone acetate or placebo.

Recent publications suggest that a similar patient population has an estimated median OS of 
approximately  20  to  22  months. A  median  of  22  months  is  assumed  in  the  sample  size 
calculation  accounting  for  differences  in  patient  populations  in  comparing  these  study 
designs.  These  publications  also  suggest  the  estimated  median  rPFS  of  approximately 
4 months for these patients.

9.2.1.1 Hypothesized OS Hazard Ratio of 0.80

It was assumed that the hazards for the two treatment groups follow a proportional hazards 
model for OS.  The test to detect a difference between a median  OS of 22 months in the 
placebo group and a median OS of 27.5 months in the abiraterone acetate group (HR=0.80) 
at  the  2-tailed  significance  level  of  0.04  with  a  power  of  85%  would  require  773 events. 

Confidential

Abiraterone Acetate (CB7630)
Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302
December 17, 2013
Assuming an enrollment rate of 50 patients per month over 20 months, a total sample size of 
approximately  1000  patients  is  planned  for  the  study.  The  OS  endpoint  will  incorporate 
group  sequential  design  by  including  3  interim  analyses  and  one  final  analysis  using  the 
O’Brien-Fleming boundaries as implemented by Lan-DeMets alpha spending method.  This 
method ensures that the type I error rate is not inflated.  The interim analyses are planned at 
15% (estimated), 40%,  and 55% of the required number of events.  The cumulative alpha 
spent will be <0.0001, 0.0005, 0.0034, and 0.040 for each of the 4 analyses respectively.  The 
exact  timing  of  the  first  interim  analysis  will  be  determined  according  to  the  rPFS  events 
required.

9.2.1.2 Hypothesized rPFS Hazard Ratio of 0.667

Only one analysis  will be  conducted  for  rPFS.  Assuming that the  hazards  for the  two 
treatment  groups  follow a proportional hazard  model, it is estimated that 378 rPFS  events 
would be required to provide a 91% power in detecting a median rPFS of 4 months for the 
placebo group versus 6 months for the abiraterone group (HR=0.667) at a 2-tailed level of 
significance of 0.01; the same enrollment assumptions as described for OS is assumed. It is 
anticipated that at the time of observing the required rPFS events, approximately 680 patients 
will have been enrolled.  At the conclusion of the rPFS analysis, including data review by the 
data monitoring committee, it is expected that nearly 1000 patients will have been enrolled.
9.3 Interim and Final Analyses

Interim analysis for rPFS is not planned. The analysis of rPFS will be carried out at the two-
tailed 0.01 level of significance.  The first interim analysis for OS will be timed according to 
the required number of events for rPFS.  The alpha spent for OS will be adjusted accordingly 
using the alpha spending method as indicated above for all the analyses which should protect 
from inflating the type I error rate.
9.4 Analysis Populations 

Patient disposition and efficacy analyses will be performed on data from the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population.  All patients randomized into the study will be classified according to their 
assigned treatment group, regardless of the actual treatment received.  The primary efficacy 
analyses will be on the ITT basis.

All  patients  who  receive  any  part  of  study  drug  will  be  included  in  the  analysis  of  safety 
(Safety Population).
9.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

Demographic variables will include age, race, ethnicity, height, and weight.  Baseline disease 
characteristics  will include  time  from  diagnosis,  number  of  prior  hormonal  therapies,  and 
other clinical characteristics as documented in the CRF.

9.6 Study Endpoint(s)

9.6.1 Efficacy Endpoint(s)

Co-Primary efficacy endpoints:

 Overall survival 
 Radiographic progression-free survival

Secondary efficacy endpoints: 

 Time to opiate use for cancer pain
 Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy
 Time to deterioration in ECOG performance score by ≥1 points
 Time-to-PSA progression based on PCWG2 criteria 

Other endpoints :

 PSA  response  rate [Proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  PSA  decline  ≥  50% 

according to Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) criteria]

 Objective response rate in patients with measurable disease (RECIST)
 Duration of response in patients with measurable disease
 QoL total score and each subscale score as assessed by FACT-P
 Time to pain progression
 Time to analgesic progression

9.7 Efficacy Analysis Population and Methods

All randomized patients will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population who will be 
classified  according  to  their  assigned  treatment  group,  regardless  of  the  actual  treatment 
received.

Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to date of death from any cause.  

Radiographic  progression-free  survival  is  defined as  the  time  from  randomization  to  the 
occurrence  of  radiographic  progression  (Section  3.1.1)  or  death.  The  analysis  of  rPFS 
endpoint will use the centrally reviewed radiographic assessment of progression.

The overall 5% level of significance will be used to compare the treatment effect with respect 
to both OS and rPFS endpoints.  The OS and rPFS endpoints will be tested using 0.04 and 
0.01 level of significance, respectively. The analyses of the primary endpoints for OS and 
rPFS are event driven according to the required number of events for each endpoint. If the 
rPFS endpoint is significant, the results will be summarized for regulatory review, along with 
the secondary endpoints. If the OS analysis is not significant, the study will continue and the 
patients will be followed for survival until the required number of events is observed.

Distributions of time-to-event variables will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-
limit method.  The median times to event with two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
estimated.    The  stratified  logrank  test  will  be  used  as  the  primary  analysis  for  treatment 
comparison.  The estimate of the hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals will also 
be provided.

Response rate will be the proportion of patients fulfilling the respective criteria for response.  
The  relative  risk  (treatment:  control)  will  be  reported  along  with  the  associated  95% 
confidence  interval.  Statistical  inference  will  be  evaluated  using  Chi-square  statistic;  the 
Fisher’s exact test may be used if the expected counts in some cells are small. 

Sensitivity  analysis  for  time  to  event  endpoints  using  non-stratified logrank  test  and  Cox 
proportional  hazards  model  will  also  be  performed  as  supportive  analyses.    Subgroup 
analyses will be carried out to assess if treatment effects are consistent within subgroup.

A large number of patient crossover may confound the analysis of the primary endpoint of 
overall survival. Therefore a per-protocol analysis removing patients who crossover may be 
conducted.  The accelerated failure time model with iterative parameter estimation method 
described by Branson and Whitehead (80) may also be used to obtain the point estimate of 
treatment  effect  and  its  associated  confidence  interval.  If  a  large  number  of  patients  are 
censored, the rank preserving failure time model described by Robins and Tsiatis (81) may 
also be considered in the overall assessment of the survival endpoint. 
9.8 Safety Evaluations

Safety analysis will be summarized using the Safety Population.

Extent of exposure to study drug will be summarized and details will be provided.

Treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) are those events that occur or worsen on or after 
first dose of study drug up through 30 days post last dose.  Adverse events will be coded 
using  the  MedDRA  coding  system  and  all  AEs  will  be  graded  according  to  the  National 
Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events,  version  3.0 
(NCI-CTCAE). 

Incidence of AEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), 
and will be presented by treatment groups and overall.  Adverse events will be summarized 
by grade, according to the worst grade experienced.  In addition, most frequently observed 
AEs will be summarized by treatment groups.  In the summary of AE, an AE occurs more 
than once within a SOC and PT will be counted only once using the worst grade experienced.  

Serious  AE  and  deaths  will  be  provided  in  a  listing.  All  adverse  events  resulting  in 
discontinuation, dose modification, dosing interruption, and/or treatment delay of study drug 
will also be listed and tabulated by preferred term.

Clinical laboratory test results will be collected pretreatment and through 30 days post last 
dose of study treatment.  All laboratory test results will be classified according to the NCI 
CTCAE v3.0 criteria.    Standard  reference  ranges  will  be  used  for  missing  or  discrepant

normal ranges.  Baseline laboratory test values are the results from the last blood samples 
drawn on or prior to the first day  of study treatment.  On-study laboratory  test values are 
those results from blood samples drawn after the first study treatment up until 30 days after 
the last dose of study treatment.

Mean change from baseline in laboratory test values at each visit will be provided.  On-study 
clinical laboratory test abnormalities will be summarized.  Shifts in laboratory test values will 
also be summarized.

9.8.1 Safety Analysis Population and Methods:

All patients who receive any part of a dose of abiraterone acetate or placebo will be analyzed 
for safety.  Safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively for vital signs, adverse events, 
clinical  laboratory  parameters,  and  ECG.  Serious  adverse  events  and  deaths,  and  patients 
discontinued from study treatment will be listed. 
9.9 Pharmacokinetics Analysis

Approximately  150-200  patients  are  scheduled  to  be  enrolled  at  selected  sites  for  the  PK 
assessment.  Based on the 1:1 randomization, this should yield approximately 75-100 patients 
on active treatment (abiraterone acetate).

Nonlinear  mixed  effects  modeling  will  be  used  to  develop  a  population  PK  model  for 
abiraterone  acetate  and  abiraterone  plasma  concentrations  in  CRPC  patients.    A  covariate 
analysis  will  be  performed  to  investigate  the  influence  of  patient  factors  on  the  apparent 
clearance of abiraterone.  Patient factors will include, but are not limited to, body weight, 
calculated creatinine clearance, liver function, sex, age, race, and time of meal relative to the 
time of dose administration.  Patient factors on other disposition (e.g., apparent volume of 
distribution)  and  absorption  parameters  will  be  tested  in  a  secondary  fashion.    A  separate 
report  will  be  generated  summarizing  the  results  from  the  PK  modeling  and  covariate 
analysis.
9.10 Other Assessments or Analyses

In addition, analysis of pharmacoeconomic data and production of a final pharmacoeconomic 
report will be handled separately from the final clinical study report.  Information obtained 
from the collection of  medical resource utilization data may be combined with other data, 
such as cost data or other clinical parameters, in the production of final pharmacoeconomic 
report.

The  investigator  undertakes  to  perform  the  study  in  accordance  with  ICH  Guidelines  per 
Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  and  the  applicable  regulatory  requirements.    A  copy  of  the 
guidelines will be available in the Investigator Site File.

It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that adequate time and appropriate resources 
are available at the investigational site prior to commitment to participate in this study.  The 
investigator should also be able to demonstrate a potential for recruiting the required number 
of suitable patients within the agreed recruitment period.

The  investigator  will  maintain  a  list  of  appropriately  qualified  persons  to  whom  the
investigator  has  delegated  significant  study-related  tasks.    An  up-to-date  copy  of  the 
curriculum vitae for the investigator and sub-investigator(s) will be provided to the sponsor
(or its representative) before starting the study. The investigator will inform the sponsor of 
any updates to the list of sub-investigators after the start of the study.

If  the  patient has  a  primary  physician,  the  investigator  should,  with  the  patient’s  consent, 
inform them of the patient’s participation in the study.

Agreement with the final clinical study report will be documented by the signed and dated 
signature of the principal or coordinating investigator in compliance with ICH E3.

10.1.2 Protocol Adherence and Investigator Agreement

The investigator must adhere to the protocol as detailed in this document.  The investigator 
will be responsible for enrolling only those patients who have met protocol eligibility criteria. 
The investigators will be required to sign an investigator agreement to confirm acceptance 
and willingness to comply with the study protocol.

It  is  the  investigator’s  responsibility  to  communicate  with  their  local  IRB/IEC  to  ensure 
accurate and timely information is provided at all phases during the study.  In particular, the 
appropriate  approvals  must  be  in  place  prior  to  recruitment,  and  the  IRB/IEC  must  be 
informed of study completion. The investigator should also notify the appropriate IRB or EC
of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from 
the sponsor, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.
10.2 Institutional Review  Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee 

(IEC) Approval

It is the responsibility of the investigator to submit this protocol, the final approved informed 
consent  document  (approved  by  the  sponsor or  its  representative),  relevant  supporting
information, and all types of patient recruitment or advertisement information (approved by

the study is initiated.  Prior to implementing changes in the study, the sponsor will produce a 
protocol amendment and the IRB/IEC must also approve any amendments to the protocol.

On  the  approval  letter,  the  study (title,  protocol  number  and  version),  the documents 
reviewed (protocol, informed consent material, amendments) and the date of review should 
be clearly stated.

Drug supplies will not be released and the patient recruitment will not begin until this written 
approval has been received by the sponsor or its designee.

The investigator is responsible for keeping the IRB/IEC apprised of the progress of the study 
and of any changes made to the protocol as deemed appropriate, but in any case at least once 
a year.  The investigator must also keep the IRB/IEC informed of any serious and significant 
adverse events.
10.3 Ethical Conduct of the Study

This protocol accords with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as set forth at the 
18th  World  Medicines  Association  (Helsinki  1964)  and  amendments  of  the  29th
(Tokyo 1975), the 35th (Venice 1983), the 41st (Hong Kong 1989), the 48th, and the 52nd 
(Edinburgh  2000)  World  Medicines  Association.    As  these  accords  are  reviewed  and 
amended periodically, the most current amended version will be in effect.
10.4 Patient Information and Consent

It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain written informed consent from patients. 
Each patient is requested to sign the Patient Information and Consent Form after the patient 
has  received  written  information  and  an  explanation  of  what  the  study  involves,  i.e.,  the 
objectives,  potential  benefits  and  risk,  inconveniences  and  the  patient’s  rights  and 
responsibilities.  A copy of the Patient Information and signed Consent Form must be given 
to the patient.  If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language.  
Signed  consent  forms  must  remain  in  each  patient’s  study  file  and  must  be  available  for 
verification by study monitors at any time.

If  the  IRB/IEC requires  modification  of  this  form,  the  documentation  supporting  this 
requirement  must  be  provided  to the  sponsor along  with  the  new  version.    The  sponsor
reserves  the  right  to  reject  these  modifications,  should  they  not  cover  the  minimum 
information required by ICH GCP.
10.5 Patient Confidentiality

Data  collected  during  this  study  may  be  used  to  support  the  development,  registration  or 
marketing of abiraterone acetate.  All data collected during the study will be controlled by the 
sponsor or designee and the sponsor will abide by all relevant data protection laws.  After 
patients have consented to take part in the study, their medical records and the data collected 
during  the  study  will  be  reviewed  by  representatives  of  the  sponsor and/or  the  company 
organizing the research on the sponsor’s behalf to confirm that the data collected are accurate 
and  for  the  purpose  of  analyzing  the  results.    These  records  and  data  may  additionally  be 

Confidential

reviewed by auditors or by regulatory authorities.  The patient’s name, however, will not be 
disclosed outside the hospital.  They will be known by a unique patient number.  The results 
of  this  study  may  be  used  in  other  countries  throughout  the  world  that have  ensured  an 
adequate level of protection for personal data.

Written Authorization (US sites only) or Data Protection Consent (European sites only) is to 
be obtained  from each patient prior to  enrollment into the study,  and/or  from the patient's 
legally authorized representative in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements [eg, 
the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  of  1996  Standards  for  Privacy  of 
Individually  Identifiable  Health  Information  (“HIPAA”),  European  Union  Data  Protection 
Directive 95/46/EC (“EU Directive”) and any other state and country privacy requirements].  
10.6 Study Monitoring

To  ensure  compliance  with  relevant  regulations,  data  generated  by  this  study  must  be 
available for inspection upon request by representatives of regulatory authorities, the sponsor
and its representatives, and the IRB/EC for each study site.  The sponsor may delegate some 
administrative  aspects  of  this  study  to  a  duly  authorized  representative  including,  but  not 
limited to, study initiation, monitoring, and management of SAE reports.

The  sponsor  or  representative’s  monitor  is  responsible  for  verifying  the  eCRFs at  regular 
intervals (approximately every 6-8 weeks) throughout the study to verify  adherence to the 
protocol;  completeness,  accuracy,  and  consistency  of  the  data;  and  adherence  to  local 
regulations  on  the  conduct  of  clinical  research.    The  monitor  should  have  access  to  the 
patients’ medical records and other study-related records needed to verify the entries on the 
eCRFs.
10.7 Case Report Forms 

Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be provided by the sponsor or its representative
and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the sponsor or its representative.

The  investigator  is  responsible  for  maintaining  adequate  and  accurate  eCRFs  which  have 
been designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation.  
Each eCRF should be filled out completely by the investigator or delegate as stated in the 
Site Delegation List.  All data captured for the study is planned to be electronic.  However, if 
necessary, data capture may be performed using paper CRFs. 

If paper CRFs are used, then all CRFs should be completed in a neat legible manner to ensure 
accurate interpretation of the data; a black ball-point pen should be used to ensure the clarity 
of reproduced copies of all CRFs. Incorrect entries should be crossed out with a single line.  
Corrections  must  be  made  adjacent  to  the  item  to  be  altered,  initialed  and  dated  with  the 
reason  for  the  correction  if  necessary,  by  an  authorized  (investigator/co-worker)  person.  
Overwriting of this information or use of liquid correcting fluid is not allowed.

The eCRFs should be reviewed, signed and dated by the investigator.

Once  the  site  monitor  has  verified  the  contents  of  the  completed  eCRF  pages  against  the 
source data, the EDC system will be locked for those pages.  Queries may be raised if the 
data are unclear or contradictory, which must be addressed by the investigator.
10.8 Laboratory Assessments

A Central Laboratory will be used to analyze all lab specimens collected for the study. In the 
rare instance when it is not possible for the site to send a sample to the central lab, the local 
laboratory results will be captured on supplemental lab eCRFs.
10.9 Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)

An external  Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will monitor and  advise on 
interim safety and efficacy aspects of the study and relevance of new external information as 
specified in the IDMC charter. Key safety and efficacy (e.g. SAEs) data will be provided to 
the  IDMC  with  treatment  groups  randomly  identified  (from  meeting  to  meeting)  as  either 
“X”  or  “Y”. Treatment  group  identification  may  be  obtained  from  the  Independent 
Biostatistician if the IDMC determines that unblinding is necessary to determine whether the 
study should be stopped early for either safety or efficacy.
10.10 Central Radiologic Review

All  CT,  MRI,  and  bone  scans  will  be  collected  centrally  for  independent  review  of 
radiographic progression (a primary endpoint in this study). 
10.11 Protocol Violations/Deviations

Protocol  violations  and deviations  should  be  reported  to the  sponsor (or  designee)  as  they
occur or are discovered and should be captured in eCRFs at the time of monitoring.
10.12 Access to Source Documentation

Source data to be reviewed during this study will include, but is not restricted to: original 
source  data  such  as  the  patient’s  medical  file,  patient’s  diary  cards (if  applicable),  and 
laboratory test, histology, and pathology reports.

All key data must be recorded in the patient’s hospital notes/medical chart.

The investigator will permit authorized representatives of the sponsor, the respective national 
or local health authorities, and auditors to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.

The  monitor  (or  auditors or  regulatory  inspectors)  will  check  the  CRF  entries  against  the 
source documents.  The consent form will include a statement by which the patients allow the 
monitor/auditor/inspector from the IEC/IRB or regulatory authority access to source data (eg, 
patient’s  medical  file,  appointment  books,  original  laboratory  test  reports,  X  rays  etc)  that 
substantiate information in the CRFs.  These personnel, bound by professional secrecy, will 
not disclose any personal information.

nominated  payee  the  sums  set  out  in  the  payment  schedule  attached  to  the  Investigator 
Agreement.
10.15 Study Publication Guidelines and Disclosure Policy

The sponsor encourages publication of results derived from the clinical research it sponsors.  
Publication includes  publication  of  a  paper  in  a  peer-reviewed  medical  journal,  abstract 
submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting, or making results public 
by  some  other  means.  The  sponsor  will  retain  the  right  to  review  all  material  prior  to 
presentation  or  submission  for  publication,  and  neither  institution(s)  nor  Study  Co-
Chairs/Principal Investigator(s) is/are permitted to publish/present the results of the study, in 
part or in their entirety, without the written authorization of the sponsor.  The review is aimed 
at  complying  with  21CFR312.7  (non  promotion  of  investigational  drugs)  as  well  as  the 
intellectual property rights and commercial interests of the sponsor.

10.15.1 First Publication

The Cycle 1 Day 1 visit may occur on the same day as the Screening Visit provided that all screening assessments 
have been completed and results reviewed prior to the commencement of Cycle 1 Day1 assessments. 
If patients continue on study without disease progression or discontinuation of treatment beyond Cycle 12, they 
should receive visit assessments as follows:

At all other cycles (i.e. Cycles 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21…) they should receive the same assessments as indicated for 

At Cycle 13 and every third cycle thereafter (i.e. Cycles 13, 16, 19, 22…), patients should receive the same 

-
assessments as indicated for Cycles 3, 5, 7, and 10. 
-
Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12.
Treatment Discontinuation Visit can occur at any scheduled or unscheduled visit when applicable. At this visit, 
documentation to confirm progressive disease is required.  
End of Study Treatment Visit should be scheduled to collect safety assessments between 15 to 28 days after the 
patient stops treatment. Patients will enter Follow up Phase at that time. 

5 Weight will be recorded at every indicated visit.  Height will be measured at Screening visit only.

Vitals include upright blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral or aural body temperature. 
ECGs should not be obtained when serum potassium is < 3.5mg/mL. Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to ECG 
collection.
A MUGA scan should be obtained at baseline (up to 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1). A cardiac ECHO can be used if 
MUGA is not available or when ECHO is standard of care at the study site.
Pre-Treatment SAEs should be reported from time patient signs a consent form up to Cycle 1 Day 1 treatment 
administration.

10 Adverse event follow-up is required for 30 days following last dose to determine if any new or ongoing drug related 

AE or any SAE regardless of relationship to drug exists.  Follow-up could be conducted by sites via telephone 
attempts and must be documented in source notes. 

11 If patient undergoes a digital rectal exam (DRE), PSA must be sampled prior to the DRE
12 Scans (CT, MRI, and Bone) performed up to 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 can be used for baseline assessments.
13 If disease progression is observed on the bone scan, confirmatory bone scan is required at least 6 weeks later. Study 

treatment should be continued in the interim unless there is unequivocal clinical progression as defined in Section 6.6. 
If the confirmatory scan is negative (does not confirm PD), then the patient should be seen again at the next scheduled 
study visit as specified in the protocol.

14 Selected Study Centers Only: PK blood samples collected pre and post dose at the following visits: Cycle 1 Day 1, 

Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 5 Day 1.  Patients will be asked to withhold their daily dose and take study treatment 
following pre-dose PK collection. 

15 Follow-up assessments may be collected by telephone interview or chart review. Information will be collected on 

overall survival, opiate use, ECOG performance status, next therapy for prostate cancer (including dose and treatment 
duration of cytotoxic chemotherapy), and study treatment related SAEs.

16 Liver function tests include: ALK-P, ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), LDH, and direct and total bilirubin
17 Informed consent may be obtained prior to Day -14, as long as it is obtained before any study-specific procedures are 

completed.
Shipment of samples to the central laboratory for biomarker analysis can be completed at any point after Screening.

Appendix 2: Study Treatment Preparation and Dispensing Instructions

Labeling/Packaging

Study treatment (abiraterone acetate and placebo) will be provided to each site packaged for 
patient assignment at the time of randomization.  Packaging includes a 30-day supply.  Site 
pharmacist will dispense the study treatment to each patient in accordance with this protocol 
under the guidelines of the site’s dispensation standard operating procedure.

Storage of Study Treatments

The study treatment must be stored in a secure area and administered only to patients who 
entered into the clinical  study, at no cost to the patient, in accordance with the conditions 
specified in this protocol.

Investigational product should be stored at the study site at a room temperature between 15ºC 
to 30º C; 59º-86º F.  Bottles of study drug should be stored with the cap on tightly and should 
not be refrigerated as this is a high relative humidity environment.

Clinical Supply Inventory

The  investigator  must  keep  an  accurate  accounting  of  the  number  of  investigational  units 
received  from the  sponsor,  dispensed  to  the  patients,  the  number  of  units  returned  to  the 
investigator by the patient, and the number of units returned to the sponsor during and at the 
completion of the study.  A detailed inventory must be completed for the study treatment.  
The study treatment must be dispensed only by an appropriately qualified person to patients 
in the study.  The treatment is to be used in accordance with the protocol by patients who are 
under the direct supervision of an investigator.

Return or Disposal of Study Medications/Treatments

All  clinical  study  treatments  will  be  returned  to the  sponsor or  destroyed  at  the  site  as 
specified in writing by the sponsor.

Destruction  of  study  treatments  at  the  site  should  be  done  in  the  presence  of  a sponsor
representative.  Alternatively, destruction of the treatments may be carried out by a suitably 
qualified person based on written instructions from the sponsor.

Quick  Reference  for  the  COU-AA-302  study:  A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Double-blind, 
Placebo  Controlled  Study  of  Abiraterone  Acetate  (CB7630)  Plus  Prednisone 
in 
Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate 
Cancer 

Eligibility

 RECIST criteria will be used on measurable soft tissue and visceral lesions

 Measurable  disease  - the  presence  of  at  least  one  measurable  lesion.    If  the 
measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be 
confirmed by cytology/histology. 

 Measurable lesions – Visceral or extranodal lesions need to be at least ≥ 10 mm in 
one dimension using spiral CT; however, lymph nodes need to be ≥ 20 mm in at 
least  one  dimension  to  be  considered  as  target  or  evaluable  lesions  to  assess 
changes in size.

 Non-measurable  lesions  - all  other  lesions,  including  small  lesions  (longest 
diameter  [LD]  <20 mm),  i.e.,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural/pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, 
and  also  abdominal  masses  that  are  not  confirmed  and  followed  by  imaging 
techniques.

 For  this  study,  bone  lesions  are  not considered  “non-measurable”  lesions  for 

RECIST. Bone lesions will be assessed by bone scan only. 

 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 28 days before the beginning of the 
treatment; nodal and visceral/extra-nodal disease will be recorded separately.

 The  same  method  of  assessment  and  the  same  technique  should  be  used  to 

characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 

 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., 
skin  nodules  and  palpable  lymph  nodes).    For  the  case  of  skin  lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is recommended.

Clinical Study Protocol: COU-AA-302
Methods of Measurement

December 17, 2013

 CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure 
target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI should 
be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously.  Spiral 
CT should be performed using a ≤ 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  

 Lesions on chest X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 

defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable. 

 Ultrasound (US), endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to measure tumor 

lesions. 

 Cytology  and histology  can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases  (e.g.,  after  treatment  to  differentiate  between  residual  benign  lesions  and 
residual malignant lesions.

Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” Lesions

 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in 
total,  representative  of  all  involved  organs  should  be  identified  as  target  lesions
and recorded and measured at baseline. 

 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter)  and  their  suitability  for  accurate  repeated  measurements  (either  by 
imaging techniques or clinically). 

 A  sum  of  the  LD  for  all  target  lesions will  be  calculated  and  reported  as  the 
baseline  sum  LD.    The  baseline  sum  LD  will  be  used  as  reference  by  which  to 
characterize the objective tumor.

 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should  also  be  recorded  at  baseline.    Measurements  of  these  lesions  are  not 
required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-
up.

Evaluation of Target Lesions
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions
* Partial Response (PR):

At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD

* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 

* Stable Disease (SD):

lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded 
since the treatment started or the appearance of one or 
more new lesions
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference 
the smallest sum LD since the treatment started

Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 

* Incomplete Response/ 
Stable Disease (SD): 

normalization of tumor marker level
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits

* Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of new lesions and/or unequivocal 

progression of existing non-target lesions (1) 

(1) Although a clear progression of “non target” lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the 

treating physician should prevail. 

Evaluation of Best Overall Response

The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease  progression/recurrence  (taking  as  reference  for  PD  the  smallest  measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria

 Patients  with  a  global  deterioration  of  health  status  requiring  discontinuation  of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 



In  some  circumstances  it  may  be  difficult  to  distinguish  residual  disease  from 
normal  tissue.  When  the  evaluation  of  complete  response  depends  on  this 
determination,  it  is  recommended  that the  residual  lesion  be  investigated  (fine 
needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status.

Duration of Overall Response

 The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that 
recurrence  or  PD  is  objectively  documented,  taking  as  reference  for  PD  the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

Duration of Stable Disease

 Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.

Reporting of Results

 All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even 
if  there  are  major  protocol  treatment  deviations  or  if  they  are  ineligible.    Each 
patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) 
partial  response,  3) stable  disease,  4)  progressive  disease,  5)  early  death  from 
malignant  disease,  6)  early  death  from  toxicity,  7)  early  death  because  of  other 
cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).

 All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main 
analysis  of  the  response  rate.    Patients  in  response  categories  4-9  should  be 
considered  as  failing  to  respond  to  treatment  (disease  progression).    Thus,  an 
incorrect  treatment  schedule  or  drug  administration  does  not  result  in  exclusion 
from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories 4-9 will 
be protocol specific.

 All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.

 Sub-analyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding 
those  for  whom  major  protocol  deviations  have  been  identified.  However,  these 
subanalyses  may  not  serve  as  the  basis  for  drawing  conclusions  concerning 
treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should 
be clearly reported.  

 The 95% confidence intervals should be provided

Appendix 11: Eligibility Criteria and Modified Schedule of Events for Patients 
who Crossover from Placebo to Abiraterone Acetate After Study 
Unblinding

The clinical cutoff to perform the second interim analysis (planned 40% of death events) was 
reached on 20 December 2011. The IDMC met on 27 February 2012 to review the efficacy 
and  safety  outcomes  of  the  prespecified  COU-AA-302  interim  analysis  (IA 43%  of  death
events). The  IDMC  concluded  that  the  OS,  rPFS, and  secondary  endpoint  outcomes  all 
pointed to a significant advantage in favor of the abiraterone acetate group and unanimously 
recommended stopping  the  study, unblinding, and  crossover  of  patients  on  placebo  to 
abiraterone acetate. The interim analysis also confirmed abiraterone acetate’s tolerability and 
acceptable  safety  profile. Protocol  Amendment  3  (v4.0)  allows for  crossover,  providing
abiraterone  acetate  to patients
in  the  placebo group  who  are  currently receiving 
treatment. Patients who received abiraterone acetate prior to the unblinding will continue to 
follow the Schedule of Events in Appendix 1 as they normally would.

clinically and statistically significant effects on the 3 key secondary endpoints. No new safety 
signals were identified.

Patients who received placebo prior to the unblinding must meet all of the eligibility criteria 
for crossover therapy listed in this appendix. They will then follow the schedule of events in 
this appendix, entitled, “Patients Starting Abiraterone Acetate after Placebo.”

Treatment will be continued until the patient meets the treatment discontinuation criteria in 
Section 6.6 or 6.7.

Schedule of Events for Patients who Crossover from Placebo to Abiraterone Acetate
The new crossover Cycle 1 Day 1 visit may occur on the same day as the Screening Visit provided that all screening 
assessments have been completed and results reviewed prior to the commencement of Cycle 1 Day1 assessments. 
If patients continue on study without disease progression or discontinuation of treatment beyond Cycle 12, they 
should receive visit assessments as follows:

1

2

At Cycle 13 and every third cycle thereafter (i.e. Cycles 13, 16, 19, 22…), patients should receive the same 

At all other cycles (i.e. Cycles 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21…) they should receive the same assessments as indicated for 

-
assessments as indicated for Cycles 3, 5, 7, and 10. 
-
Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12.
Treatment Discontinuation Visit can occur at any scheduled or unscheduled visit when applicable. At this visit, 
documentation to confirm progressive disease is required.  
End of Study Treatment Visit should be scheduled to collect safety assessments between 15 to 28 days after the 
patient stops treatment. Patients will enter Follow up Phase at that time. 
Informed consent may be obtained prior to Day -30, as long as it is obtained before any study-specific procedures are 
completed.

Vitals include upright blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral or aural body temperature. 
ECGs should not be obtained when serum potassium is < 3.5mg/mL. Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to ECG 
collection.
A cardiac ECHO can be used if MUGA is not available or when ECHO is standard of care at the study site.

9
10 Adverse event follow-up is required for 30 days following last dose to determine if any new or ongoing drug related 

AE or any SAE regardless of relationship to drug exists.  Follow-up could be conducted by sites via telephone 
attempts and must be documented in source notes. 

11 Liver function tests include: ALK-P, ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), LDH, and direct and total bilirubin
12 If patient undergoes a digital rectal exam (DRE), PSA must be sampled prior to the DRE
13 If disease progression is observed on the bone scan, confirmatory bone scan is required at least 6 weeks later. Study 

treatment should be continued in the interim unless there is unequivocal clinical progression as defined in Section 6.6. 
If the confirmatory scan is negative (does not confirm PD), then the patient should be seen again at the next scheduled 
study visit as specified in the protocol.

14 Applies only if sample not already submitted prior to un-blinding: shipment of samples to the central laboratory for 

biomarker analysis can be completed at any point after Screening.

15 Follow-up assessments may be collected by telephone interview or chart review. Information will be collected on 

overall survival, opiate use, ECOG performance status, next therapy for prostate cancer (including dose and treatment 
duration of cytotoxic chemotherapy), and study treatment related SAEs.

Appendix 12: Eligibility Criteria and Modified Schedule of Events for Patients 

Formerly on Placebo and in Long-term Follow-up

As  summarized  in  Appendix  11,  after  a  review  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  the 
second interim analysis of OS, the IDMC unanimously recommended the study be unblinded 
and  patients  on  placebo plus  prednisone be  crossed  over  to  abiraterone  acetate plus 
prednisone.  The  study  was  unblinded  and  protocol  Amendment  3  (v4.0)  allowed  for 
crossover,  providing  abiraterone  acetate  to  patients  on placebo  who  were  still  receiving 
treatment. Protocol Amendment 4 (v5.0) will allow those patients formerly on placebo and
who are now in long-term follow-up to receive abiraterone acetate treatment. 

Patients  who  formerly  received  placebo plus  prednisone and  are  currently  in  long-term 
follow-up  must  meet  all  of  the  eligibility  criteria  listed  in  this  appendix  before  they  can 
receive abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. They will follow the schedule of events in this 
appendix, entitled, “Schedule of Events for Patients Formerly on Placebo and Crossing Over
to Abiraterone Acetate from Long-term Follow-up.”

Eligibility Criteria for Patients Formerly on Placebo who Crossover to Abiraterone 
Acetate from Long-term Follow-up

1. Previous  participation  in  the  placebo  arm  of  Study  COU-AA-302  and  currently  in 

long-term follow-up.

2. Patient  is  willing  and  able  to  provide  written  informed  consent  to  receive  abiraterone 

acetate therapy.
Investigator’s assessment that abiraterone acetate therapy will be safe and beneficial.
If subject received therapy with mitoxantrone, MUGA/ECHO must be ≥50%.

3.
4.
5. Not currently receiving prostate cancer treatment other than LHRH analogues. Patients 
who have received chemotherapy should have received the last dose of chemotherapy at 
least 4 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1 of crossover. 

6. The safety of concomitant cytotoxic chemotherapy and abiraterone acetate treatment has 
not  been  established.  No  cytoxtoxic  chemotherapy  should  be  administered  while  the 
patient is receiving abiraterone acetate treatment. 

7. ECOG performance status of 0,1, or 2.
Treatment will be continued until the investigator determines that the patient is not receiving 
benefit  from  continued  treatment  with  abiraterone  acetate,  the  patient  needs  to  start  other 
anti-cancer  treatment,  the  patient  withdraws  consent,  or  the  study  is  terminated  by  the 
sponsor.  If the study has not been terminated or the patient did not withdraw consent, the 
patient will re-enter the long-term follow-up phase as described in the main protocol.

December 17, 2013
Appendix 13: Modified Schedule of Events for Patients Continuing to Receive 
Abiraterone Acetate Treatment after the Clinical Cut Off Date for 
Final Analysis (CCO-FA) for Overall Survival

Protocol  Amendment  5  (v6.0)  provides instructions  for  the  follow-up  of  patients  who 
continue to receive treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone after the 
Clinical Cut-Off Date for Final Analysis (CCO-FA) for Overall Survival.  Patients will be 
discontinued from long term follow-up at the time of CCO-FA.

This  amendment  also  provides  guidance  for  the  use  of  strong  inducers  of  CYP3A4  with 
abiraterone acetate (see Section 5.8.1).

Study  COU-AA-302  was  designed  to  perform  the  final  overall  survival  analysis  after 
approximately  773  death  events  had  occurred. Protocol  Amendment  5  (v6.0)  will  allow 
those patients who were receiving abiraterone acetate at the time of the CCO-FA to continue 
to receive abiraterone acetate for up to 3 years from the CCO-FA or until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first. 

Study Evaluations after the CCO-FA Date
Suggested timing and assessments are outlined in the Schedule of Events below.  While the 
protocol  provides  recommendations  for  assessments  and  monitoring  for  the  period  after 
CCO-FA,  the  timing  of  assessments  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator, according  to 
approved  Product  Information.
Investigators  should  monitor  and  assess  the  subjects  for 
response  to  treatment  or  disease  progression  according  to  routine  practice. No  further 
efficacy data are being collected by the sponsor.

Information  regarding serious  adverse  events  (as  defined  in  Section  6.5.1.2)  will  be 
transmitted to the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form, which must be completed 
and signed by a member of the investigational staff, and transmitted to the sponsor within 
24 hours.  The initial and follow-up reports of a serious adverse event should be made by 
facsimile (fax). No other safety data will be collected by the sponsor.  An End-of-Treatment 
Visit or phone call for a safety assessment should take place at least 30 days after the last 
dose of abiraterone acetate.

Dosage and Administration
Abiraterone acetate will be given orally as tablets according to the regimen established prior 
to the CCO-FA date. Treatment will be continued until the investigator determines that the 
patient is not receiving benefit from continued treatment with abiraterone acetate, the patient 
needs to start other anti-cancer treatment or the patient withdraws consent.

Efficacy Evaluations after CCO-FA Date
Investigators  should  monitor  and  assess  the  subjects  for  response  to  treatment  or  disease 
progression according to routine practice.  No efficacy data will be collected by the sponsor 
after the CCO-FA date.

Safety Evaluations after CCO-FA Date
Safety  assessment  as  outlined  in the  Schedule  of  Events  provided  in  Appendix  13 will  be 
performed  while  continuing  treatment  and  for  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of  abiraterone

acetate. Only  SAEs  will  be  collected  and  reported.  Any  serious  adverse  event  occurring 
during the study must be reported to the sponsor by investigational staff within 24 hours of 
their knowledge of the event. The sponsor will only collect serious adverse event data by the 
serious  adverse  event  reporting  process  as  described  above.    No  other  safety  data  will  be 
collected by the sponsor.

Treatment Phase after CCO-FA Date
Patients  must  sign  an  updated  informed  consent  form  to  continue  in  the  study  after  the 
CCO-FA date.    During  the  treatment  phase,  patients  will  receive  daily  treatment  with  the 
abiraterone  acetate  and  prednisone/prednisolone dosing  regimen  they  received  prior  to  the 
CCO-FA date.  Patient’s visits will be registered in the IXRS® system and the dispensing of 
study  medication  and  drug  accountability  will  occur  every  3  months.    Patients  will  be 
supplied 3 months of study drug at each visit.  For consistency, the patients will not restart 
their cycle number.  Cycle “X” will be the first cycle after the patient completes all scheduled 
assessments up to the CCO-FA date, as described under protocol amendment 4. 

Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing Instructions
Study  drug  administration  and  dosing  compliance  should  be  assessed  every  3  months.  A 
count of all study drug provided by the sponsor will be conducted in the Treatment Phase.

The  study  site  must  maintain  accurate  drug  accountability  records  including  dates  and 
amount  of  study  drug  received,  to  whom  dispensed  (subject  by  subject  accounting),  and 
accounts of any study drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed.  Reconciliation must be 
made between the amount of study drug supplied, dispensed, and subsequently destroyed or 
returned to sponsor or its representative.

End-of-Treatment Visit after the CCO-FA Date
This  visit can  take  place  as  a  scheduled  visit  or  a  phone  call  at  the  discretion of  the 
investigator.

Subject Completion
A subject is considered to have completed the study after discontinuing treatment for any 
reason and having had a follow-up safety assessment at least 30 days after the last dose of 
abiraterone acetate or is lost to follow-up.

Subject Withdrawal From the Study
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:

 Lost to follow-up
 Withdrawal of consent
 Discontinuation of study treatment

A subject's study treatment will be discontinued if:

 The investigator or sponsor believes (eg, for safety or tolerability reasons such as 

an adverse event) that it is in the best interest of the subject to stop treatment

 The investigator believes the subject is no longer receiving clinical benefit from 

continued abiraterone acetate treatment

 The sponsor terminates the study

Source Documentation
At a minimum, the type and level of detail of source data available for a study subject
should be consistent with that commonly recorded at the site as a basis for standard medical
care.  This  should  also  include:  subject
identification  and study identification; study
discussion and date of u p d a t e d   informed consent; dates of  visits;  drug  receipt/ 
dispensing/ return records and study drug administration information.

Study Completion
After the CCO-FA, the study is considered completed with the last End-of-Treatment safety 
assessment for the last subject receiving study medication in the study or upon a decision by 
the sponsor to terminate the study.

Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study at any
time or any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor.
Investigational sites will be
closed upon  study completion. An investigational site is considered closed when all
required documents and study supplies have been collected and a site closure visit has been 
performed.
