Introduction

1.1. Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and the leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality.  For 2007, the American Cancer Society (ACS) projected 1.5 million new cases and 
1,351,000 deaths worldwide (ACS 2007), despite improvements in lung cancer care that have 
occurred over the past 2 decades.  In 2008, an estimated 215,020 new cases of lung cancer and 
161,840 deaths from lung cancer are predicted to occur in the United States (ACS 2008).  
Approximately 85% of lung cancers are non-small cell (NSCLC; Lustberg and Edelman 2007), 
and approximately 70% of patients with NSCLC present with inoperable, locally advanced 
(Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) disease (Boulikas and Vougiouka 2004).
1.2. Current Treatment of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Most patients with inoperable NSCLC are candidates for palliative chemotherapy consisting of 
standard induction therapy with 4 to 6 cycles of a platinum-based chemotherapy doublet, per 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO [Pfister et al. 2004]) and European Society for 
Medical Oncology (ESMO [D’Addario and Felip 2008]) guidelines.
Recent reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials in advanced NSCLC have suggested that 
4 cycles is the optimal duration of platinum-based first-line treatment, regardless of response to 
initial therapy;  platinum-based chemotherapy beyond 4 cycles was found to improve 
progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS), and led to increased toxicity 
(Larsen et al. 1995; Smith et al. 2001; Socinski et al. 2002; Lustberg and Edelman 2007; Park et 
al. 2007; Socinski and Stinchcombe 2007; Soon et al. 2007).
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a randomized study comparing 4 
of the platinum-based doublets most commonly used in the United States (cisplatin-paclitaxel 
[control], cisplatin-gemcitabine, cisplatin-docetaxel, and carboplatin-paclitaxel).  The study 
(ECOG 1594) demonstrated no significant difference among study arms with respect to response 
rate (RR) or OS (Schiller et al. 2002), and ECOG chose carboplatin-paclitaxel as its reference 
regimen for future studies.
In 2006, bevacizumab received FDA approval as an initial therapy for advanced NSCLC on the 
basis of Study ECOG 4599 (Sandler et al. 2006; see Section 1.4.1).  Approval was based on 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 14

improvement in OS for bevacizumab when combined with carboplatin-paclitaxel, as compared 
with the platinum doublet alone.  This triplet regimen is now recommended by the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN 2008) for patients with advanced, nonsquamous 
NSCLC and has become a standard of care in that setting.
Maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC has also been explored in a large number of studies, 
although most were powered only for assessment of the entire regimen, and not just the 
maintenance phase of therapy (Prior et al. 1999; Socinski et al. 2002; Belani et al. 2004, 2005; 
Herbst et al. 2004; Brodowicz et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2006; Sandler et al. 2006; Manegold et 
al. 2007).  Despite methodological problems, studies with docetaxel (Sekine et al. 2006; Fidias et 
al. 2007), paclitaxel (Belani et al. 2005), gemcitabine (Brodowicz et al. 2006), and bevacizumab 
(Sandler et al. 2006) have suggested possible benefit of single-agent treatment beyond the 
recommended 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy.
Second-line therapy with agents such as pemetrexed, docetaxel, and erlotinib constitutes a 
standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC.  Such therapy should be instituted upon 
documentation of progression in suitable patients (suitability based upon performance status 
[PS], laboratory values, and need for other treatments).  Alternatively, treatment with novel 
agents on approved clinical trials is also suitable and represents a standard of care.  Supportive 
care alone should be discussed with patients as well, and is most appropriate for those with 
compromised PS (ECOG > 2).
1.3. Pemetrexed
Pemetrexed, a novel, multitargeted, antifolate antineoplastic agent approved for the first-line 
treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and the second-line treatment of NSCLC, is the 
chemotherapy agent most recently demonstrated to have activity in the first-line (Scagliotti et al. 
2008) and maintenance treatment (Ciuleanu et al. 2008) of NSCLC.
The antitumor activity of pemetrexed likely derives from inhibition of several key 
folate-requiring enzymes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), 
and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT) (Shih et al. 1997).  This diversity of 
enzyme targets and the potential to overcome inherent resistance suggest that pemetrexed could 
have a greater degree and broader scope of antitumor activity than other antifolate therapies, 
such as methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.  The mechanisms of action and molecular 
pharmacology of pemetrexed are well characterized (Shih et al. 1998).  This allows for 
correlative research of biomarkers in tumor samples that may be predictive for high clinical 
benefit from pemetrexed-containing treatment.
The observed side effects of pemetrexed are similar to those of other antifolate therapies.  These 
side effects include myelosuppression (mainly transient neutropenia), oral mucositis, diarrhea, 
and skin rash.  Supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 reduces the severity and 
frequency of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities.  Pemetrexed has been investigated in a 
number of tumor types as a single agent and in combination with other cytotoxic agents.  More 
detailed information about the known benefits and risks of pemetrexed may be found in the 
investigator's brochure (Lilly 2008).

1.3.1. Single-Agent Pemetrexed in Second-Line NSCLC
Global regulatory approvals of pemetrexed for the second-line treatment of patients with NSCLC 
were granted on the basis of the pivotal, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study, H3E-MC-JMEI 
(JMEI).  Patients with Stage III or IV NSCLC received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 or docetaxel 75 
mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression.  In this study of 571 patients, 
pemetrexed resulted in clinically similar efficacy outcomes with significantly fewer side effects 
compared with docetaxel, the established standard of care (Hanna et al. 2004).  The RR was 
9.1% and 8.8% for pemetrexed and docetaxel respectively, median PFS was 2.9 months in each 
arm, median OS was 8.3 and 7.9 months for pemetrexed and docetaxel respectively, and the 1-
year survival was 29.7% in each arm.
Subsequently, a retrospective subgroup analysis of Study JMEI revealed statistically significant 
treatment-by-histology interactions for OS (p = 0.001) and PFS (p = 0.004) (Peterson et al. 
2007).  In the nonsquamous population, improved survival was demonstrated for patients who 
received pemetrexed compared with patients who received docetaxel, consistent with the 
statistically significant treatment-by-histology interaction (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.778; 
95% confidence interval [CI]:  0.607 to 0.997; p = 0.047; 9.3 months versus 8.0 months).  
Patients with predominantly squamous cell histology had shorter OS time with pemetrexed 
compared with docetaxel (adjusted HR 1.563; 95% CI:  1.079 to 2.264; p = 0.018; 6.2 months 
versus 7.4 months).  No clinically relevant differences were observed for the safety profile of 
pemetrexed between the histologic subgroups.  Because this was a retrospective analysis, the
potential for different treatment results based on NSCLC histology was further evaluated in 
planned analyses for Studies H3E-MC-JMDB (JMDB) and H3E-MC-JMEN (JMEN) 
(Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3).
1.3.2. Pemetrexed plus Cisplatin in First-Line NSCLC
Data from the multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study, JMDB, formed the basis for 
global applications to regulatory authorities for the initial treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC (first-line NSCLC).  Study JMDB, which compared pemetrexed 
500 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle (PC) versus gemcitabine 
1250 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle (GC), met 
its primary endpoint and demonstrated that OS with PC was noninferior to GC, with significantly 
fewer side effects (Manegold et al. 2007; Scagliotti et al. 2008).
In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all histologies), the 2 arms of the study were equivalent in 
terms of OS (unadjusted HR 0.93; 95% CI:  0.83 to 1.04; median 10.3 months for both arms), 
PFS (unadjusted HR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.15; median 4.8 and 5.1 months for the pemetrexed 
and gemcitabine arms, respectively), and RR (30.6% versus 28.2% for the pemetrexed versus the 
gemcitabine arm).
Preplanned analyses evaluating the differences in OS with respect to baseline patient and disease 
characteristics identified a differential effect on survival according to NSCLC histologic 
subgroups.  Overall survival time with PC was statistically superior to GC in patients with 
nonsquamous histology (adjusted HR 0.844; 95% CI:  0.74 to 0.96; p = 0.01 [data on file]).  For 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 16

patients with squamous histology, OS time with PC was shorter than with GC (adjusted HR 
1.229; 95% CI:  1.00 to 1.51; p = 0.050).
The results of Study JMDB are currently under review by the FDA.  In April 2008, the European 
Medicines Agency issued an approval for use of pemetrexed with cisplatin in the initial treatment 
of NSCLC other than predominantly squamous histology.  The previously approved indication 
for use in second-line NSCLC was amended to include NSCLC with other than predominantly 
squamous histology only.
1.3.3. Pemetrexed Maintenance Therapy in NSCLC
Pemetrexed was then tested in the maintenance setting in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, Phase 3 study, JMEN.  In this trial, patients received 4 cycles of induction therapy 
with 1 of 6 standard regimens (gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel, with either carboplatin or 
cisplatin); regimen selection was at the discretion of the investigator.  Patients who achieved 
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) were randomized to 
maintenance with pemetrexed plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC until 
progression (Ciuleanu et al. 2008).
Study JMEN demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS following induction chemotherapy 
for patients receiving pemetrexed maintenance therapy compared with placebo (unadjusted HR 
0.60; 95% CI:  0.49 to 0.73; p < 0.00001; 4.04 versus 1.97 months) (data on file).  In patients 
with nonsquamous histology, median PFS for patients receiving pemetrexed versus placebo was 
4.4 months versus 1.8 months (unadjusted HR 0.47; 95% CI:  0.37 to 0.60; p < 0.00001).  With 
55% censoring, preliminary OS following induction chemotherapy in the overall study 
population was 13.0 months with pemetrexed and 10.6 months with placebo (unadjusted HR 
0.798; 95% CI:  0.63 to 1.01; p = 0.06).  In the nonsquamous population median OS was 
14.4 months for pemetrexed-treated patients and 9.4 months for patients on placebo (unadjusted 
HR 0.66; 95% CI:  0.49 to 0.88; p = 0.005).  In the squamous group, median OS was 9.6 and 
11.9 months for pemetrexed and placebo treatment, respectively (unadjusted HR 1.28; 95% CI:  
0.85 to 1.93; p = 0.231).
Response to maintenance therapy, analyzed according to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) guidelines (Therasse et al. 2000), was significantly higher for the pemetrexed arm 
(3.4%; 95% CI:  0.02 to 0.06) compared with the placebo arm (0.5%; 95% CI:  0.00 to 0.03; 
p = 0.042).  Results of the analysis of disease control rate (DCR; CR+PR+SD) also demonstrated 
a significant improvement for patients receiving pemetrexed (49.1%; 95% CI:  0.44 to 0.54) 
compared with patients receiving placebo (28.9%; 95% CI:  0.23 to 0.36; p < 0.001).
1.3.4. Pemetrexed plus Carboplatin in NSCLC
The combination of pemetrexed and carboplatin was first tested in Study H3E-MC-JMAU, a 
Phase 1 mesothelioma study that verified the safety of the combination (Hughes et al. 2002).  A 
32% RR was noted, with acceptable toxicity.
The Phase 2 studies H3E-MC-JMEK (JMEK) and H3E-MC-JMEZ (JMEZ) examined 
pemetrexed with carboplatin and vitamin supplementation to determine whether the combination 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 17

would maintain the efficacy achieved with pemetrexed plus cisplatin in advanced NSCLC 
(Manegold et al. 2000; Shepherd et al. 2001).
In Study JMEK, 83 chemonaive patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC were randomized to
receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus either carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 6 
(41 patients) or oxaliplatin 120 mg/m2 (42 patients) on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle, for up to 6 
cycles of therapy (Scagliotti et al. 2005).  In the pemetrexed-carboplatin arm, 12 of the 38 
evaluable patients (31.6%) had best overall responses of PR and 17 (44.7%) had best overall 
responses of SD.  Median TTPD was 5.7 months, the 1-year survival rate was 43.9%, and 
median OS was 10.5 months.  Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 10 (25.6%) of 39 patients 
evaluable for safety.  Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 7 (17.9%) patients.  Grade 3 
events also included anemia and fatigue, each reported in 3 (7.7%) patients, and stomatitis and 
febrile neutropenia, each reported in 1 (2.6%) patient.  One (2.6%) patient experienced Grade 4 
infection without neutropenia.
In Study JMEZ, 50 chemonaive patients with Stage IIIB (with effusion) or IV NSCLC received 
pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (Zinner et 
al. 2005).  Twelve patients (24%) had PRs, and 25 (50%) had SD.  Median TTPD was 5.4 
months, the 1-year survival rate was 56%, and median OS was 13.5 months.  Grade 3/4 
neutropenia was observed in 13 (26%) patients.  One (2%) patient had Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia, and 1 (2%) patient had Grade 4 anemia.  Three (6%) patients experienced 
Grade 3 nonhematologic side effects (nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and vomiting).
These Phase 2 trials demonstrated that the combination of pemetrexed with carboplatin is 
tolerable and that its activity in first-line treatment of advanced-stage NSCLC is comparable with 
other standard platinum doublets commonly used in clinical practice (Kelly et al. 2001; Scagliotti 
et al. 2002; Schiller et al. 2002; Fossella et al. 2003).  The toxicity with the pemetrexed and 
carboplatin combination appears to be less than that seen with other standard regimens in first-
line NSCLC.
1.4. Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF).  Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors 
(Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells.  The interaction of VEGF with its receptors 
leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models of 
angiogenesis.  By blocking the endothelial interaction of VEGF and its receptors, bevacizumab 
serves as an antiangiogenic agent.
Bevacizumab has been studied in more than 5000 patients and in multiple tumor types in Phase 
1, 2, and 3 clinical trials.  In addition, data are available from 3863 patients enrolled in 2 
postmarketing studies in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).  Approximately 130,000 patients 
have been exposed to bevacizumab as a marketed product or in clinical trials.

1.4.1. Bevacizumab in NSCLC
In the Genentech-sponsored, randomized, Phase 2 study AVF0757g, bevacizumab was added to 
the ECOG reference regimen established in Study ECOG 1594 (carboplatin-paclitaxel; see 
Section 1.2).  This Phase 2 study identified a relationship between fatal hemoptysis and central 
lesions with squamous histology in lung cancer patients treated with bevacizumab (Johnson et al. 
2004).  Based on these safety data, the subsequent Phase 3 study excluded patients with 
predominantly squamous cell carcinoma, hemoptysis, or both.  
The Phase 3 study (ECOG 4599) randomized patients to either 
carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab or carboplatin-paclitaxel-placebo (Sandler et al. 2006).  
Patients who received 6 cycles of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy without progression 
continued on single-agent bevacizumab until progression.  Median OS was 12.3 months for 
patients on the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy arm compared with 10.3 months for patients 
receiving carboplatin plus paclitaxel (HR 0.79; 95% CI:  0.67 to 0.92; p = 0.003).  One-and 
2-year survival rates were 51% and 23% for the Sandler regimen, compared with 44% and 15% 
for the chemotherapy-only regimen.  The RR was 35% (133/381) for patients on bevacizumab 
and 15% (59/392) for patients on chemotherapy only (p < 0.001).
The addition of bevacizumab resulted in modest changes to the expected toxicity profiles of 
chemotherapy alone (Genentech 2007).  A number of safety signals, similar to those found in 
other bevacizumab studies, such as epistaxis, hypertension, and proteinuria, were identified, the 
majority of which were of low grade and did not require discontinuation of bevacizumab.  Study 
ECOG 4599 suggested that the addition of a third noncytotoxic agent and/or maintenance 
therapy with an agent of low toxicity could result in improved outcomes in patients with 
advanced NSCLC.  This study demonstrated that the treatment paradigm for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC (bevacizumab eligible) is different than the treatment paradigm for 
patients with squamous histology NSCLC based on a difference in safety (NCCN 2008).
1.4.2. Phase 2 Studies of Bevacizumab in Combination with 

Pemetrexed and Carboplatin in NSCLC

In the nonrandomized, Phase 2 study H3E-US-X027, 50 chemonaive patients with Stage IIIB 
(with pleural effusions) or IV nonsquamous cell NSCLC received up to six 21-day cycles of 
induction bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in combination with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin 
AUC 6.  Patients with CR, PR, or SD continued maintenance treatment with pemetrexed 500 
mg/m2 and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.  Patients 
received a median of 6 cycles (induction plus maintenance); 30 (60%) patients completed at least 
6 cycles, 9 (18%) patients completed at least 18 cycles, and 7 (14%) patients completed at least 
24 cycles of therapy (Patel et al. 2008).  
Four patients in Study X027 developed complications of their known diverticular disease (Patel 
et al. 2007; McKoy et al. 2008).  Three of the 4 patients had underlying diverticulosis and 
developed diverticulitis on study; 2 of these patients developed Grade 3 diverticulitis and 1 
developed Grade 4 diverticulitis with bowel perforation.  The fourth patient had a known history 
of diverticulitis and developed an episode of Grade 3 diverticulitis on study.  As a result of these 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 19

episodes of diverticulitis (Grade 3 in 3 [6%] patients and Grade 4 in 1 [2%] patient), the protocol 
was amended to exclude patients with prior history of diverticulitis or diverticulosis; no 
additional episodes of diverticulitis occurred following protocol amendment.  Two of the patients 
with Grade 3 diverticulitis received additional cycles of study therapy and had no additional 
events (personal communication JD Patel, MD, 11 June 2008).
No hemorrhagic events greater than Grade 3 were reported, and no patients experienced Grade 
3/4 hypertension.  Grade 3 anemia and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia were each reported in 3 (6%) 
patients, and Grade 3 leukopenia was reported in 2 (4%) patients.  Four (8%) patients 
experienced Grade 3 fatigue, and Grade 3 proteinuria and Grade 3 arterial thrombosis were each 
reported in 1 (2%) patient.  Grade 3 venous thrombosis was reported in 2 (4%) patients, and 
Grade 4 was reported in 1 (2%) patient.
Among 49 patients evaluable for response, 1 CR and 23 PRs were observed, for a RR of 49% 
(95% CI:  35% to 61%).  Median time to progression was 7.2 months (31 of 49 patients), and 
median survival was 14.0 months.  In a presentation at the 2008 annual meeting of ASCO, the 
X027 regimen was noted as meriting further investigation in a Phase 3 study (Hanna 2008).
Dalsania and colleagues (2007) reported preliminary results of another nonrandomized, Phase 2 
study in patients with Stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous NSCLC.  Initial therapy consists of 21-day 
cycles of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, carboplatin AUC 6, and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 for up to 6 
cycles.  Patients with CR, PR, or SD continue on maintenance treatment with single-agent 
bevacizumab until disease progression.  Time to progression is the primary objective, and 
secondary objectives include RR, OS, and safety.
At the time of analysis, 19 patients were evaluable for response.  The preliminary RR of 31.6% 
was comparable with the 35% RR reported in Study ECOG 4599 (Sandler et al. 2006).  Survival 
data for this study have not yet been reported.
Safety analysis included all 21 enrolled patients.  Patients received a median of 6.2 cycles (range, 
2 to 23 cycles), and 8 patients proceeded to maintenance bevacizumab.  Grade 3/4 toxicities 
included neutropenia in 7 patients, nausea and vomiting, each in 4 patients, bevacizumab-related 
allergic reaction in 1 patient, and epistaxis in 1 patient.  Five events of Grade 2 proteinuria were 
also reported.  The regimen was not associated with alopecia, neuropathy, arthralgia, or myalgia.
These studies demonstrated that induction therapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin plus 
bevacizumab followed by maintenance pemetrexed and bevacizumab in patients with advanced 
nonsquamous NSCLC is feasible, with an acceptable toxicity profile, and merits further 
investigation in a Phase 3 study.
1.4.3. Phase 2 Study of Bevacizumab in Combination with 

Pemetrexed, Carboplatin, and Enzastaurin

A randomized, double-blind, Phase 2 study (H6Q-MC-S034 [S034]) was ongoing in patients 
with Stage IIIB (with or without effusions) or IV nonsquamous NSCLC.  Treatment in this study 
consisted of four 21-day cycles of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and 
carboplatin AUC 6, all on Day 1, with daily enzastaurin (1125 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1; 500 mg 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 20

each day after Day 1) or placebo.  Patients with CR or PR were to continue with 21-day cycles of 
bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on Day 1, plus daily enzastaurin 500 mg or placebo, until progressive 
disease or unacceptable toxicity.  Forty of the planned 90 patients have been enrolled, and an 
interim analysis of safety was performed after 20 patients had completed 1 cycle of treatment.
Three of the first 40 patients enrolled in this study experienced gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities.  
The first patient, who did not meet eligibility criteria due to perirectal fistula repair four months 
prior to starting the study, was randomized to the Enzastaurin arm and developed perforated 
sigmoid diverticulitis with multiple adjacent abscesses.  The patient subsequently developed a 
bowel stricture requiring stent placement and a GI perforation requiring surgical resection.  This 
patient recovered; the investigator felt the severe diverticulitis, stricture (colon), and colonic 
perforation were related to pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab, but unrelated to blinded 
therapy or protocol procedures.  A second patient, randomized to the placebo arm, had a history 
of diverticulosis and narcotic-related constipation; this patient was treated for severe constipation 
and fecal impaction.  Treatment required admission for oil retention enemas and lactulose.  The 
patient developed worsening abdominal pain and underwent exploratory laparotomy which 
showed sigmoid colon perforation.  The patient underwent a sigmoid resection/Hartman’s pouch 
procedure.  The patient subsequently developed sepsis and expired.  The investigator assessed 
the event of sepsis with the outcome of death as possibly related to bevacizumab, pemetrexed, 
and carboplatin but unrelated to blinded therapy or protocol procedures.  The investigator 
considered the bowel perforation as possibly related to pemetrexed, carboplatin, and 
bevacizumab; but not related to blinded therapy or to protocol procedures.  A third patient, 
randomized to the Enzastaurin arm, with a history of Crohn’s disease, perirectal abscess, and 
bowel resection (many years previously with no active treatment or problems in the last 3 years) 
developed two perirectal abscesses on study.  Although this was considered an adverse event 
(AE), but not a serious adverse event (SAE), the patient was discontinued from the study at the 
investigator's discretion.  No new cases of diverticulitis or bowel perforation were seen in this 
study in patients with no history of diverticular disease.  Treatment arm assignment was not 
considered a factor in these outcomes.
These cases were thoroughly reviewed by the lead investigator of the study, a safety assessment 
committee, and Lilly Global Patient Safety.  Primary recommendations included:  better patient 
selection; increased awareness of GI toxicity and risks by both investigators and patients, with 
both being well instructed relative to the critical importance of prompt follow up relative to early 
signs of GI issues; proactive prevention of constipation; prompt and appropriate work-up for 
patients with abdominal pain using imaging.  Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were not 
recommended because of the increased risk of perforation imposed by instrumentation.
The S034 trial was closed due to futility following an interim analysis conducted after 
40 patients were enrolled.  The external assessment committee identified no undue safety 
concerns between the two treatment arms but that there were more toxicities seen in the 
enzastaurin arm.

1.4.4. Bevacizumab Safety Profile
In the initial Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, 4 potential bevacizumab-associated safety signals were 
identified:  hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events (TEs), and hemorrhage.  
Additional completed Phase 2 and 3 studies of bevacizumab and spontaneous reports have 
further defined the safety profile of this agent.  Bevacizumab-associated adverse events 
identified in Phase 3 trials include congestive heart failure (primarily in metastatic breast cancer), 
gastrointestinal perforations, wound-healing complications, and arterial TEs (Genentech 2007).
Hypertension:  An increased incidence of hypertension has been observed in patients treated 
with bevacizumab.  Grade 4 and 5 hypertensive events are rare.  Clinical sequelae of 
hypertension are rare but have included hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and 
reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS; see details below) (Glusker et al. 
2006; Ozcan et al. 2006).
There is no information on the effect of bevacizumab in patients with uncontrolled hypertension 
at the time of initiating bevacizumab therapy.  Therefore, caution should be exercised before 
initiating bevacizumab therapy in these patients.  Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended 
during bevacizumab therapy.  Optimal control of blood pressure according to standard public 
health guidelines is recommended for patients on treatment with or without bevacizumab.
Temporary interruption of bevacizumab therapy is recommended in patients with hypertension 
requiring medical therapy until adequate control is achieved.  If hypertension cannot be 
controlled to  150/100 mm Hg with medical therapy, bevacizumab therapy should be 
permanently discontinued.  Bevacizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients who 
develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome:  There have been rare reports of 
bevacizumab-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are consistent with RPLS, a 
rare neurologic disorder that can present with the following signs and symptoms (among others):  
seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or 
without associated hypertension.  Brain imaging is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of RPLS.  
In patients who develop RPLS, treatment of specific symptoms, including control of 
hypertension, is recommended along with discontinuation of bevacizumab.  The safety of 
reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously experiencing RPLS is not known 
(Glusker et al. 2006; Ozcan et al. 2006).
Proteinuria:  An increased incidence of proteinuria has been observed in patients treated with 
bevacizumab compared with control arm patients.  In the bevacizumab-containing treatment 
arms of clinical trials (across all indications), the incidence of proteinuria (reported as an AE) 
was up to 38%.  The severity of proteinuria has ranged from asymptomatic and transient events 
detected on routine dipstick urinalysis to nephrotic syndrome; the majority of proteinuria events 
have been Grade 1.  Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in up to 3% of bevacizumab-treated 
patients, and Grade 4 was reported in up to 1.4% of bevacizumab-treated patients.  The 
proteinuria seen in bevacizumab clinical trials was not associated with renal impairment and 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 22

rarely required discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy.  Bevacizumab should be discontinued in 
patients who develop Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome).
Patients with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk for the development of 
proteinuria when treated with bevacizumab.  There is evidence from the dose-finding Phase 2 
studies suggesting that Grade 1 proteinuria may be related to bevacizumab dose.
Proteinuria will be monitored at every cycle.  In patients with Grade 3 proteinuria, bevacizumab 
should be omitted until resolved to  Grade 2.  Bevacizumab should be discontinued for patients 
with Grade 4 proteinuria.
Thromboembolic (TE) events:  Both venous and arterial TE events, ranging in severity from 
catheter-associated phlebitis to fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with 
bevacizumab in the CRC trials and, to a lesser extent, in patients treated with bevacizumab in 
NSCLC and breast cancer trials.
Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and 
thrombophlebitis):  The incidence of  Grade 3 venous TE events in Study ECOG 4599 was 
higher in the bevacizumab-containing arm compared with the chemotherapy control arm (5.6% 
versus 3.2%).  One event (0.2%) was fatal in the bevacizumab-containing arm; nonfatal events 
were reported in the carboplatin/paclitaxel arm.  In clinical trials across all indications the overall 
incidence of venous TE events was 2.8% to 17.3% in the bevacizumab-containing arms 
compared with 3.2% to 15.6% in the chemotherapy control arms.  The use of bevacizumab with 
chemotherapy does not substantially increase the risk of venous TE event compared with 
chemotherapy alone.
See Table JMHD.5 for management of bevacizumab dosing in patients on full-dose 
anticoagulants for treatment of Grade 3 or 4 venous thrombosis.
Arterial TE events:  An increased incidence of arterial TE events was observed in patients 
treated with bevacizumab compared with those receiving control treatment.  Arterial TE events 
include cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and 
other arterial TE events.  Bevacizumab should be discontinued for patients experiencing any 
grade of arterial TE events.
In a pooled analysis of data from 5 randomized Phase 2 and 3 trials (in metastatic CRC, locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC, and metastatic breast cancer), the incidence rate of arterial TE 
events was 3.8% (37 of 963) in patients who received chemotherapy + bevacizumab compared 
with 1.7% (13 of 782) in patients treated with chemotherapy alone.  Arterial TE events led to a 
fatal outcome in 0.8% (8 of 963) of patients treated with chemotherapy + bevacizumab and 0.5% 
of patients with chemotherapy alone.  Cerebrovascular accidents (including TIAs) occurred in 
2.3% of patients treated with chemotherapy + bevacizumab and 0.5% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone.  Myocardial infarction occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy + bevacizumab compared with 0.7% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone.
Aspirin is a standard therapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of arterial TEs in patients at 
high risk of such events, and the use of aspirin  325 mg daily was allowed in the 5 randomized 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 23

studies discussed above.  Use of aspirin was assessed routinely as a baseline or concomitant 
medication in these trials, though safety analyses specifically regarding aspirin use were not 
preplanned.  Because the number of aspirin users and the number of arterial TEs were relatively 
small, retrospective analyses of the ability of aspirin to affect the risk of such events were 
inconclusive.  However, similarly retrospective analyses suggested that the use of up to 325 mg 
of aspirin daily does not increase the risk of Grade 1/2 or 3/4 bleeding events, and similar data 
with respect to metastatic CRC patients have been reported (Hambleton et al. 2005).  Further 
analyses of the effects of concomitant use of bevacizumab and aspirin are ongoing.
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation:  Patients with metastatic carcinoma may be at increased risk 
for the development of GI perforation when treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.  
Bevacizumab should be discontinued in patients who develop GI perforation.  No causal 
association between bevacizumab and intra-abdominal inflammatory process or GI perforation 
has been established.  Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when treating patients with 
intra-abdominal inflammatory processes with bevacizumab (see Section 5.7.6, Recommended 
Bowel Program).  GI perforation has been reported in trials of CRC, NSCLC, and ovarian, renal 
cell, pancreatic, and breast cancer and may be higher in incidence in some tumor types.
Fistula:  Bevacizumab use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae including events 
resulting in death.  Fistulae in the GI track are common (incidence, 1% to 10%) in patients with 
metastatic CRC, but uncommon (0.1% to 1%) or rare (0.01 to 0.1%) in other indications.  In 
addition, tracheoesophageal, brochopleural, urogenital, and biliary fistulae have been reported 
uncommonly (0.1% to 1%) in patients receiving bevacizumab in clinical studies and 
postmarketing reports.  Events were reported at various time points during treatment, ranging 
from 1 week to > 1 year following initiation of bevacizumab, with most events occurring within 
the first 6 months of therapy.
Bevacizumab should be discontinued in patients with tracheoesophageal fistulae or any Grade 4 
fistula.  Limited information is available on the continued use of bevacizumab in patients with 
other fistulae.  In cases of internal fistula not arising in the GI tract, discontinuation of 
bevacizumab should be considered.  (See Section 5.7.6, Recommended Bowel Program.)
Wound-healing complications:  Wound-healing complications, such as wound dehiscence, 
have been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab.  In an analysis of pooled data from 2 trials 
in metastatic CRC, patients undergoing surgery 28 to 60 days before the study treatment with 5-
fluorouracil/leucovorin + bevacizumab did not appear to have an increased risk of wound-
healing complications compared with patients treated with chemotherapy alone (Scappaticci et 
al. 2005).  Surgery in patients currently receiving bevacizumab is not recommended.  No 
definitive data are available to determine a safe interval after bevacizumab exposure with respect 
to wound-healing risk in patients receiving elective surgery; however, the estimated half-life of 
bevacizumab is 21 days.  Bevacizumab should be discontinued in patients with wound-healing 
complications requiring medical intervention (bevacizumab package insert, 2008).
If patients receiving bevacizumab require elective major surgery, bevacizumab should be held 
for 4 to 8 weeks prior to the surgical procedure.  Patients undergoing a major surgical procedure 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 24

should not begin or restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that procedure.  In the case of high-
risk procedures such as liver resection, thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, chemotherapy should be 
restarted no earlier than 6 weeks after surgery and bevacizumab should be restarted no earlier 
than 8 weeks after surgery.
Hemorrhage:  Overall, Grade 3 and 4 bleeding events were observed in 4.0% of 1132 patients 
treated with bevacizumab in a pooled database from 8 Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials in multiple 
tumor types.  The hemorrhagic events that have been observed in bevacizumab clinical studies 
were predominantly tumor-associated hemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage.  Bevacizumab should be discontinued in patients with serious hemorrhage (that is, 
requiring medical intervention) and aggressive medical management should be initiated 
(bevacizumab package insert, 2008).
Tumor-associated hemorrhage:  Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage or hemoptysis has 
been observed primarily in patients with NSCLC.  Life-threatening and fatal hemoptysis was 
identified as a bevacizumab-related AE in NSCLC studies.  These events occurred suddenly and 
presented as major or massive hemoptysis.  Among the possible risk factors evaluated (including 
squamous cell histology, treatment with antirheumatic/anti-inflammatory drugs, treatment with 
anticoagulants, prior radiotherapy, bevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of 
atherosclerosis, central tumor location, and cavitation of tumors during therapy), the only 
variables that showed statistically significant correlations with bleeding were bevacizumab 
therapy and squamous cell histology.
Of patients experiencing pulmonary hemorrhages requiring medical intervention, many had 
cavitation and/or necrosis of the tumor, either preexisting or developing during bevacizumab 
therapy.  Patients developing lung cavitation on treatment should be assessed by the treating 
physician for benefit-risk analysis.
In Study ECOG 4599, in which squamous cell carcinoma was excluded, the rate of any type of 
Grade  3 hemorrhage was 1.0% in the carboplatin-paclitaxel arm versus 4.1% in the 
bevacizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (Sandler et al. 2006).
GI hemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melena, have been reported in patients with CRC, 
and have been assessed as tumor-associated hemorrhages.
Tumor-associated hemorrhage was also seen rarely in other tumor types and locations, including 
central nervous system (CNS) bleeding in a patient with hepatoma with occult CNS metastases 
and continuous oozing of blood from a thigh sarcoma with necrosis (Gordon et al. 2001).
Mucocutaneous hemorrhage:  Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage has been seen in 20% to 40% of patients treated with bevacizumab.  These were 
most commonly Grade 1 epistaxis that lasted less than 5 minutes, resolved without medical 
intervention, and did not require any changes in bevacizumab treatment regimen.
Other hemorrhage:  Minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage in other locations, such as gingival 
bleeding and vaginal bleeding, have also been reported.

Congestive heart failure (CHF):  In clinical trials, CHF was observed in all cancer indications 
studied to date, but predominantly in patients with metastatic breast cancer.  In a Phase 3 study in 
metastatic breast cancer, 7 (3%) bevacizumab-treated patients experienced CHF, compared with 
2 (1%) control arm patients.  These events varied in severity from asymptomatic declines in left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to symptomatic CHF requiring hospitalization and 
treatment.  All patients treated with bevacizumab were previously treated with anthracyclines 
(doxorubicin cumulative dose of 240 to 360 mg/m2).  Many of these patients also had prior 
radiotherapy to the left chest wall.  Most of these patients showed improved symptoms and/or 
left ventricular function following appropriate medical therapy (Miller et al. 2005).
In a randomized, Phase 3 trial of patients with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer, the 
incidence of LVEF decrease (defined as Grade 3 or 4) in the paclitaxel-bevacizumab arm was 
0.3% versus 0% for the paclitaxel-only arm.
No information is available on patients with preexisting CHF of New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) Class II, III, or IV at the time of initiating bevacizumab therapy, as these patients were 
excluded from clinical trials.
Prior anthracyclines exposure and/or prior radiotherapy to the chest wall may be possible risk 
factors for the development of CHF.  Caution should be exercised before initiating bevacizumab 
therapy in patients with these risk factors.
A Phase 2 trial in patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia reported 5 cases of 
cardiac dysfunction (CHF or LVEF decreased to < 40%) among 48 patients treated with 
sequential cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and bevacizumab.  All but 1 of these patients had significant 
prior exposure to anthracyclines as well (Karp et al. 2004).
Other studies in patients with various tumor types and either a history of anthracycline exposure 
or concomitant use with bevacizumab are ongoing.  Patients receiving concomitant 
anthracyclines or with prior exposure to anthracyclines should have a baseline MUGA scan or 
echocardiogram with a normal LVEF.
More detailed information about the known benefits and risks of bevacizumab may be found in 
the investigator's brochure (Genentech 2007).
1.5. Rationale for Study JMHD
Studies have demonstrated that pemetrexed is efficacious in the second- and first-line treatment 
of NSCLC, is superior to gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of 
nonsquamous NSCLC, and is efficacious in the maintenance setting.  Moreover, because of the 
superior efficacy compared with the gemcitabine doublet in nonsquamous histology NSCLC, the 
combination of pemetrexed-carboplatin and bevacizumab should now be compared with the 
standard of care in nonsquamous advanced-stage NSCLC, paclitaxel-carboplatin and 
bevacizumab.  Addition of the targeted-agent bevacizumab is intended to improve patient 
outcomes without significantly increasing toxicity.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 26

The experimental and control arms for Study JMHD were selected as an appropriate study design 
to demonstrate superiority of pemetrexed-carboplatin-bevacizumab, with pemetrexed and 
bevacizumab continued until disease progression (Arm A), compared with paclitaxel-
carboplatin-bevacizumab, with bevacizumab continued until disease progression (Arm B).
In Study JMHD, patients with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC will be randomized to receive 
first-line treatment for 4 cycles or until progression.  Patients who demonstrate CR, PR, or SD 
will go on to maintenance therapy.  This superiority study is a US registration trial.

Investigational Plan

3.1. Summary of Study Design
Study JMHD is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial.  Eligible patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatment arms:

 Arm A - Pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab followed by pemetrexed and 

bevacizumab (450 patients)

 Arm B - Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab (450 

patients).

Patients randomized to Arm A will receive folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone as stated 
in the pemetrexed label.  Before administration of paclitaxel, patients randomized to Arm B will 
receive premedication (dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine or ranitidine) as 
recommended in the paclitaxel label.
Blood samples for PK evaluation will be obtained from 20 patients on Arm A and 20 patients on 
Arm B.  Samples will be obtained in Cycle 1, as shown in Protocol Appendix 7.
Randomization will be stratified by the following factors:



disease stage (IIIB with pleural effusions versus IV) 
(see Exclusion Criterion [13])

 measurable versus nonmeasurable disease
 ECOG performance status (0 versus 1)


sex (male versus female).

3.1.1. Study Completion and End of Trial
This study will be considered complete following the final analysis of OS, after the prespecified 
number of OS events.
The term “end of trial” refers to the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure for the last 
patient in the extension period (see Appendix 10).

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 31

3.1.2. Extension Period
All patients who are still receiving study treatment at the time of study completion (see Section 
3.1.1) may continue to receive study treatment in the extension period until one of the criteria for 
discontinuation is met (see Section 4.3.1).  For all patients who continue to receive study 
treatment during the extension period, a follow-up visit will occur approximately 30 days after 
discontinuation from study treatment (see Section 6.3.1.2).  Figure JMHD.2 provides an 
illustration of study completion, the extension period, and the end of trial.  Lilly or its designee 
will notify investigators when the extension period begins and ends.  Patients must sign a new 
informed consent document (ICD) before entering the extension period.

Study completion, extension period, and end of trial.

3.2. Discussion of Design and Control
Study JMHD is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial in patients with advanced, 
nonsquamous NSCLC (Stage IIIB with pleural effusions or Stage IV).
The three Phase 3 studies, JMEI, JMDB, and JMEN, showed consistent evidence suggesting an 
efficacy advantage for pemetrexed in patients with nonsquamous histology NSCLC (Peterson et 
al. 2007; Ciuleanu et al. 2008; Scagliotti et al. 2008).  Because of this evidence, and because of 
the relationship between bevacizumab treatment and serious hemorrhagic events in patients with 
squamous NSCLC (Johnson et al. 2004), patients with squamous cell histology are excluded 
from Study JMHD.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 32

Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatment arms:

 Arm A - Pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab followed by pemetrexed and 

bevacizumab (450 patients)

 Arm B - Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab (450 

patients).

The study drugs and doses chosen for this study are also the same as those used in Studies X027 
(Arm A) and ECOG 4599 (Arm B).  The regimens for Arm A and Arm B were selected as an 
appropriate study design to demonstrate superiority in OS of pemetrexed-carboplatin-
bevacizumab compared with paclitaxel-carboplatin-bevacizumab.  Treatment will consist of up 
to 4 cycles of induction therapy followed by maintenance therapy until disease progression or 
treatment discontinuation.  A maximum of 4 cycles of induction therapy was chosen based on 
recent reviews and meta-analyses showing this as the optimal duration of initial, platinum-based 
therapy (see Section 1.2).

be completed at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Patients must have 
recovered from the acute toxic effects prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Patients with 
a prior history of NSCLC who have been treated with radiation therapy to the 
chest are not eligible.  See Exclusion Criterion [15] for guidelines regarding 
prior radiotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases.

contraceptive method (for example, intrauterine device, birth control pills, or 
barrier device) during and for 3 months after discontinuation of study 
treatment.

[10] women with childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine 

pregnancy test within 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1; local laboratory results 
must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test performed by the central 
laboratory.  Patients are considered not of childbearing potential if:

[14] have predominantly squamous cell histology NSCLC.  Mixed tumors will be 
categorized by the predominant cell type; if small cell elements are present, 
the patient is ineligible.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 35

[15] have known central nervous system (CNS) disease, other than stable, treated 

brain metastasis.  Stable, treated brain metastasis is defined as metastasis 
having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no 
ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical 
examination and post-treatment brain imaging (computed tomography [CT] 
scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) at baseline.  Patients should be 
off corticosteroids for 1 week (7 days) at the time of the post-treatment brain 
CT/MRI.  Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed.  Treatment for brain 
metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery (Gamma 
Knife, linear particle accelerator, or equivalent), or a combination, as 
deemed appropriate by the treating physician, and must have been completed 
> 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.  During study therapy, patients with stable, 
treated brain metastasis will be monitored every 2 cycles using the same 
modality (MRI or CT scan) that was used at baseline.  Patients with CNS 
metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed 
within 8 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 will be excluded.

[16] had a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, open pleurodesis, or significant 

traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 or have an 
anticipated need for major surgery during the study.

[17] had a core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of 

vascular access device, closed pleurodesis, thoracentesis, and 
mediastinoscopy, within 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.

[18] have a history of gastrointestinal fistula, perforation, or abscess, inflammatory 

bowel disease, or diverticulitis.

[19] are currently receiving ongoing treatment with full-dose warfarin or 

equivalent (that is, unfractionated and/or low molecular weight heparin).

[20] have significant vascular disease (such as, aortic aneurysm requiring surgical 
repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1 
of Cycle 1.

[21] have evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy (in the absence of 

therapeutic anticoagulation).

[22] have a serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction, angina, or 

heart disease, as defined by the New York Heart Association Class II, III, or 
IV, within 6 months prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 (AHA 1994).

[23] have inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure 

> 150 and/or diastolic > 100 mm Hg on antihypertensive medications).

[24] have any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.
[25] have a serious, nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 36

[26] have another active malignancy, other than superficial basal cell and 

superficial squamous (skin) cell, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within the 
last 5 years.

[27] have received treatment within the last 30 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 with 

any drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the 
time of study entry.

[28] have previously received treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, pemetrexed, 

or bevacizumab (Prior intravitreal administration of bevacizumab does not 
preclude study participation).
[29] are pregnant or breast-feeding.
[30] have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to

Day 1 of Cycle 1.

[31] have a known sensitivity to any component of paclitaxel, carboplatin, 

pemetrexed, or bevacizumab.

[32] have a history of hemoptysis ( 1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) 

within 3 months prior to randomization.

[33] are unable to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), other than an aspirin dose  1.3 g per day, for a 5-day period (8-
day period for long-acting agents, such as piroxicam).

[34] are unable or unwilling to take folic acid or vitamin B12 supplementation.
[35] are unable to take corticosteroids.
[36] have a serious concomitant systemic disorder (for example, active infection 
including human immunodeficiency syndrome [HIV]) that, in the opinion of 
the investigator, would compromise the patient’s ability to adhere to the 
protocol.

4.2.1. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates
Exclusion Criteria [13] through [25] and [30] through [36] provide for patient safety.  
Exclusion Criterion [26] helps in maintaining the specificity of the patient population.  Exclusion 
Criterion [27] eliminates drugs that cannot be mapped to a standard drug dictionary, or for which 
little data are known and for which it would not be possible to evaluate the potential relationship 
of AEs or drug interactions.  Exclusion Criterion [28] excludes patients who have already 
received treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, pemetrexed, or bevacizumab, as these patients 
would not likely benefit from re-treatment with these agents.  Exclusion Criterion [29] is 
required because study drugs could have adverse effects on a developing fetus or breast-feeding 
infant.

4.3. Discontinuations

4.3.1. Discontinuation of Patients
The criteria for enrollment must be followed explicitly.  If a patient who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, that patient is discontinued from the study drug, but 
can be allowed to continue in the study in order to provide the follow-up data needed for the 
analysis of the entire intent-to-treat population.  An exception may be granted in rare 
circumstances where the patient has a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no 
effective alternative therapy and, in the opinion of the investigator, is receiving benefit from 
study drug.  In these rare cases, the investigator must obtain documented approval from Lilly to 
allow the patient to continue to receive study drug.
In addition, patients will be discontinued from the study treatment in the following 
circumstances.
 The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn from study treatment.  

If this decision is made because of toxicity, an SAE, or a clinically significant 
laboratory value, all study drugs are to be discontinued and appropriate measures are 
to be taken.  Lilly or its designee is to be alerted immediately.  Refer to Section 6.3, 
Safety Evaluations.

 The patient or attending physician requests that the patient be withdrawn from the 

study.

 The patient, for any reason, requires treatment with another therapeutic agent that has 
been demonstrated to be effective for treatment of the study indication.  In this case, 
discontinuation from study treatment occurs prior to introduction of the new agent.

 The investigator or Lilly, for any reason, stops the study or stops the patient's 

participation in the study.

 The patient has evidence of progressive disease (see Section 1.2).
 The patient becomes pregnant or fails to use adequate birth control (for those patients 

who are able to conceive).

 The patient is noncompliant with study procedures.
 The patient has had 2 dose reductions and experiences an AE that would cause a third 

dose reduction.

o If a study drug is discontinued due to an allergic reaction, the patient should remain 

on study per protocol with discontinuation of only the offending study drug.  See 
Section 5.5.1.

o If bevacizumab is discontinued per protocol rules for an AE, the patient should 

remain on study per protocol with discontinuation of only bevacizumab, see Section 
5.5.1.

Page 38

 The patient cannot receive any study treatment within 42 days after the beginning of 

the previous cycle, unless continuation is approved by Lilly.

4.3.2. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study site participation may be discontinued if Lilly, the investigator, or the ethical review board 
of the study site judges it necessary for any reason.
4.3.3. Discontinuation of the Study
The study will be discontinued if Lilly judges it necessary for sound medical and/or ethical 
reasons.

The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for explaining the correct use of the 
investigational agents to study site personnel and to the patient (or the patient’s legal 
representative), verifying that instructions are followed properly, maintaining accurate records of 
study drug dispensing and collection, and returning all unused medication to Lilly or its designee 
at the end of the trial.
Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a 
complaint or problem with the study drugs so that the situation can be assessed.  
5.2. Materials and Supplies

5.2.1. Pemetrexed – Arm A
For instructions on reconstitution and administration of pemetrexed, refer to the IB (Safe 
Handling and Administration).
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country's local regulatory requirements.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 41

5.2.2. Paclitaxel – Arm B
Paclitaxel will be provided by the investigator.  Paclitaxel is administered by intravenous 
infusion over 3 hours per local practice guidelines.
5.2.3. Carboplatin – Arm A and Arm B
Carboplatin will be provided by the investigator.  Carboplatin is administered after paclitaxel
(Arm B) or pemetrexed (Arm A) by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes with standard 
antiemetics per local practice guidelines.  

Carboplatin dosing, using the Calvert formula, is often based upon a calculated creatinine 
clearance using serum creatinine as a surrogate for renal function.  Several assays are available to 
measure serum creatinine.  In the United States and many parts of the world, most laboratories 
use methods that are standardized against reference material in which the creatinine value has 
been assigned by Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS).  After 31 December 2010, all 
clinical laboratories in the United States will use creatinine methods standardized relative to the 
IDMS reference material.  
The recalibration of serum creatinine measurements against the IDMS reference material may 
result in slight differences in reported serum creatinine levels in the low range of normal.  If the 
total carboplatin dose is calculated based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using 
an IDMS-standardized serum creatinine and the Calvert formula, carboplatin dosing could be 
higher than if the GFR had been directly measured, and could result in increased toxicity.
At sites where creatinine is determined by a method standardized to the IDMS reference 
material, the estimated GFR used in the Calvert formula to calculate area under the curve 
(AUC)-based dosing should not exceed 125 mL/min for patients who have not begun therapy.  
After 31 December 2010, all US sites should calculate carboplatin doses based upon serum 
creatinine values that were measured by the IDMS method.  
The carboplatin dose will be calculated as the target AUC 6, using the Calvert formula (1989):
Calvert Formula
Total Dose (mg) = (target AUC)  (CrCl + 25) 
Maximum carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC 6 (mg•min/mL)  (125 + 25) = 6  150 mL/min 
= 900 mg

5.2.4. Bevacizumab – Arm A and Arm B
Bevacizumab will be provided by the manufacturer, and distributed to investigators by Lilly.  
Bevacizumab is supplied as a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale brown, sterile liquid 
concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion.  Bevacizumab may be supplied in 5-mL (100-
mg) and 20-mL (400-mg) glass vials containing 4 or 16 mL of bevacizumab, respectively (all at 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 42

25 mg/mL).  Vials contain bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20, and Sterile 
Water for Injection, USP.  Vials contain no preservative and are suitable for single use only.
Upon receipt of the study drug, vials are to be refrigerated at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) and 
should remain refrigerated until just prior to use.  DO NOT FREEZE.  DO NOT SHAKE.  Vials 
should be protected from light.
Bevacizumab will be diluted in a total volume of 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 
USP.  Administration will be as a continuous intravenous infusion.  Anaphylaxis precautions 
should be observed during study drug administration (see Section 5.5.1.5).  It is not necessary to 
correct dosing based on ideal weight.
The initial dose will be delivered over 90  15 minutes.  If the first infusion is tolerated without 
infusion-associated AEs (fever and/or chills), the second infusion may be delivered over 60  10 
minutes.  If the 60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered 
over 30  10 minutes.
Opened vials must be used within 8 hours.  VIALS ARE FOR SINGLE USE ONLY.  Vials used 
for 1 patient may not be used for any other patient.  Once bevacizumab has been added to a bag 
of sterile saline, the solution must be administered within 8 hours.
5.2.5. Premedication for Arm A
5.2.5.1. Folic Acid
Investigators will obtain folic acid in 1 of the following forms, with preference in order from 
Option 1 to Option 3:

1)
2)

3)

350 to 600 g folic acid
a multivitamin containing folic acid in the range of 350 to 600 g (acceptable 
only if Option 1 is not available)
a dose of folic acid between 600 and 1000 g (acceptable only if neither 
Option 1 nor Option 2 is available).

For purposes of this study, folic acid must be given at least 5 to 7 days before Cycle 1, Day 1 and 
continuing daily until 3 weeks after discontinuation of pemetrexed.
5.2.5.2. Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 will be prescribed by the investigator and administered as a 1000-g intramuscular 
injection.  A vitamin B12 injection must be administered in the 7-day period prior to Cycle 1, 
Day 1 and should be repeated approximately every 9 weeks until 3 weeks after discontinuation 
of pemetrexed.
5.2.5.3. Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone 4 mg (or an equivalent corticosteroid and dose) will be given orally twice per 
day on the day before, the day of, and the day after each dose of pemetrexed.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 43

5.2.6. Premedication for Arm B
Study site personnel will administer premedication as indicated in the paclitaxel label.  Such 
premedication may consist of:  (1) dexamethasone 20 mg taken by mouth approximately 12 and 
6 hours prior to paclitaxel, (2) diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg administered 
intravenously 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel, and (3) cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 
mg) administered intravenously 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel.
5.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
Patients who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B at the 
baseline visit (Visit 0).  Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a 
computer-generated random sequence using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) at a 
central location.  Randomization will be stratified by the following factors:



disease stage (IIIB with pleural effusions versus IV) (see Exclusion Criterion 
[13])

 measurable versus nonmeasurable disease
 ECOG performance status (0 versus 1)


sex (male versus female).

5.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study
The doses of paclitaxel, pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab used in this study are the 
doses approved in the United States for patients with NSCLC. 
5.5. Selection and Timing of Doses
Patients will be randomly assigned to Arm A or Arm B (see Section 3.1).  Study drug will be 
administered as shown in Section 5.1.
5.5.1. Dose Adjustments and Cycle Delays
All toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE guidelines (Version 3.0; NCI 2006).  Any 
patient who requires a dose reduction will continue to receive a reduced dose for the remainder 
of the study.  Any patient with 2 prior dose reductions who experiences a toxicity that would 
cause a third dose reduction must be discontinued from all study treatment.
Discontinuation of study drug typically requires withdrawal from the study.  If an AE occurs 
with bevacizumab, bevacizumab may be discontinued as outlined in Section 5.5.1.5, and the 
other study drugs continued.  In addition, paclitaxel may be discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 
neurotoxicity and the other study drugs continued (see Table JMHD.4).  The only other situation 
allowing discontinuation of study drugs other than bevacizumab that allows a patient to stay on 
study therapy is an allergic reaction, in which case the patient should remain on study per 
protocol with discontinuation of only the offending study drug.

5.5.1.1. Carboplatin Toxicity and Dose Reductions
For patients who have started therapy regardless of method of serum creatinine measurement 
who:


have already received >900 mg carboplatin, and who are not experiencing Grade 3/4 
toxicity that an investigator would reasonably attribute to carboplatin, that patient should 
continue on his/her current dose of carboplatin.  
have experienced Grade 3/4 toxicity attributed to carboplatin, that patient should have all 
study drugs reduced per protocol.  

o If this dose reduction does not result in a carboplatin dose <900 mg, the 

carboplatin dose should be further reduced to 900 mg.  





have already undergone a dose reduction and the carboplatin dose remains >900 mg, and 
that patient has already received subsequent treatment at this lower dose without Grade 
3/4 toxicity, that patient should continue on his/her current dose of carboplatin.

5.5.1.2. Hematologic Toxicity
At the start of each cycle, ANC must be  1.5  109/L and platelet count must be  100  109/L.  
Treatment should be delayed for up to 42 days to allow sufficient time for recovery.
Upon recovery, dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle will be based on the lowest 
platelet and neutrophil values from the previous cycle (see Table JMHD.3).

5.5.1.3. Creatinine Clearance
Creatinine clearance will be estimated using the original, weight-based Cockcroft and Gault 
formula (1976; see Appendix 6) or measured using the appropriate radiolabeled method 
(51-CrEDTA or Tc99m-DTPA) to determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  The method of 
CrCl assessment used at baseline should be used throughout the study.  Enrollment and dosing 
decisions based on CrCl may be made using locally determined clinical laboratory results 
(calculated using the original, weight-based Cockcroft and Gault formula).  The serum creatinine 
must be assayed at the same local lab each time for that patient.  If a local lab is being used to 
monitor a patient’s renal function, the central laboratory sample still must be drawn for safety 
analysis.  See Section 5.2.3 for details regarding the measurement of serum creatinine to 
calculate the carboplatin dose.
Creatinine clearance should be  45 mL/min before the start of any cycle.  The cycle may be 
delayed for up to 42 days to allow the patient time to recover from the toxicity.  If CrCl has not 
returned to  45 mL/min within 42 days after the previous dose, the patient must be discontinued 
from all study drugs unless continuation is approved by the Lilly clinical research physician.
5.5.1.4. Nonhematologic Toxicity
For Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities, treatment should be delayed until resolution to less 
than or equal to the patient’s baseline value.  Dose reductions at the start of the subsequent cycle 
will be based on nonhematologic toxicities from the dose administered in the preceding cycle.
Table JMHD.4 provides the relevant dose adjustments for nonhematologic toxicities.

5.5.1.5. Treatment Delays due to Insufficient Folic Acid or Vitamin B12 

Supplementation – Arm A

For patients receiving pemetrexed (Arm A), do not start Cycle 1 until both of the following 
requirements are met:

1. The patient has taken folic acid for at least 5 days immediately preceding the first 

dose of pemetrexed.

2. The patient has received a vitamin B12 injection once within 7 days immediately 

preceding the first dose of pemetrexed.

Delay subsequent cycles until the patient has taken folic acid for at least 14 of the 21 days before 
Day 1 of the cycle.
5.5.1.6. Bevacizumab – Arm A and Arm B
There are no reductions in the bevacizumab dose.  If AEs that require omitting bevacizumab 
occur, the dose will remain the same once treatment resumes.
Any toxicities associated or possibly associated with bevacizumab treatment should be managed 
according to standard medical practice.  Omission of bevacizumab will have no immediate 
therapeutic effect.  Bevacizumab has a terminal half-life of 21 days; therefore, its omission 
results in slow elimination over several months.  There is no available antidote for bevacizumab.
Patients should be clinically assessed for toxicity before, during, and after each infusion of 
bevacizumab.  If unmanageable toxicity occurs because of bevacizumab at any time during the 
study, treatment with bevacizumab should be permanently discontinued, however the patient 
may remain on study.
Infusion reaction:  Infusion of bevacizumab should be interrupted for patients who develop 
dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension.  Patients who experience CTCAE (Version 3.0) 
Grade 3 or 4 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, or adult respiratory distress syndrome, or any 
grade bronchospasm will be discontinued from bevacizumab treatment.
If a patient experiences an infusion-associated AE, he or she may be premedicated for the next 
study drug infusion; however, the infusion time may not be decreased for the subsequent 
infusion.  If the next infusion is well tolerated with premedication, the subsequent infusion time 
may then be decreased by 30  10 minutes as long as the patient continues to be premedicated.  
If a patient experiences an infusion-associated AE with the 60-minute infusion, all subsequent 
doses should be given over 90  15 minutes.  Similarly, if a patient experiences an infusion-
associated AE with the 30-minute infusion, all subsequent doses should be given over 60  10 
minutes.  Infusion time should not be extended beyond  90  15 minutes.
Adverse events requiring delays or permanent discontinuation of bevacizumab are listed in Table 
JMHD.5.
Regardless of the reason for omitting bevacizumab treatment, the maximum allowable length of 
bevacizumab treatment interruption is 42 days.

5.6. Blinding
This is an open-label study.  Each patient will be aware of his or her own assigned treatment 
group.  At each investigative site, all staff involved in treating and caring for study patients will 
have full knowledge of treatment assignments for the patients under their care.
For the accumulated aggregate database, treatment assignment will not be included, and other 
parameters that can disclose treatment assignment will be scrambled.  Therefore, the sponsor and 
all investigative sites will remain blinded to treatment group assignments for the aggregate 
database until the database lock for the final analysis.
Four planned interim analyses will be conducted for this study (see Section 8.2.12).  Only the 
Statistical Analysis Center (SAC) and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), both external to 
Lilly, will have access to unblinded or partially unblinded interim data for these formal interim 
analyses, unless an internal review is needed in order for Lilly to make an informed decision 
based on a DMC recommendation to stop or modify the study.  In that case, the individuals 
involved in the internal review may also view the unblinded or partially unblinded interim data.  
Study sites will not receive any information about interim data unless investigators need to know 
this information for the safety of their patients.

5.7. Concomitant Therapy
Patients are allowed to receive full supportive care therapies concomitantly during the study.  No 
other anticancer therapy, immunotherapy, hormonal cancer therapy, radiation therapy, surgery 
for cancer, or experimental medications will be permitted while the patients are participating in 
this study.  Any disease progression requiring other forms of specific antitumor therapy will be 
cause for early discontinuation of study therapy.  The following concomitant therapies warrant 
special attention.
5.7.1. Clinically Significant Effusions
If a patient develops clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions (as determined on the 
basis of symptoms or clinical examination) prior to the first dose of study treatment or during 
therapy, draining the effusion prior to dosing is required.  However, if the investigator 
determines that the effusion represents disease progression, the patient should be discontinued 
from study treatment.
5.7.2. Colony-Stimulating Factors
Routine use of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) is not permitted.  American Society of Clinical 
Oncology guidelines for use of CSFs should be followed (Smith et al. 2006).
5.7.2.1. Use of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents
According to NCCN guidelines (Rodgers et al. 2008), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) 
are not indicated for treatment of cancer-related anemia in patients with solid tumors.  
Erythropoietic therapy may be considered for treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia for a 
hemoglobin < 10 g/dL after the patient has been counseled about the risks and benefits of ESA 
use.
Because recommendations on the use of ESAs are rapidly evolving, investigators should 
frequently refer to the NCCN, ASCO, and/or Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services web 
sites for the latest guidelines.
5.7.3. Leucovorin
Leucovorin is allowed:  (1) for treatment of CTCAE Grade 4 leukopenia or Grade 4 neutropenia 
lasting more than 3 days, beginning on the third day of Grade 4 myelosuppression; or (2) 
immediately, for treatment of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, bleeding associated with Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 or 4 mucositis.
The following doses and schedules are recommended for intravenous use:




leucovorin 100 mg/m2 intravenously once, followed by
leucovorin 50 mg/m2 intravenously every 6 hours for 8 days.

Appropriate doses of the oral formulation may also be used at the investigator’s discretion.

5.7.4. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
Patients taking NSAIDs or salicylates will not take the NSAID or salicylate (other than an 
aspirin dose  1.3 grams per day) for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days after receiving 
pemetrexed.  Patients taking NSAIDs or salicylates with a long half-life (for example, naproxen, 
piroxicam, diflunisal, or nabumetone) will not take the NSAIDs or salicylates for 5 days before, 
the day of, and 2 days after pemetrexed.
5.7.5. Therapy for Diarrhea
In the event of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, doses of pemetrexed and paclitaxel should be 
adjusted as shown in Table JMHD.4, and the following supportive measures are allowed:  
hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.  Bevacizumab may be given without interruption unless 
the investigator considers the diarrhea to also be related to bevacizumab.
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or severe 
(Grade 3 or 4) neutropenia, broad-spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed.  Patients with severe 
diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting must be hospitalized for 
intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances. 
5.7.6. Recommended Bowel Program
Diverticular disease occurs when intralumenal pressure increases in the bowel.  The most 
common part of the bowel affected is the sigmoid colon.  Diverticulitis occurs when diverticuli 
become inflamed or infected, a situation that is more likely to occur if a patient is constipated.  
Constipation in patients with advanced-stage lung cancer is common because many of these 
patients require narcotic therapy for pain management of metastatic sites.  To decrease the risk of 
constipation, especially in patients with diverticulosis, a bowel program is recommended for all 
patients with any evidence of constipation.
Patients with diverticulosis are more likely to develop diverticulitis when severely constipated or 
impacted because of the increase in intralumenal pressure.  Enemas and manual disimpaction 
may further increase intralumenal pressure.  This may increase the risk of abscess, perforation, 
and fistula independent of chemotherapy.  Because bevacizumab is associated with a risk of 
bowel perforation, prevention and proactive management of constipation may increase patient 
safety.
The following measures are recommended:





diet high in fiber and water.  Fiber may be obtained in the diet and through 
products such as Benefiber, Metamucil, or Citrucel.
stool softeners.

LY231514

Page 54

If the above measures are not adequate to maintain a daily bowel movement, additional measures 
to increase bowel movements to at least every other day may include:

 milk of magnesia

 magnesium citrate.

lactulose

5.7.7. Therapy for Febrile Neutropenia
Patients experiencing febrile neutropenia, especially with diarrhea or dyspnea, should be 
managed in a hospital setting according to standard procedures, with the urgent initiation of 
intravenous antibiotic therapy.
5.8. Treatment Compliance
All study drugs will be administered intravenously at the investigational sites.  As a result, 
patient compliance is ensured.
For patients on Arm A:



In the period before the first dose of study therapy, compliance with folic acid 
supplementation is required and should be documented by the investigative site 
personnel. 

 Vitamin B12 supplementation will be administered as an intramuscular injection 

at the investigational sites.  As a result, patient compliance is ensured.

Sections 5.2.5.1 and 5.2.5.2 provide definitions of sufficient folic acid and vitamin B12 therapy, 
respectively.

6. Efficacy and Health Outcome Measures, Safety 
Evaluations, Sample Collection and Testing, and

Appropriateness of Measurements

Study procedures and their timing (including tolerance limits for timing) are summarized in the 
Study Schedule (Appendix 1) and the Extension Period Schedule (Appendix 10).
6.1. Efficacy Measures
Efficacy assessments are performed until study completion.  During the extension period, 
investigators are responsible for performing any procedures and tests needed for the appropriate 
care of the patient; however, the results of efficacy assessments performed during the extension 
period will not be reported on the case report form (CRF).
Sites will assess tumor response in patients by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Therasse et al. 2000; Appendix 4).
Baseline tumor measurements will be performed within 4 weeks before enrollment.  Computed 
tomography including spiral CT, scans and MRI are the preferred methods of measurement, but 
chest x-ray is acceptable for clearly defined lesions surrounded by aerated lung.  In addition, a 
physical examination will be performed within 2 weeks before enrollment for measurement of 
palpable tumor lesions.  Ultrasound and positron emission tomography scans are not permitted as 
methods of tumor measurement.
The same method used at baseline, covering the same anatomy, must be used consistently for 
tumor assessment throughout the study.  During study therapy, tumor assessment will be 
repeated every 2 cycles ( 2 weeks).  For responding patients, response must be confirmed as 
described in Section 6.1.1.1.
If a patient has PD, he or she will be discontinued from study therapy.  If a patient discontinues 
from study therapy and has not had disease progression, tumor measurements will also be 
performed at the 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up visit (see Figure JMHD.3) and every 6 
weeks ( 2 weeks) thereafter.  Once the patient has objective disease progression, the patient will 
be followed every 90 days ( 14 days).
Until study completion, the following postdiscontinuation data will be reported on the CRF:  the 
date of disease progression; documentation of any anticancer treatment patient has received, 
including the dates of any postdiscontinuation systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or surgical 
intervention; and the date of death.  For patients who discontinue from study therapy before 
study completion, postdiscontinuation follow up will continue until the earliest of the following 
events:  death, lost to follow up, or study completion.
6.1.1. Efficacy Criteria for Tumor Response
Tumor responses will be measured and recorded by using RECIST guidelines (Therasse et al. 
2000; Appendix 4).  During the extension period, patients should be assessed according to good 
clinical practice requirements to ensure continued eligibility to receive study treatment.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 56

6.1.1.1. Best Response
Best response is determined from the sequence of cycle responses assessed.  For complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR), best response must be confirmed.  A second assessment 
should be performed 28 to 42 days after the first documentation of response.  Thereafter, a 
responding patient will be followed every 6 weeks ( 2 weeks) per the Study Schedule 
(Appendix 1).  Two objective status determinations of CR before progression are required for a 
best response of CR.  Two determinations of PR or better before progression, but not qualifying 
for a CR, are required for a best response of PR.  Best response of SD is defined as disease that 
does not meet the criteria for CR, PR, or PD and has been evaluated at least 1 time, at least 
6 weeks after baseline assessment.
6.1.2. Definition of Efficacy Measures
The following definitions for time-to-event measures will apply:
Overall survival (OS):  Duration is measured from the date of randomization to the date of 
death from any cause.  If a patient has not died at the time of the data inclusion cutoff date for the 
analysis, OS will be censored at the last date the patient was known by the treating physician to 
still be alive.
Progression-free survival (PFS):  Duration is measured from the date of randomization to the 
date of objective progression of disease or the date of death from any cause, whichever is earlier.  
For patients who receive subsequent systemic anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the 
study chemotherapy) prior to objective progression or death, PFS will be censored at the date of 
the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to starting the subsequent systemic 
anticancer therapy.  For patients not known to have died as of the data inclusion cutoff date and 
who do not have objective progressive disease, PFS will be censored at the date of the last 
objective progression-free disease assessment prior to the cutoff date or the date of initiation of 
subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
Time to progressive disease (TTPD):  Time is measured from the date of randomization to the 
first date of objective progression of disease.  For patients who receive subsequent systemic 
anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study chemotherapy) prior to objective 
progression, TTPD will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease 
assessment prior to starting this subsequent systemic anticancer therapy.  For patients not known 
to have had objective progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cutoff date for a particular 
analysis, or who have died without objective progression of disease, TTPD will be censored at 
the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to that cutoff date or the 
date of initiation of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
6.2. Health Outcome Measures
Previous studies have demonstrated the potential for increased toxicity when treatment regimens 
that combine multiple chemotherapeutic agents are used.  It therefore becomes important to 
include PRO measures as endpoints in Phase 3 trials where combination therapies are used, 
especially in the advanced NSCLC setting, where treatment is only palliative.  In Study JMHD, 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 57

toxicities will be assessed using CTCAE (Version 3.0 [NCI 2006]) and through the use of 
patient-administered FACT questionnaires (see Appendix 8).
The FACT questionnaires used in this study are designed to capture the patient’s assessment of 
his or her overall QOL, patient-reported side effects, and disease- and treatment-related 
symptoms.  PRO instruments that mainly capture the effect of treatment on disease-related 
symptoms will not be effective in assessing treatment-related side effects.  Thus, multiple 
instruments should be used, especially because patients can simultaneously report both an 
improvement of disease-related symptoms and a worsening of treatment-related side effects.  
Use of FACT questionnaires will enable assessment of the differences between treatment arms 
with respect to overall QOL and changes in QOL brought about by symptom 
worsening/alleviation and treatment toxicity.
Study JMHD will use the FACT-General (FACT-G) questionnaire, plus the lung cancer and 
neurotoxicity subscales.  Collectively, the instruments used in this study are referred to as the 
FACT-L/Ntx questionnaire.
Speculated differences in the safety profiles of the 2 treatment arms include the incidence and 
severity of peripheral neuropathy, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and nausea.  The FACT-L/Ntx 
will provide supplemental assessment of these toxicities from the patient’s perspective and 
explore the relationship of the toxicity to the PRO.  This is especially important for peripheral 
neuropathy (a common side effect of taxane therapy), as it has been shown to be under-reported 
when assessed using CTCAE compared with patient-reported measurement (Morton et al. 2005).  
Fatigue and nausea (common side effects of pemetrexed therapy) will be captured via CTCAE 
assessment and the FACT physical well-being subscale.
6.2.1. FACT-G
The FACT-G is a reliable and valid instrument used to measure QOL in patients with cancer 
(Cella at al. 1993).  The 27-item questionnaire is organized into subscales, each designed to 
assess a QOL domain:






physical well-being (PWB) – 7 items
social/family well-being (SWB) – 7 items
emotional well-being (EWB) – 6 items
functional well-being (FWB) – 7 items.

6.2.2. FACT-Lung
The FACT-Lung (FACT-L) is a reliable and valid instrument consisting of the FACT-G and a 9-
item lung cancer subscale (LCS) and is appropriate for both small cell lung cancer and NSCLC 
(Cella et al. 1995).

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 58

Results of the FACT-L can be reported as:




scores for the 5 individual subscales (PWB, SWB, EWB, FWB, and LCS)
total FACT-L - the sum of the scores of all 5 subscales 
(total FACT-L = PWB + SWB + EWB + FWB + LCS)

 Trial Outcome Index-Lung (TOI-L) – the sum of the PWB and FWB  subscales 

plus the LCS (TOI-L = PWB + FWB + LCS).

6.2.3. FACT/GOG-Ntx
The FACT/GOG-Ntx consists of an 11-item neurotoxicity subscale (Ntx) developed in 
collaboration with the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) for use in patients with 
neurotoxicity.  This instrument possesses strong psychometric properties and is both reliable and 
valid (Calhoun et al. 2003).
Results of the FACT/GOG-Ntx can be reported as:




scores for the 5 individual subscales (PWB, SWB, EWB, FWB, and NTX)
total FACT/GOG-Ntx - the sum of the scores of all 5 subscales
(total FACT-T = PWB + SWB + EWB + FWB + NTX)

 Ntx Trial Outcome Index (TOI-Ntx) - the sum of the PWB and FWB subscales 

plus the NTX (TOI-Ntx = PWB + FWB + NTX).

6.2.4. FACT-L/Ntx Timing and Scoring
Collection of all FACT-L/Ntx data will end at study completion (see Section 3.1.1).
FACT-L/Ntx questionnaires will be completed only by randomized patients for whom a 
validated translation is available in a language in which the completer is fluent.  Each patient 
should complete a questionnaire once at each of the following time points:






at baseline (before randomization)
before each cycle, except Cycle 1
upon discontinuation from all study-drug treatment
during the postdiscontinuation follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug (see Figure JMHD.3).

For each item, the patient makes a selection from a 5-point rating scale, where 0 equals “not at 
all” and 4 equals “very much.”
Patients should fill out the questionnaires at the beginning of each visit, before any extensive 
contact and consultation with the clinician/study investigator.  Consultation with the clinician 
may bias the patient’s perceptions about his or her health-related QOL and thus affect FACT-
L/Ntx assessment.
For questionnaires completed at the beginning of a cycle, the patient’s answers should be based 
on his or her response to treatment in the preceding cycle.  For example, the questionnaire 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 59

completed at the beginning of Cycle 2 describes the patient’s response during Cycle 1 and would 
be labeled as Cycle 1 QOL.
Study JMHD will use the TOI-L and the TOI-Ntx for analyses.  The TOI, which measures the 
physical aspects of QOL, is often used as a single clinical trial outcome index and is considered 
to be the outcome measure that is most sensitive to change when assessing anticancer therapies 
(Cella et al. 1995).
The FACT-L/Ntx will be scored as recommended by the developers.  At least 50% of the items 
within the subscale must be completed for a score to be calculated.  For the FACT-L/Ntx and the 
TOI, all component subscales must be scored and at least 80% of all items must be completed.  
Each subscale and composite score will be considered valid based on these criteria.  For all 
FACT scales and symptom indices, higher scores indicate better QOL.
6.3. Safety Evaluations
Sites will perform safety evaluations as described in this section and the Study Schedule 
(Appendix 1) until study completion.  During the extension period, investigators remain
responsible for performing any procedures and tests needed for the appropriate care of the 
patient; however, only data regarding study drug administration, AEs, and SAEs will be reported 
on the CRF.
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study 
and for alerting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient.
The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patients during the study.
Physical exams, documentation of concomitant medications, ECOG performance status, CTCAE 
grading, and blood chemistry will be performed at the beginning of each cycle during induction 
and maintenance therapy; additional chemistry values may be collected per local practice or at 
the investigator’s discretion.  Hematology will be performed weekly during induction therapy.  
During maintenance therapy, hematology will be performed at the beginning of each cycle; 
additional hematology values may be collected during maintenance therapy per local practice or 
at the investigator’s discretion.  PT/INR will be performed as clinically indicated.  Specific 
details are included in the Study Schedule (Appendix 1).
At baseline, all patients will be assessed by physical examination and brain imaging (CT scan or 
MRI) to determine eligibility.  Randomized patients with stable brain metastasis will be 
monitored every 2 cycles using the same imaging modality that was used at baseline.
Hypertension will be monitored through routine evaluation of blood pressure before each 
bevacizumab treatment.  Optimal control of blood pressure according to standard public health 
guidelines is recommended for patients on treatment with or without bevacizumab.
Proteinuria will be monitored by UPCR or dipstick at every cycle.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 60

Gastrointestinal toxicities will be monitored through interval history with specific targeted 
questions (see Appendix 9) and physical examination.  Patients with evidence of GI toxicity 
should be more thoroughly evaluated by CT or MRI scans and/or by a gastroenterologist to 
assess for diverticulitis, abscess, fistula, or perforation. 
If patients receiving bevacizumab require elective major surgery, bevacizumab should be held 
for 4 to 8 weeks prior to the surgical procedure.  Patients undergoing a major surgical procedure 
should not begin or restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that procedure.  In the case of high-
risk procedures such as liver resection, thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, chemotherapy should be 
restarted no earlier than 6 weeks after surgery and bevacizumab should be restarted no earlier 
than 8 weeks after surgery.
The investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before completing the study.  The 
patient should be followed until the event is resolved or explained.
6.3.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be followed regardless of applicable regulatory 
requirements that may be less stringent.  A clinical trial AE is any untoward medical event 
associated with the use of a drug or drug delivery system in humans, whether or not it is 
considered related to a drug or drug delivery system.
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical trials because the purpose of the clinical trial is to 
establish drug effect.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug or drug 
delivery system should be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast-feeding are collected for 
regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.
Study site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexisting 
conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in 
the study.
During the study, site personnel will record any change in the condition(s) and the occurrence 
and nature of any AEs.
After the informed consent document is signed, all AEs related to protocol procedures are 
reported to Lilly or its designee via CRF.
All AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of study drug must be reported to Lilly 
or its designee via CRF.
Study site personnel will record any daily dosage that exceeds the maximum dosage in the 
protocol or in the relevant reference safety document (for example, clinical dosage section for 
humans in the investigator brochure), whichever is greater, via CRF.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 61

Investigators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, studied disease state, study drug, and/or drug 
delivery system via CRF.
Events leading to the clinical outcome of death due to disease progression will be included as 
part of the safety and efficacy analyses for this study and will not be reported to Lilly or its 
designee as AEs via CRF unless the investigator believes the event may have been caused by the 
study drug or drug delivery system.
Any clinically significant findings from laboratory tests or vital sign measurements that result in 
a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its designee using the CRF.
6.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
SAE collection begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has received study drug.  
If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving study drug, 
the event will NOT be collected unless the investigator feels the event may have been caused by 
a protocol procedure. 
Study site personnel must alert Lilly or its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness of the event via a sponsor-approved method.  An SAE is any adverse event from this 
study that results in one of the following outcomes:









death (excluding death due to progression of study disease, unless related to study 
treatment)
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization
a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
considered significant by the investigator for any other reason.

Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious adverse drug events when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
6.3.1.2. Postdiscontinuation Safety Follow-Up Assessments
For all patients, a follow-up visit will occur approximately 30 days after discontinuation from 
study treatment.  The 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up period begins on the day after the 
patient and the investigator agree to discontinue the patient from the treatment portion of the trial 
and lasts approximately 30 days.  The 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up visit occurs at or 
near the end of the 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up period (see Figure JMHD.3).



After the 30-day postdiscontinuation visit, only SAEs thought to be related to study drug or 
protocol procedures should be reported immediately to Lilly or its designee via the designated 
transmission method and recorded on the CRF.  For these events, the patient must be followed 
every 30 days until the event has resolved, stabilized, or until the initiation of a new anticancer 
systemic therapy.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 63

For patients who discontinue from study treatment during the extension period, 
postdiscontinuation follow-up procedures will be performed as shown in the Extension Period 
Schedule (Appendix 10).  
6.3.2. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly clinical research physician will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study.  
Lilly will review SAEs within time frames mandated by company procedures and will review 
trends, laboratory analytes, and AEs at periodic intervals.
6.3.3. Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical trials 
in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and to facilitate process and 
product improvements.
Complaints related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant drugs/drug delivery systems 
are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package 
insert.
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the following aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance with the instructions provided for this study:







recording a complete description of the product complaint reported and any 
associated AEs using the study-specific complaint forms provided for this purpose
faxing the completed product complaint form within 24 hours to Lilly or its 
designee
determining when a drug/drug delivery system is to be returned for investigation.

6.4. Sample Collection and Testing
Appendix 2 lists the specific tests performed until study completion.  During the extension 
period, investigators are responsible for performing any procedures and tests needed for the 
appropriate care of the patient; however, the results of the procedures and tests will not be 
reported on the CRF.
6.4.1. Samples for Standard Laboratory Testing
Blood and urine samples will be collected at the times specified in the Study Schedule 
(Appendix 1).  Standard laboratory tests, including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, will 
be performed.  A pregnancy test will be performed if applicable.  Other clinical laboratory tests 
will be analyzed by a central or local laboratory.  Appendix 2 lists the specific tests that will be 
performed for this study.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory report.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 64

Samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed within 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to 
comply with applicable laws, regulations, or laboratory certification standards.
6.4.2. Samples for Drug Concentration Measurements 

Pharmacokinetics

Blood samples (4 mL for each drug at each time point) for PK assessment will be collected in 20 
patients in Arm A and 20 patients in Arm B.  Details of the sampling instructions and the 
schedule for blood draws are listed in Appendix 7.  Plasma samples will be assayed for 
bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin (total platinum and free platinum) using validated 
analytical methods.
The times for sampling blood are nominal times; the actual sampling time should be accurately 
recorded for use in the analyses.  Bioanalytical samples collected to measure study drug 
concentration will be retained for a maximum of 1 year following the last patient visit for the 
study.
A total of 35 blood samples per patient will be collected in Arm A (total blood volume 
approximately 140 mL).  A total of 23 blood samples per patient will be collected in Arm B 
(total blood volume approximately 92 mL).
6.4.3. Stored Samples for Translational Research
As part of Lilly’s ongoing efforts to understand the relationship between cancer, genetics, and 
response to therapy, this study will analyze biomarkers relevant to pemetrexed, carboplatin, and 
bevacizumab and to the disease state.  The study will also analyze the correlation between 
biomarkers and clinical outcome.  All sites are required to participate in this translational 
research, with the exception of sites where local regulations prohibit this activity.  Patient 
participation in this portion of the study is optional.  Patients will provide consent by signing the 
translational research portion of the informed consent document (ICD).  Patients will not receive 
the translational research results.
The following samples will be collected for translational research:

 Pretreatment paraffin-embedded tissue will be collected from the tissue sample 
taken to make the initial histologic diagnosis of cancer.  The tissue will be used 
for research aimed at identifying markers capable of predicting clinical outcome 
to treatment with pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab.

 A pretreatment plasma sample will be taken to investigate any additional markers 

of interest based on future trial information related to bevacizumab response.
 Whole blood-derived DNA will also be stored for genetic analyses of single 

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or other DNA changes.  

Samples will be collected at the times specified in the Study Schedule (Appendix 1).

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 65

Tissue samples will be collected for immunohistochemical and gene expression analyses, 
including but not limited to:

 Thymidylate synthase (TS):  TS is a direct enzyme target of pemetrexed and plays 
an essential role in DNA synthesis.  Evidence suggests that high levels of TS may 
represent a resistance state to folates.

 Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1):  TTF-1 is a known marker for lung 

histology and a transcription factor that is important in lung development and 
function.  Recent evidence (Kendall et al. 2007; Weir et al. 2007) suggests a role 
as an amplified oncogene in lung cancer.

 Folate receptor-alpha (FR-α):  FR-α is a membrane transporter of folates and may 
contribute to concentration of pemetrexed into the tumor cell.  FR-α levels may be 
varying in different lung histologies present in NSCLC.

 Folylpolyglutamyl synthetase (FPGS):  FPGS is an enzyme responsible for 

polyglutamation of pemetrexed.  This results in higher affinity binding of 
pemetrexed to both the folate-dependent enzymes TS and glycinamide 
ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). 

 Excision-repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency 1 (ERCC1):  

ERCC1 is a DNA repair enzyme thought to play a role in sensitivity to platinum 
agents.  High ERCC1 levels may represent an ability for the tumor to repair 
cleavage induced by platinum agents and thus, a marker of resistance.

Other markers of interest may be examined, based on information evolving at the time the 
laboratory assessments are done.  For example, antiangiogenesis markers such as adhesion 
proteins and circulating VEGF may be investigated.  Taken collectively, these evaluations may 
assist in understanding the biology of lung cancer in this group of patients and their response to 
therapy.
Stored samples will retain the patient identifier (for example, trial patient numbers) and therefore 
will not be stored indefinitely.  Samples will be stored for a maximum of 5 years after the last 
patient visit for the study; any sample remaining at that time will be destroyed.  Samples will be 
stored in the United States.
6.4.3.1. Collection Procedures for Translational Research
At the baseline visit (Visit 0), approximately 10 mL of blood for DNA and approximately 5 mL 
of blood for plasma will be collected by venipuncture.
Supplies required for the collection and shipment of the patients’ stored samples will be supplied 
by the sponsor.  Sample handling and shipment to the central laboratory will occur per 
instructions given to the study site.
A small amount of preserved tissue previously taken to make the initial histologic diagnosis of 
cancer will be obtained for immunohistochemical and gene expression analysis.  The tissue is 
currently preserved in formalin.  The size of the sample will be approximately 3 to 5 mm.

6.5. Appropriateness of Measurements
All efficacy and safety assessments used in this study are appropriate for an oncology study.  
Overall survival is an appropriate primary endpoint in a randomized Phase 3 study.  Progression-
free survival, objective response rate, and PROs are acceptable secondary endpoints and are 
clinically relevant in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.  The FACT-L/Ntx (Cella et al. 
1995; Calhoun et al. 2003) is a reliable and valid instrument used to assess quality of life and 
side effects of treatment in patients with cancer.  The CTCAE (Version 3.0, NCI 2006) is an
acknowledged method used to evaluate AEs in oncology trials.

7. Data Quality Assurance

To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will do the following:




provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate.
sponsor a start-up training session to instruct the investigators and study 
coordinators.  This session will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of 
the CRFs, and study procedures.

 make periodic visits to the study site.


be available for consultation and stay in contact with the study site personnel by 
mail, telephone, and/or fax.
review and evaluate CRF data and use standard computer edits to detect errors in 
data collection.
verify the quality of the data.





In addition, Lilly or its representatives may periodically check a sample of the patient data 
recorded against source documents at the study site.  The study may be audited by Lilly Medical 
Quality Assurance (MQA) or its representatives, and/or regulatory agencies at any time.  
Investigators will be given notice before an audit occurs.
To ensure the safety of participants in the study, and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and patient medical 
records in the patient files as original source documents for the study.  If requested, the 
investigator will provide the sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable ethical 
review boards (ERBs) with direct access to original source documents.
7.1. Data Entry and Computerized Systems
An electronic data capture system will be used in this trial.  Some or all of a patient’s data (for 
example, a rating scale, daily dosing schedule, patient diary, event diary) may be directly entered 
into the system on a CRF (for example, personal desk assistant [PDA], or by means of IVRS) at 
the time that the information is obtained.  In these instances where there is no prior written or 
electronic record of the data, the CRF (for example, PDA, or by means of IVRS) will serve as 
the source document.
Case report form (CRF) data collected by the contract research organization (CRO) will be 
encoded by the CRO and stored electronically in the CRO’s database system.  Validated data 
will subsequently be transferred to the sponsor’s data warehouse, using standard Lilly file 
transfer processes.
Data managed by a central vendor, such as laboratory test data or ECG data, will be stored 
electronically in the central vendor’s database system.  Data will subsequently be transferred 
from the central vendor to the Lilly generic labs system.

Any data for which the CRF will serve as the source document will be identified and 
documented by each site in that site’s study file.
Data from complaint forms submitted to Lilly will be encoded and stored in the global product 
complaint management system.

8. Sample Size and Statistical Methods

8.1. Determination of Sample Size
The primary objective is to compare first-line treatment with pemetrexed, carboplatin, and 
bevacizumab followed by pemetrexed plus bevacizumab (Arm A) versus paclitaxel, carboplatin, 
bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab (Arm B), in terms of OS in patients with Stage IIIB 
(with pleural effusions) or IV NSCLC.
The study will enroll approximately 900 patients (450 per arm), with the final analysis of OS to 
be performed after 676 deaths have occurred.  Assuming an HR of 0.80, this sample size yields 
at least 80% statistical power to detect superiority of the pemetrexed-combination arm over the 
paclitaxel-combination arm with the use of a 1-sided log-rank test and a type I error of 0.025 
(Freedman 1982).  If the true median OS for the paclitaxel-combination arm (Arm B) is 
12.3 months (Sandler et al. 2006), then the HR of 0.8 amounts to an approximately 3-month 
improvement in median OS for the pemetrexed-combination arm (Arm A), under assumption of 
exponential survival distribution.  Assuming approximately 5% screening failure, the study will 
enter approximately 950 patients.  
Pharmacokinetics of total and free platinum (both derived from carboplatin) will be characterized 
in Arm A and Arm B to evaluate whether pemetrexed has any effect on carboplatin disposition.  
For comparing free-platinum PK with or without pemetrexed, PK sampling will be conducted in 
20 patients in each of these 2 arms.  A sample size of 20 patients per arm with at least 18 
completers will have at least 90% power that the 90% CI of the ratio of AUC of free platinum for 
Arm A/Arm B (that is, with pemetrexed/no pemetrexed) will fall within (0.7, 1.43).  A completer 
is defined as a patient who completes the dose administration and PK sampling in Cycle 1 as per 
the PK sampling schedule (see Appendix 7).  This sample size of 18 completers will also provide 
at least 60% power that the 90% CI of the ratio of AUC for total platinum for Arm A/Arm B will 
fall within the limits of (0.7, 1.43).  These calculations are based on the assumption of log-
normal distribution, a true mean ratio of 1 (for both free and total platinum AUC), and an 
estimate of intersubject variability of approximately 26.2% (free platinum) and 42.9% (total 
platinum) reported in a published study (Obasaju et al. 1996).
Bevacizumab PK will also be characterized in both groups of patients to determine if pemetrexed 
has any effect on bevacizumab PK.  A sample size of 18 completers will provide approximately 
70% power for the 90% CI of the ratio of bevacizumab AUC for Arm A/Arm B to fall within the 
limits of (0.7, 1.43).  These calculations are based on the assumption of log-normal distribution, 
a true mean ratio of 1, and an estimate of intersubject variability of approximately 39.7% (AUC) 
from observed bevacizumab data in a published study (Herbst et al. 2005).  
8.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans

8.2.1. General Considerations
Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of Eli Lilly and Company.  The 
interpretation of study results will be the responsibility of the Lilly clinical research physician 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 70

(CRP) and the statistician.  The Lilly CRP and the statistician will also be responsible for the 
appropriate conduct of an internal review process for both the final study report and any study-
related material to be authorized for publication.  Additional independent review of the data may 
be conducted if deemed appropriate.
Efficacy analyses will be conducted according to the ITT principle with patients grouped as 
assigned to treatment. Safety analyses will include all enrolled patients receiving at least 1 dose 
of any of study drugs, grouped as treated.
All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, all tests of 
interactions will be conducted at a 2-sided level of 0.10, and all confidence intervals will be 
given at a 2-sided 95% level, unless otherwise stated.
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any other change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described 
in the clinical study report.  Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as 
deemed appropriate.
8.2.2. Patient Disposition

8.2.3. Patient Characteristics
Patient characteristics will include a summary of the following:





LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 71

8.2.5. Treatment Compliance
The number of dose omissions, reductions, and delays, and the number of cycles received will be 
summarized for all treated patients per treatment arm.  Summarizations will be performed for the 
induction period, the maintenance period, and for the combination of the induction and 
maintenance periods.
8.2.6. Primary Outcome and Methodology
The primary outcome measure for this trial is OS.  All randomized patients, according to the ITT 
principle, will be included in the analysis of OS.  The primary analysis will be the comparison of 
OS between Arm A and Arm B using a 1-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025 (or 
equivalently, at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05).  Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimation (Kaplan 
and Meier 1958), including generating K-M curves, quartiles, and interval estimation using 95% 
confidence intervals, will also be performed.
The supportive analysis of the primary outcome will include a Cox (1972) regression model to 
estimate treatment HR after adjusting for the following potential prognostic variables:

disease stage (IIIB with pleural effusions versus IV)
age ( 70 versus > 70 years)
sex (male versus female)
ethnic origin (Caucasian versus non-Caucasian)
basis for pathologic diagnosis (histopathological versus cytological)






 measurable versus nonmeasurable disease




previously treated brain metastasis (yes versus no)
smoking status (ever versus never)
histologic subtype (adenocarcinoma versus large cell versus other).

Analyses may exclude any cofactor (listed above) from the Cox models for 1 or more of the 
following reasons:  

1.
2.
3.

if the number of patients representing 1 level of that variable is insufficient
if data collected on that variable are insufficiently complete
if that cofactor was consistently found to have no prognostic impact (p > 0.1).

8.2.7. Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The secondary efficacy endpoints are RR, DCR, and time-to-event variables PFS and TTPD.  All 
randomized patients, according to the ITT principle, will be included in the analysis of these 
endpoints.  For each of the time-to-event endpoints, the following analyses will be performed:

 Kaplan-Meier estimation, including generating K-M curves, quartiles, and 

interval estimation using 95% confidence intervals

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 72

log-rank test


 Cox regression model adjusting for the potential prognostic variables listed in 

Section 8.2.6.

The RR and DCR will be compared between Arm A and Arm B using the Fisher exact test.  A 
95% confidence interval for the response rate of each arm will be calculated using an exact 
method.  The RR will be estimated by dividing the total number of confirmed CRs and PRs by 
the total number of patients randomized.  The DCR will be estimated by dividing the total 
number of confirmed CRs, PRs, and SDs by the total number of patients randomized.
8.2.7.1. Time-to-Event Analyses for Patients Who Receive Maintenance Therapy
The analyses listed above for the time-to-event endpoints OS, PFS, and TTPD will also be 
performed for patients who receive maintenance therapy (that is, excluding patients who do not 
receive maintenance therapy).
8.2.7.2. Sensitivity Analysis for PFS and TTPD
In the primary definitions of PFS and TTPD (Section 6.1.2), patients who receive 
postdiscontinuation systemic anticancer therapy are censored as a way to control confounding 
antitumor effect of the subsequent anticancer therapy.  As a sensitivity analysis, the above 
analyses of PFS and TTPD will also be performed when this censoring is not considered.  That 
is, the following definitions for PFS and TTPD will be used to assess the robustness of the PFS 
and TTPD analyses.
Progression-free survival (PFS):  Duration is measured from the date of randomization to the 
date of objective progression of disease or the date of death from any cause, whichever is earlier.  
For patients not known to have died as of the data inclusion cutoff date and who do not have 
objective progressive disease, PFS will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-
free disease assessment prior to the cutoff date.
Time to progressive disease (TTPD):  Time is measured from the date of randomization to the 
first date of objective progression of disease.  For patients not known to have had objective 
progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cutoff date for a particular analysis, or who has 
died without objective progression of disease, TTPD will be censored at the date of the last 
objective progression-free disease assessment prior to the cutoff date.
8.2.8. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
8.2.8.1. Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimation
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be computed using noncompartmental methods of analysis 
using WinNonlin Professional Edition on a computer that meets or exceeds the minimum 
system requirements for this program.  The version of any software used for the analysis will be 
documented and the program will meet the Lilly requirements of software validation.  It is 
possible that other validated equivalent PK software programs may be utilized if appropriate, 
warranted, and approved by Lilly Global Pharmacokinetic management.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 73

Pharmacokinetic parameters to be determined by noncompartmental PK analysis based on 
plasma concentration versus time data for total platinum and free platinum include: AUC0-, 
Cmax, CL, Vss, and t1/2.  For bevacizumab, the PK parameters that will be determined include 
AUC0-, Cmax, and CL.  If data do not allow full characterization, then the analysis may be 
restricted to descriptive evaluation using graphical comparison between Arm A and Arm B.  
Pharmacokinetic evaluation of plasma concentration versus time data for pemetrexed may be 
limited to descriptive evaluation (that is, overlay plot) to verify consistency with reference 
pemetrexed PK results.  In addition, nonlinear mixed effect modeling method (NONMEM) will 
be utilized to fit the plasma concentrations of pemetrexed to the best PK model, relying upon PK 
data and analyses from previous studies.  The PK parameters to be estimated include the plasma 
CL, V, AUC, and  t1/2.
8.2.8.2. Pharmacokinetic Statistical Inference
Free platinum, total platinum, and bevacizumab AUC0-∞ (or partial AUC based on plasma 
concentration time-profile) and Cmax will be log-transformed and analyzed using a mixed-effects 
model allowing for the fixed effect of treatment (such as:  carboplatin with [Arm A] or without 
pemetrexed [Arm B], or bevacizumab with [Arm A] or without pemetrexed [Arm B]) and the 
random effect of patient.
Least squares means will be calculated for carboplatin and bevacizumab AUC in Arm A and in 
Arm B, as well as the mean differences between both treatments (with or without pemetrexed).  
The residual variance from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to calculate the 90% 
confidence intervals for the differences between treatments.  These values will be back 
transformed to give point estimates and 90% confidence interval for the ratios of the treatments.  
For these calculations, Arm B (absence of pemetrexed) will be taken as the reference.  If the 90% 
confidence interval for the ratio of AUCs is contained between 0.7 and 1.43, then it could be 
concluded that no statistically significant drug-drug interaction exists between carboplatin and 
pemetrexed or between bevacizumab and pemetrexed.
Variance components for the interpatient (between) and intrapatient (within) variability in Cmax
and AUC will be obtained through the linear mixed-effects model.  These variances will be 
expressed as coefficients of variation.  The procedure MIXED in the statistical package SAS
will be utilized in running the ANOVA models and in estimating the variance components.
8.2.9. Health Outcome Analyses
The objective of the PRO assessment in this study is to compare clinically meaningful changes in 
patient-reported toxicity effects and lung cancer symptoms over time using the neurotoxicity and 
lung cancer subscales of the FACT-L/Ntx.  Clinically important difference thresholds will be 
used to define the proportion of patients that improve, remain stable, or worsen.    

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 74

The QOL scores will be summed at baseline and for each visit in order to calculate changes from 
baseline mean scores.  These data will be compared between the 2 treatment arms.  The scores 
will include:

 FACT-L total and subscale scores and TOI-L
 FACT/GOG-Ntx total  and subscale scores and TOI-Ntx.

Other exploratory analyses may be performed, including longitudinal modeling (for example, 
repeated measures models and the impact of covariates) and subgroup analysis (for example, age 
 70 versus > 70, and subgroups based on ECOG performance status, tumor response status, 
PFS, and OS).
As a part of analyses, the following definitions apply:

 A patient will be considered as having improved health-related QOL, functioning, 

symptoms, and health status if the change in the scores of the FACT-L/Ntx and 
specific subscales rise by at least a clinically meaningful change where 
established and/or 0.5 standard deviation.

 A patient will be considered as having worse health-related QOL, functioning, 
symptoms, and health status if the change in the scores of the FACT-L/Ntx and 
specific subscales fall by at least a clinically meaningful change where established 
and/or 0.5 standard deviation.

 A patient will be considered as having no change in health-related QOL, 

functioning, symptoms, and health status if the patient does not fall into either 
category above.

The appropriate standard deviation will be estimated from the baseline total and subscale scores 
of all patients (Juniper et al. 1994).  Estimates of clinical meaningful change for classification of 
individuals are shown in Table JMHD.6.  Different values will be used for between-group 
comparisons (Cella et al. 2002a, 2002b).  Distribution- and patient-based global rating of change 
methods will be used for determination of clinically meaningful change for the social/family 
subscale, which has not yet been established.  Further analyses to explore clinically meaningful 
change may be performed (Wyrwich et al. 1999; Fairclough 2002).

If at least 50% of items within a subscale are completed, each missing item will be imputed by 
the average of the completed items; if more than 50% of items within a subscale are missing, the 
score of the subscale will be treated as missing (Cella 1997).  The total FACT-L, total 
FACT/GOG-Ntx, and the TOIs will be scored only if at least 80% of the items that make up 
these composite scores are completed and at least 50% of the items are completed within each 
subscale.  If these 2 conditions are satisfied, each missing item within each subscale will be 
imputed by the average of the completed items within the subscale.  Otherwise, the total FACT-
L, total FACT/GOG-Ntx, and TOI scores will be treated as missing (Fairclough and Cella 1996).
8.2.10. Safety Analyses
The safety evaluation will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of any 
study drug.  Safety analyses will include summaries of the following, grouped by actual 
treatment:

 maximum CTCAE grades for laboratory and nonlaboratory AEs


treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), by severity and 
investigator-determined relatedness to study drug
adverse events causing discontinuation from the study, regardless of causality and 
by investigator-determined relatedness to study drug



 SAEs, regardless of causality and by investigator-determined relatedness to study 

drug
hospitalizations during the study treatment period or during the 30-day 
postdiscontinuation follow-up period

concomitant medications during the study treatment period or during the 30-day 
postdiscontinuation follow-up period (for example, erythropoiesis stimulating 
agents, growth factors, antibiotics, antiseizure agents, antidepressants, and 
analgesics).

The incidences of the above AEs will be compared between Arm A and Arm B using the Fisher 
exact test.
8.2.11. Subgroup Analyses
8.2.11.1. Efficacy Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses of time-to-event endpoints OS, PFS, and TTPD will be performed for each 
potential prognostic factor listed in Section 8.2.6.  For each factor, the treatment-by-subgroup 
interaction will be tested at the 0.10 level of significance using Cox regression model containing 
treatment, the factor, and treatment by the factor interaction in the model.  Then, subsequent log-
rank test, Kaplan-Meier estimate, and Cox regression model will be performed to estimate and 
compare treatment effect in each subgroup category. 
Subgroup analyses of RR and DCR will also be performed for each potential prognostic factor 
listed in Section 8.2.6.  For each factor, the treatment-by-subgroup interaction will be tested at 
the 0.10 level of significance using logistic regression model containing treatment, the factor, 
and treatment by the factor interaction in the model.  Then, subsequent Fisher exact test will be 
performed to compare treatment difference in each subgroup category.
8.2.11.2. Safety Subgroup Analyses
If deemed appropriate, subgroup analyses of selected AEs may be performed for each potential 
prognostic factor listed in Section 8.2.6.  For each factor, the treatment-by-subgroup interaction 
will be tested at the 0.10 level of significance using logistic regression model containing 
treatment, the factor, and treatment by the factor interaction in the model.  Then, subsequent 
Fisher exact test will be performed to compare treatment difference in each subgroup category.
8.2.12. Interim Analyses
Four planned interim analyses will be conducted for this study.

1. The first interim analysis will be conducted for safety and futility after 250 patients have 
been enrolled into the study.  The data cutoff date for inclusion in the interim analysis is 
the date when the 250th patient has completed 4 cycles of treatment or has been followed 
up for 3 months since enrollment if this patient is discontinued before 4 cycles of 
treatment.  All visits completed prior to this data cutoff date will be validated for 
inclusion in the interim database. 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 77

2. The second interim analysis will be conducted for safety when 500 patients have been 
enrolled into the study.  The data cutoff date for inclusion in this interim analysis is the 
date when the 500th patient has completed 1 cycle of treatment.  All visits completed 
prior to this data cutoff date will be validated for inclusion in the interim database.  
3. The third interim analysis will be conducted for safety when 750 patients have been 

enrolled into the study.  The data cutoff date for inclusion in this interim analysis is the 
date when the 750th patient has completed 1 cycle of treatment.  All visits completed 
prior to this data cutoff date will be validated for inclusion in the interim database.

4. The fourth and final interim analysis will be conducted for safety after all planned 900 

patients have been enrolled into the study.  The data cutoff date for inclusion in this 
interim analysis is the date when the last patient has completed 1 cycle of treatment.  All 
visits completed prior to this data cutoff date will be validated for inclusion in the interim 
database.

During each interim lock and analysis period except the fourth interim analysis, patient 
enrollment will continue but will not be included in that interim analysis.
An external DMC will be formed and will be responsible for evaluating interim results.  Only the 
DMC is authorized to review completely unblinded interim efficacy and safety analyses.  The 
DMC will be responsible for making recommendations as to whether continuing study treatment 
and enrollment is scientifically and ethically appropriate.  A list of the planned interim analyses 
will be included in the DMC charter.  A separate interim statistical analysis plan (iSAP) will be 
created after DMC charter approval to contain mocked tables, figures, and listings (mTFLs) for 
the planned interim analyses as well as detailed treatment unblinding.  This iSAP will be a living 
document containing planned as well as any additional interim analyses DMC may request prior 
to interim lock. 
8.2.12.1. Stopping Guidance for Safety
There will be no pre-specified rules for stopping the trial due to safety concerns.  DMC members 
will review unblinded safety data at each interim to determine whether there are sufficient safety 
concerns to justify the termination of study treatment and/or enrollment.
8.2.12.2. Stopping Guidance for Futility at the First Interim
Futility for the first interim analysis will be determined in terms of PFS because the number of 
deaths is likely to be too low to yield a meaningful analysis on OS.  The futility rule will be 
based on conditional power, which is the probability of observing significant results at the final 
analysis under alternative hypothesis assumption, given data at the interim.  Because the 
alternative hypothesis at final analysis is based on the HR for OS, a corresponding alternative 
hypothesis in terms of HR for PFS is needed in order to calculate the conditional power in terms 
of PFS.  It is believed that if the pemetrexed-combination arm (Arm A) can reduce the risk of 
death by 20% (that is, the alternative HR 0.8 for OS), then it should reduce risk of progression by 
at least 10%.  Therefore, the conditional power will be calculated under the alternative 
hypothesis of HR 0.9 for PFS.  

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 78

As guidance, if the conditional power is less than 12% (for illustrative purpose, this corresponds 
to the PFS HR > 1.21 under a Cox PH model), then the trial would be considered futile.  This 
futility analysis will not affect overall alpha level and hence no alpha adjustment is needed for 
this interim analysis.
The futility threshold value of 12% was determined by a simulation study.  In the simulation, the 
exponential PFS data with median PFS time of 6.2 months for the paclitaxel-combination arm 
(Arm B; Sandler et al. 2006) and median PFS time of 6.9 months for the pemetrexed-
combination arm (Arm A) are generated according to the alternative hypothesis of HR 0.9.  If 
250 patients can be enrolled in the first 11 months and all 900 patients can be enrolled in 24 
months, and that the interim analysis will be performed 3 months after the enrollment of 250 
patients, then the conditional power falls below 12% in 5% of 1000 simulations.  Similar 
simulation results can be obtained if enrollment of 900 patients takes up to 30 months.
Because the stopping guidance for this interim analysis was based on a simulation, which was 
based on a number of assumptions (such as exponential PFS, accrual time, and alternative 
hypothesis of HR 0.9 for PFS) that may well be violated by the actual trial enrollment and the 
observed data, the stopping guidance should be viewed as only guidance, not the absolute rules, 
and they may be updated in a separate iSAP prior to an interim datalock if deemed necessary.
8.2.13. Translational Research
The distributions of biomarkers with continuous measures, such as gene or protein expression, 
will be described for the total patient population and by treatment arm.  Summary statistics will 
include means, medians, corresponding standard errors, quartiles, and ranges.  Biomarkers with 
discrete measures, such as genotype locus or IHC-staining-assessed protein expression, will be 
summarized in frequency tables for the total population and by treatment arm.
Associations between clinical endpoints (OS, PFS, TTPD, RR, and DCR) and markers will be 
evaluated using data from patients who have a reported value for the marker measure of interest.  
Markers and their interaction with treatment will be assessed on an individual basis; that is, a 
given marker will be analyzed separately.  Discrete measures, such as IHC–staining-assessed 
protein expression or marker genotype, will be assessed by including these measures as a class 
effect in the appropriate analytical models.  Continuous measures, such as relative gene 
expression levels, will be dichotomized into low- and high-value groups at the point that best 
associates these groups with the particular clinical outcome.
Patients will be ordered according to the value of the appropriate measure of marker expression 
and divided into low- and high-expression subgroups, beginning at the 25th quartile.  This 
grouping, along with its interaction with treatment, will be included as a class effect in the 
analytical model (for example, Cox regression of time-to-event endpoints).  The model will be fit 
in an iterative fashion by forming groups at each point from the 25% to the 75% cut point of the 
population.  The Wald chi-square statistics for the interaction term from each analysis will be 
compared, and the maximum value will be used to test the ability of a marker to identify 
differences in treatment impact on clinical outcome.  Because this test statistic is the maximum 
from a set of values, a direct comparison with the one-degree-of-freedom chi-square distribution

is not appropriate.  The probability of the maximum chi-square value will be assessed using an 
asymptotic cumulative distribution function formula described by Miller and Siegmund (1982).

Informed Consent, Ethical Review, and Regulatory 

Considerations

Informed Consent

9.1.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the patient understands the risks and benefits of 
participating in the study, including answering any questions the patient may have throughout the 
study and sharing in a timely manner any new information that may be relevant to the patient's 
willingness to continue his or her participation in the trial.
The ICD will be used to explain the risks and benefits of study participation to the patient in 
simple terms before the patient is entered into the study, and to document that the patient is 
satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in the study and 
desires to participate in the study.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by each patient or 
legal representative.  This includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the ICD 
prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the administration of study drug.
As used in this protocol, the term "informed consent" includes all consent and assent given by 
patients or their legal representatives.
9.2. Ethical Review
Lilly must agree with all ICDs before they are submitted to the ethical review boards (ERBs) and 
are used at investigative sites.  All informed consent documents must be compliant with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline on good clinical practice (GCP).  
Informed consent obtained under special circumstances may occur only if allowed by local laws 
and regulations and performed in accordance with a written process approved by Lilly.
Documentation of ERB approval of the protocol and the ICD must be provided to Lilly before
the study may begin at the investigative sites.  The ERBs will review the protocol as required.
Any member of an ERB who is directly affiliated with this study as an investigator or as site 
personnel must abstain from the ERB’s vote on the approval of the protocol.
The ERBs should be provided with the following:






the current investigator’s brochure or package labeling and updates during the 
course of the study
informed consent document
relevant curricula vitae.

9.3. Regulatory Considerations
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in 
the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with good clinical practices and the applicable 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Investigator Information

laws and regulations.  The investigator, head of the medical institution, or designee will promptly 
submit the protocol to applicable ERBs.
Pemetrexed is being studied in the United States under a US Investigational New Drug (IND) 
application.  The US IND number is 40,061.
All or some of the obligations of the sponsor will be assigned to a CRO.
An identification code assigned by the investigator to each patient will be used in lieu of the 
patient's name to protect the patient's identity when reporting AEs and/or other trial-related data.
9.3.1.
Physicians with a specialty in oncology will participate as investigators in this clinical trial.
9.3.2. Protocol Signatures
After reading the protocol, each principal investigator will sign the protocol signature page and 
send a copy of the signed page to a Lilly representative.
9.3.3. Final Report Signature
The clinical study report coordinating investigator will sign the final clinical study report for this 
study, indicating agreement that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the report accurately 
describes the conduct and results of the study.
The investigator chosen by Lilly will serve as the clinical study report coordinating investigator.
The sponsor’s responsible medical officer will sign the final clinical study report for this study, 
confirming that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the report accurately describes the conduct 
and results of the study.

a Baseline:  0 to 14 days prior to C1D1, unless otherwise noted.
b For patients continuing maintenance therapy beyond Cycle 504:  (1) Perform tumor assessment at even-numbered cycles (for example, at Cycles 510 and 

512).  (2) Administer other procedures, tests, premedication, and study drug at each additional cycle as shown for Cycle 504.

c The 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up period begins on the day after the patient and the investigator agree to discontinue the patient from the treatment 

portion of the trial and lasts approximately 30 days.  The 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up visit occurs at or near the end of the 30-day

and/or clinical abnormalities.

i Patient should complete FACT-L/Ntx questionnaires (see Protocol Attachment JMHD.8):

(1) Once at baseline, up to 7 days prior to C1D1.  (2) At the end of each cycle, prior to administration of study drug at the next cycle.  (3) At the time of 
discontinuation.  (4) At the 30-day follow-up visit.

j Perform radiologic and physical assessment of tumors per RECIST guidelines (see Protocol Attachment JMHD.4).  Measurements should be recorded in 

metric notation by use of a ruler or calipers.  Throughout the study, radiologic assessment must be performed using the same imaging modality, covering the 
same anatomy, as used at the baseline assessment.  Conventional or spiral CT or MRI is preferred.  Chest x-ray is acceptable for clearly defined lesions that 
are surrounded by aerated lung.
Response confirmation:  Responses must be confirmed.  Confirmation should be performed 28 to 48 days after the initial response documentation and 
repeated every 6 weeks  2 weeks.
Timing of tumor assessment:  (1) At baseline:  radiologic assessment no more than 28 days prior to C1D1; physical assessment within 14 days prior to C1D1.  
(2) During study therapy:  every 6 weeks  2 weeks.  For example, assessment two weeks following C2D1, C4D1, etc.  (3) At the 30-day FU visit.  (4) For 
patients who discontinue from study therapy for reasons other than disease progression:  every 6 weeks  2 weeks, until disease progression.

k At baseline, perform physical examination and brain imaging (CT scan or MRI) in all patients to determine eligibility.  Beginning at Cycle 2, randomized 
patients who have stable treated brain metastasis should be monitored every 2 cycles and during the postdiscontinuation follow-up period using the same 
imaging modality that was used at baseline.  Stable treated brain metastasis is defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after 
treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (CT or MRI) at baseline.

l Hematology should be performed as follows:
(1) Baseline - within 14 days prior to C1D1.
(2) Cycle 1 - on Days 8 and 15 (± 1 day).
(3) Cycles 2, 3, and 4 - (a) within 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle and (b) on Days 8 and 15 (± 1 day) of each cycle.
(4) Maintenance therapy - within 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle; additional hematology values may be collected during maintenance therapy per local 

practice guidelines or at the investigator’s discretion.

(5) At the 30-day follow-up visit.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory report.

30-day FU visit (calculated CrCl is not required at the 30-day FU visit).  Additional chemistry values may be collected per local practice guidelines.  
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory report.

n Perform PK plasma sampling as shown in Protocol Attachment JMHD.7.
o

(1) At baseline, perform UPCR within 14 days prior to C1D1.  If UPCR is  1, perform 24-hour urine collection.  Patient may be enrolled if < 1 g of protein in 
a 24-hour urine collection.  (2) Beginning at Cycle 2, perform UPCR or urine dipstick at each cycle.  If patients enrolled with UPCR  1 at baseline, it is not 
required to repeat the 24-hour urine collection in these patients on subsequent cycles, unless urine protein increases from the baseline value.

p Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to C1D1.  Patients are considered not of childbearing 

potential if:  (a) they are surgically sterile (that is, have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or (b) they are 
postmenopausal.  Patients may be entered and enrolled on the basis of a local serum or urine pregnancy test; however, local laboratory results must be 
confirmed by a serum pregnancy test performed by the central laboratory.

q PT/INR should be measured within 14 days prior to C1D1 for patients on subtherapeutic anticoagulation therapy.  For patients beginning anticoagulation

Day 1 is the day that the dose is actually administered, and all study drugs should be administered on the same day.  Note that Day 1 may be delayed >3 days 
due to protocol defined cycle delays to allow for recovery from toxicity (see Sections 5.5.1.1, 5.5.1.2, and 5.5.1.3).  If bevacizumab is omitted from a cycle 
due to toxicity, the other drugs should be administered on Day 1 ± 3 days (see Section 5.5.1.5).

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 102

RECIST Guidelines

Protocol Attachment JMHD.4.
Measurability of Tumor Lesions at Baseline:
Measurable lesions:  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension as  20 mm 
with conventional techniques or as   10 mm with spiral CT scan (longest diameter to be 
recorded).
Nonmeasurable lesions:  All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 20 mm 
with conventional techniques or < 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly nonmeasurable lesions.  
Lesions considered to be truly nonmeasurable include the following:  bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging 
techniques, and cystic lesions.
Documentation of “Target” and “Nontarget” Lesions at Baseline:
All tumor measurements will be recorded in centimeters using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the start of treatment but never more than 
28 days before beginning treatment.
Target:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinically).  If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic 
nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.
A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum longest diameter.  The baseline sum longest diameter will be used as the reference by which 
to characterize the objective tumor response.
Nontarget:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including small lesions (longest diameter < 20 
mm with conventional CT scan, < 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and other non-measurable lesions 
should be identified as nontarget lesions and should be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence of absence of each should be noted throughout 
follow up.
Method of Measurement:
The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow up.  Computed tomography (CT), or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm.  This applies to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Chest X-ray is acceptable as 
measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT 
scan or MRI is preferred.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMHD(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 103

RECIST Guidelines (continued)

Protocol Attachment JMHD.4.
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (for example, skin 
nodules, or palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.
Timing of Subsequent Tumor Assessments:
Radiological and physical assessments will be routinely reviewed as specified in the Study 
Schedule (Protocol Attachment JMHD.1).  All areas of disease must be re-evaluated at each 
subsequent assessment.  The same technique used at baseline must be used.  Chest x-rays are 
acceptable for a subsequent assessment if used at baseline, however CT scan or MRI is preferred.
If the patient’s disease has responded to therapy, the investigator must confirm the response.  It is 
recommended that confirmation of response occur  28 days and  42 days after the first 
evidence of response using the same radiological technique as at baseline.  The baseline sum of 
longest diameters of target lesions will be used as reference for confirmation of response.
Both measurable and nonmeasurable lesions should be evaluated at each restaging to determine
whether they have completely resolved or persisted, or whether new lesions have appeared.
Response Criteria:
Patients will be assessed using the following criteria:

 Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all tumor lesions.
 Partial response (PR): Either a) at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum 
LDs or b) complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (but not 
worsening) of 1 or more nontarget lesions.  In either case, no new lesions may 
have appeared. 

 Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 

sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD.
 Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target 
lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment 
started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.

 Unknown:  Progression has not been documented and 1 or more target or nontarget 

sites have not been assessed.

Pharmacokinetic Sampling Instructions

Protocol Attachment JMHD.7.
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of pemetrexed, bevacizumab, and platinum 
(total platinum and free platinum) concentrations in plasma.  Blood samples for pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis will be obtained during Cycle 1.
It is essential that the following dosing information be collected and reported:  the exact infusion 
start and stop times (actual clock readings), date of infusion, body surface area, and dose 
administered.  Samples are to be collected at the times specified below.  The exact time of 
collection of each venous blood sample will be based on the same clock used to record infusion 
times.  Accurate recording of the actual sample collection times is essential.
It is essential that every PK blood sample be withdrawn from an arm vein not in direct contact 
with the drug infusion solution.  If a heparin lock is used, the first milliliter (1 mL) of blood 
withdrawn from the venous catheter will be discarded prior to each sample collection to avoid 
dilution of the blood sample with the solution in the catheter.  Thereafter, approximately 4 mL of 
heparinized blood will be collected for each drug at the specified time points.  The samples will 
be processed, stored, and shipped according to the instructions supplied in the central laboratory 
manual.

It is essential that samples are collected immediately prior to the end of the drug infusions (< 1 
min before the end of the infusion) in order to obtain plasma concentrations to evaluate 
maximum systemic exposure.
Each blood sample will be collected at the times specified below to facilitate evaluation of these 
data by standard PK analysis methods.  Pharmacokinetic parameters to be determined based on 
plasma concentration versus time data include: AUC(0-), Cmax, CL, and Vss.

Interval History

Protocol Attachment JMHD.9.
To specifically elicit any symptoms of GI toxicity, the patients should be asked at each interval 
history about symptoms of constipation, abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding.
To specifically elicit any symptoms of neurotoxicity, the patients should be asked at each 
interval history about symptoms of paresthesias, pareses, dysesthesias, and neuropathic pain.
Answers to these questions are to be documented in the patient’s medical record.  Positive 
responses should be appropriately evaluated.

a The 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up period begins on the day after the patient and the investigator agree to 

discontinue the patient from the treatment portion of the trial and lasts approximately 30 days.  The 30-day 
postdiscontinuation follow-up visit occurs at or near the end of the 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up period 
(see Figure JMHD.3).

b During study therapy, perform before each cycle.
c Study drug may be administered ± 3 days from scheduled Day 1 of current cycle (Day 22 from prior cycle) only 

due to unavoidable scheduling conflicts.  Day 1 is the day that the dose is actually administered, and all study 
drugs should be administered on the same day.  Note that Day 1 may be delayed >3 days due to protocol-defined 
cycle delays to allow for recovery from toxicity (see Sections 5.5.1.2, 5.5.1.3, and 5.5.1.4).  If bevacizumab is 
omitted from a cycle due to toxicity, pemetrexed should be administered on Day 1 ± 3 days (see Section 5.5.1.5).

d Pemetrexed – Arm A:  500 mg/m2 iv administered over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.
e Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg iv over 30 to 90 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.  See Section 5.2.4 for bevacizumab 

administration guidelines.  Arm A:  Administer bevacizumab after pemetrexed.

Pemetrexed – Arm A

5.2.1.
Pemetrexed for injection will be provided by Lilly and is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized 
powder for intravenous infusion packaged in a single-use glass vial.  Each vial contains 
pemetrexed disodium equivalent to 500 mg of pemetrexed.  The freeze-dried drug product is 
pemetrexed disodium and mannitol in a 1:1 ratio.  Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid 
solution may have been added during processing to adjust the pH.  Each vial contains an excess 
of pemetrexed to facilitate the withdrawal of the label amount.  The drug product is stable when 
stored at controlled room temperature and normal lighting conditions.
Each vial must be reconstituted with sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for injection, without 
preservative, resulting in a solution containing 10 mg/mL to 50 mg/mL.  Gently swirl each vial 
until the powder is completely dissolved.  The resulting solution is clear and ranges in color from 
colorless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product quality.  The pH of the 
reconstituted solution is between 6.8 and 7.8.  Further dilution is required.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
prior to administration.  If particulate matter or a dark green color is observed, do not administer.
The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution should be further diluted to 75 to 
125 mL with sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for injection, without preservative.  Pemetrexed 
infusion solutions prepared in this manner are compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and 
polyolefin line administration sets and infusion bags.
When prepared as directed, reconstituted and infusion solutions of pemetrexed contain no 
antimicrobial preservatives.  Chemical and physical stability of reconstituted and infusion 
solutions were demonstrated for up to 24 hours following initial reconstitution, when stored at 
refrigerated or room temperatures.  From a microbiological point of view, the product should be 
used immediately or within 24 hours following initial reconstitution.  Discard any unused 
portion.
Reconstitution and further dilution prior to intravenous infusion is recommended with sodium 
chloride (0.9%) solution for injection, without preservative, only.  Pemetrexed is physically 
incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including Lactated Ringer's injection and 
Ringer’s Injection.  Coadministration of pemetrexed with other drugs and diluents has not been 
studied, and therefore, is not recommended.For instructions on reconstitution and administration 
of pemetrexed, refer to the IB (Safe Handling and Administration).
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country's local regulatory requirements.
