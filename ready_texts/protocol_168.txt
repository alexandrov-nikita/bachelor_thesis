PROTOCOL CHANGES FROM VERSION 7.0:
The primary purpose of this amendment is to make provisions for an Extension Lead Period and an Extension Period.  The Extension Lead Period is being 
introduced because the study did not meet its primary endpoint. During the Extension Lead Period, patients still on study treatment and experiencing ongoing 
clinical benefit will be unblinded and allowed to continue to receive study treatment.  Reduced data such as overall survival, adverse events, and drug exposure
will be collected.  Once the overall survival endpoint is achieved (792 events) an Extension Period will begin.  During the Extension Period, patients still on 
study treatment and experiencing ongoing clinical benefit will continue receiving study treatment.  Overall survival data will no longer be collected during this
Extension Period (the only difference between the Extension Lead Period and the Extension Period). Additional changes have been made to incorporate or revise 
language for consistency with the protocol template and/or standards of the Sponsor.  Any deleted text is crossed out and new text is underscored and or bolded 
and in red to aid the reader in identifying what was modified.

death or for at least 36 months after discontinuing study therapy or until the extension period begins (as defined in Section 4.5).
The extension period will begin after study  completion (see Section 4.5).  In the extension period, survival follow-up will be 
discontinued. 

Since the study failed to meet the primary endpoint, data collection will be reduced and an extension lead period will begin for 
patients still under study treatment (see Section 4.4).  All patients will be informed of pertinent study updates and changes.  At the

consent form (ICF) before entering the extension lead period.  In case a patient under study treatment does not consent to enter in 
the extension lead period, the patient will be withdrawn from study treatment and will be followed for 30-day safety and survival.  
The extension lead period includes:





Study therapy administration:  During the extension lead period, patients still under study treatment (IMC-1121B/Placebo 
plus docetaxel or IMC-1121B/ docetaxel only) will be unblinded.  Once unblinded, patients will be given the opportunity 
to continue active study treatment upon request / investigator decision.  During the extension lead period, placebo 
however will no longer be administered, and crossover will not be permitted.  Patients who are withdrawn from study 
drug (IMC-1121B/Placebo) can continue to be treated with docetaxel until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or when other withdrawal criteria are met.
30-day Safety follow-up:  Begins after the investigator decides that the patient will no longer continue study treatment 
(IMC-1121B plus docetaxel or IMC-1121B/docetaxel only) in the extension lead period and lasts approximately 30 days 
after the last study treatment administration.  Patients who are in the 30-day Safety follow-up when the extension lead 
period begins will continue in safety follow-up until the 30-day Safety follow-up visit is completed.  

After the 30-Day Safety Follow-Up, patients will be followed for survival until study completion (see Section 7.4.2.2).  During the 
extension lead period, AEs, SAEs, and study treatment (IMC-1121B plus docetaxel, IMC-1121B /docetaxel only) exposure will be 
reported on the CRF for all patients.  Serious adverse events will also be reported to the TRIO Safety Officer (see Section 8.9).  In 
the event that an SAE occurs, ImClone/Lilly or TRIO may request additional information (such as local laboratory results, 
concomitant medications, and hospitalizations) in order to evaluate the reported SAE.  Blood samples for PK and immunogenicity 
analysis will be collected in the event of an infusion-related reaction and during the 30-day safety follow-up. 
Investigators should perform any other standard and/or protocol procedures and tests (see Sections 6 and 7.2) needed to treat and 
evaluate patients.  ImClone/Lilly or TRIO will not routinely collect the results of these assessments.  
The extension period begins after study completion and ends at the end of trial.  During the extension period, patients still on study 
treatment at the end of the extension lead period and experiencing ongoing clinical benefit may continue to receive study treatment 
until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or when other withdrawal criteria are met.  ImClone/Lilly or TRIO 
will notify investigators when the extension period begins. 
The extension period includes:





Study therapy administration:  During the extension period, patients may continue to receive study treatment (IMC-
1121B plus docetaxel or IMC-1121B/docetaxel only) until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 
when other withdrawal criteria are met.  
30-day Safety follow-up:  Begins after the investigator decides that the patient will no longer continue study treatment 
(IMC-1121B plus docetaxel or IMC-1121B/docetaxel only) in the extension period and lasts approximately 30 days after 
the last study treatment administration.  Patients who are in the 30-day Safety follow-up when the extension period begins 
will continue in safety follow-up until the 30-day Safety follow-up visit is completed.

the following information will be collected according to Table 2 in Section 7.7:

 AE assessment (including SAEs), as requested in Section 8.5.  In the event that an SAE occurs, the Sponsor may request 

additional information (such as local laboratory results, concomitant medications, and hospitalizations) in order to 
evaluate the reported SAE;

Study Design:      
This  is  a  multicenter,  randomized  study  evaluating  the  efficacy  of  IMC-1121B  in 
combination  with  docetaxel  as  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  comparison.    One 
thousand and one hundred thirteen (1113) patients will be randomized in the study, in a 2:1 
ratio (IMC-1121B plus docetaxel:placebo plus docetaxel = 742:371).  Upon  registration 
and  completion  of  screening  procedures, eligible  patients  with  HER2-negative, 
unresectable,  locally-recurrent  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  will  be  randomized  to 
IMC-1121B plus docetaxel or placebo plus docetaxel.
Treatment  will  be  continued  until  disease  progression,  unacceptable  toxicity, or  other 
withdrawal  criteria  are  met.    All  patients  will  be  followed  for  survival  at  regularly 
scheduled intervals (every 6 months) until death or until the extension period begins. In the 
extension period, survival follow-up will be discontinued.
Since the study failed to meet the primary endpoint, data collection will be reduced and an 
extension lead period will begin.  At the beginning of the extension lead period, patients 
under study drug (IMC-1121B/Placebo) will be unblinded.  
A group sequential analysis for the primary objective, the comparison of PFS between the 
2 study arms will be conducted.  Futility analyses will be conducted when 25% and 40% of 
the expected number of PFS events are observed, approximately 200 and 318 PFS events, 
respectively.    A final  analysis  will  be  performed  once  796 PFS  expected  events  are 
observed. These interim analyses will be performed by an Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) which will recommend early discontinuation of the study for futility
or continuation of the study for full patient accrual.
Upon completion of the primary endpoint analyses for the 796 PFS events, the IDMC will 
no  longer  be  needed,  as  the  Sponsor  will  have  been  unblinded.  The  Sponsor  will  be 
responsible for future safety reviews. The IDMC will be decommissioned at that time.  
One single interim analysis for OS will be performed at the time of the final PFS analysis 
or  when  at  least  375  OS  events  have  been  observed  (whichever  is  later),  and  a  final 
efficacy analysis will be conducted when at least 792 OS events are observed during the 
study follow-up.   
Study Population:  
Female  patients  at  least  18  years  of  age  with  histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed,
HER2-negative  breast adenocarcinoma. At the time of study  entry the disease  must  be
metastatic or locally-recurrent and inoperable with curative intent.  Patients may not have 
received chemotherapy or biologic therapy for metastatic or locally-recurrent, inoperable 
breast cancer.
Test Product, Dose, Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment:  
IMC-1121B  injection  for  intravenous  use  will  be  supplied  in  sterile  single-use, 
preservative  free  vials  in  a  histidine-buffered  formulation  at  a  final  concentration  of 
10 mg/mL  (500  mg/50  mL).    IMC-1121B  placebo  is  supplied  in  sterile  single-use 
preservative  free  vials  containing  only  the  histidine-buffered  formulation  vehicle.  
IMC-1121B or placebo will  be administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg as an approximately

one-hour I.V. infusion on Day 1 (± 3 days) of each 21-day cycle.  Patients are treated until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met.
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment:
Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) is administered as an approximately one-hour I.V. infusion on Day 
1 (±  3  days)  of  each  21-day  cycle.    Patients  are  treated  until  disease  progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met.
Efficacy Assessments:  
PFS,  overall  survival,  and  TTP  will  be  assessed  as  described  in  Planned  Statistical 
Methods.  Tumor response and progression will be evaluated both by the investigator and 
by an independent review committee (IRC), using RECIST guidelines[1] which have been 
modified  based  on  current  practices  of the  medical  community.[2] ORR and  response 
duration will also be evaluated.
Safety Assessments:  
Safety  will  be  evaluated  based  on  recorded  adverse  events,  physical  examinations,  and
laboratory tests.  An IDMC will  meet at least twice per  year, when 50 and 150 patients 
have received at least 2 cycles of study drug, died, or discontinued study drug, and at the 
time of each of the interim futility analyses to perform an unblinded review of the safety 
data to minimize patient exposure to any unexpected or unnecessary risks.
Optional Exploratory Studies:  
Whole blood and/or tumor samples will be collected in order to identify potential markers 
predicting  efficacy  and/or  safety  and  to  determine  the  effect  of  genetic  variations  on 
efficacy and/or safety.  DNA might be used for exploratory pharmacogenomic analyses, 
provided the patient signs a separate informed consent.  These exploratory studies will be 
based on voluntary participation from investigators and patients.
Statistical Methods:
Patients will be centrally randomized through an interactive web response system (IWRS).  
At  randomization,  patients  will  be  stratified by prior  taxane  therapy  (yes/no),  visceral 
metastasis  (yes/no),  hormone  receptor  status  (positive  vs.  negative/unknown), and 
geographical  region  (the  Americas,  Europe/Australia/New  Zealand,  and  Asia/Middle-
East/Africa).
Primary Endpoint:
Progression-Free  Survival:    the  interval  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  first 
documented  date  of  disease  progression  or  death from  any  cause.    Following  a  group 
sequential  method using the  beta-spending  function approach with 2  interim and 1 final 
analysis, a total of 1113 patients will allow the detection of a PFS superiority of 33% in the 
docetaxel plus IMC-1121B group versus the docetaxel control group (8.0 months versus 
6.0 months median time, respectively), with an experimentwise alpha level of 5% and a 
power of about 86%.  Two interim futility analyses will be performed at 25% and 40% of 
the  expected  PFS  events.   The  final  analysis  will  be  performed  once  796 PFS  expected 
events are observed assuming full enrollment.
Secondary Endpoints:
Overall Survival:  the  interval  from randomization to the date of death  from any cause.  
One single interim analysis for OS will be performed at the time of the final PFS analysis

or  when  at  least  375  OS  events  have  been  observed  (whichever  is  later),  and  a  final 
efficacy analysis will be conducted when at least 792 OS events are observed during the 
study  follow-up.   At   the  time  of  final  PFS  analysis,  only  if  the  primary  PFS  test  is 
significant, will the analyses of OS (as outlined above) be considered inferential.   In the 
case that the primary PFS results do   not favor the IMC-1121B arm, then consideration to 
close the study will be discussed.    
Time to Progression:  the interval from the date of randomization to the first documented 
date of disease progression. 
Objective Response Rate:  the percentage of patients assigned to a treatment arm with a 
confirmed best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).
Duration of Response:  the interval from date of initial documented response (CR or PR) to 
the first documented date of disease progression or death. 
Safety:  will be analyzed for all patients who receive any quantity of study treatment.
Quality  of  Life:    the  quality  of  life  assessment  will  be  conducted  using  the  FACT-B 
questionnaire.

INTRODUCTION

1
The purpose of this study  is to compare the effects of the drug combination IMC-1121B plus 
docetaxel  to  placebo plus  docetaxel  on  antitumor  activity  and  safety in  previously  untreated 
patients with HER2-negative, unresectable, locally-recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

1.1 Breast Cancer

Breast  cancer  is  the  most  common  malignancy  among  women,  accounting  for  nearly  1 in  3
cancers diagnosed among women in the United States (US),[3] and the second leading cause of 
cancer deaths in women with an estimated 40,460 breast cancer deaths in 2007.[4]  Worldwide, 
breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the world and accounts for 23% of all cancer cases 
among women, with an estimated 1.15 million new cases in 2002.[3]  In the US, approximately 
178,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 62,030 in situ cases are expected to occur in 
women in 2007.  Breast cancer incidence rates increased rapidly among women of all races from 
1980 to 1987, which has been attributed in part to better detection due to the increasing use of 
mammography.  The global incidence rates of breast cancer are increasing in most countries with 
an  overall  increase  of  0.5%  annually,  and  the  increases have  been  greatest  where  rates  were 
previously  low.[5]   From   a  global  perspective,  breast  cancer  is  the  leading  cause  of  cancer 
mortality in women with 410,712 deaths worldwide in 2002 representing 14% of female cancer 
deaths.[3]

Although only a small portion of patients are initially diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, 
approximately 30-40% of all patients with early  breast cancer treated with curative intent will 
ultimately  develop  metastatic  disease. Hormonal  therapy,  antibody  therapy,  radiotherapy, 
limited surgery, and chemotherapy (alone or  in combination) have been used  for the  first  line 
treatment  of  metastatic  breast  cancer.[6]   Nonetheless,  the  median  survival  for  patients  with 
metastatic  breast  cancer  is  18  to  24  months,  although  some  patients  experience  long-term 
survival.[7]  The 5-year survival for women with distant metastases is 26%.[4]  Despite advances 
in treatment options, metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease.  Therefore,  optimal 
palliation and prolongation of life are the main goals of therapy, and improvements in systemic 
therapy are required.

VEGF and Angiogenesis

1.2
Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries and blood vessels, is a tightly controlled, multi-
step process that is a component of normal physiology (including development of the embryonic 
vasculature,  wound  healing, ovulation,  and  menstruation)  and  pathology (including  tumor 
growth and metastasis, as well as in several other human diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis).[8],[9],[10]  A number of growth factors have been identified 
as  positive  regulators  of  angiogenesis,  including  members  of  the  vascular  endothelial  growth 
factor  (VEGF)
family, basic  fibroblast  growth  factor,  transforming  growth  factor  alpha, 
transforming  growth  factor  beta  (TGF-β),  tumor  necrosis  factor,  platelet-derived  endothelial 
growth  factor,  hepatocyte  growth  factor,  angiogenin,  interleukin-8,  and  placental  growth 
factor.[11],[12]  VEGF-A is one of several related cytokines and is distinct in that it acts as an 
endothelial cell-specific mitogen and is the growth factor most consistently found in conditions 
associated with angiogenesis.[13],[14],[15],[16]  The  biological activity of VEGF-A (hereafter 
referred  to  as  VEGF)  is  mediated  principally  by  2 structurally  related,  high  affinity  tyrosine 
kinase  receptors,  the  180  kDa  fms-like  tyrosine  kinase  (VEGFR-1  or  Flt-1)[17],[18]  and  the 
200 kDa receptor (VEGFR-2 or KDR), or its  murine  homologue,  fetal  liver kinase-1.[19],[20]  
Targeted  deletion  of genes  encoding  VEGF,  VEGFR-1,  or  VEGFR-2  in  mice  is  lethal  to the 
embryo,  demonstrating  the  physiological  importance  of  the  VEGF  pathway  in  blood  vessel 
formation.    Mice  lacking  even  a  single  VEGF  allele  die  prior  to  birth  due  to  vascular 
abnormalities.[21],[22]  VEGFR-2-deficient mice have impaired blood island formation and lack 
mature endothelial  cells,[23] whereas VEGFR-1  null embryos  have  abundant endothelial  cell-
like cells, but fail to develop normal vasculature.[24]

The Role of VEGFR and VEGFR-2 in Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth
1.3
The  importance  of  VEGF  and  VEGFR-2  in  angiogenesis  and  tumor  growth  has  been 
demonstrated in several animal models.  The expression of VEGFR-2 is selectively associated 
with  activated  endothelium[13] and  is  strongly  upregulated  in  tumor  endothelium.[13],[25]  
Disabling the function of VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway via a number of approaches, including anti-
VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies, anti-VEGF antisense ribonucleic acid expression, 
VEGF-based immunotoxins, soluble VEGF receptors, ribozymes to VEGF receptors, and small

molecule  VEGFR-2  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors,  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  new  blood  vessel 
formation and tumor growth in a variety of animal models.[26],[27],[28],[29]

VEGF  and  VEGFR-2  are  overexpressed  in  the  great  majority  of  human  cancers,  including
carcinomas  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  pancreas,  breast,  cervix,  bladder,  ovary,  uterus, 
endometrium, and kidney; Kaposi’s sarcoma; glioblastoma multiforme; and hemangioblastomas.  
In addition,  messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)  for both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2  is greatly 
upregulated in tumor-associated endothelial cells, but not in the vasculature of the surrounding 
normal tissue.  A correlation between VEGFR-2 expression and tumor microvessel density has 
been  associated  with  poor  prognosis,  advanced  disease,  increased  risk  of  metastasis  and 
recurrence, and lower relapse-free survival in patients with a variety of cancers.[10],[29]

Accumulating evidence suggests that the dual autocrine/paracrine mechanism also may play an 
important  role  in  the  growth  and  metastasis  of  certain  solid  tumors.    For  example,  a 
VEGF/VEGFR autocrine loop was proposed as a mediator of growth and metastasis of several 
types of tumors, including breast.[29]  These observations suggest that anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies 
may have potential as antiangiogenic and antitumor agents in the treatment of solid tumors.

VEGF and Breast Cancer

1.4
During the last 2 decades, substantial preclinical and indirect clinical evidence has accumulated 
to support the central role of angiogenesis in breast cancer progression.[30],[31]  Hyperplastic 
murine  breast  papillomas[32] and  histologically  normal  lobules  adjacent  to  cancerous  breast 
tissue[33] support  angiogenesis  in  preclinical  models,  suggesting  that  angiogenesis  precedes 
transformation  of  mammary  hyperplasia  to  malignancy.    Transfection  of  tumor  cells  with 
angiogenic  stimulatory  peptides  has  been  shown  to  increase  tumor  growth,  invasiveness,  and 
metastasis.[34]

Clinicopathologic correlations  also  confirm  the  central  role  of  angiogenesis  in  breast  cancer 
progression.  Microvessel density was shown to be highest with histopathologically aggressive 
ductal  carcinoma-in-situ  lesions[35] and  associated  with  increased  VEGF  expression.[36]  
Fibrocystic lesions with the highest vascular density are associated with a greater risk of breast 
cancer.[37]  Increased microvessel density in premalignant lesions has been associated with high

risk  of  future  breast  cancer.[37]   Also,  high  microvessel  density  in  invasive  disease  has  been 
correlated with an increased likelihood of metastatic disease[38] and a shorter relapse and overall 
survival (OS) in patients with node-negative breast cancer.[39]

Multiple angiogenic factors are commonly expressed by invasive human breast cancers including 
VEGF,  thymidine  phosphorylase  and  TGF-β1.[40]   VEGF  expression  has  also  been  found  to 
correlate  with  risk  and  outcomes  in  breast  cancer.    Several  studies  have  found  an  inverse 
correlation  between  VEGF  expression  and  overall  survival  in  both  node-positive  and  node-
negative breast cancer.[41],[42]  Increased VEGF expression has been associated with impaired 
response  to  tamoxifen  or  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced  breast  cancer.[43]   The 
expression  and  intensity  of  expression  were  found  to  correlate  with  a  significantly  inferior 
outcome of breast cancer.[44]  A  high degree of expression of VEGF mRNA and protein was 
found  in  invasive  ductal  carcinoma,  metastatic  ductal  carcinoma,  and  comedo-type  ductal 
carcinoma  in  situ,  with  lower  expression  in  lobular  carcinoma.[45]   These  data  suggest  that 
VEGF may be the rate limiting factor in the tumor-related switch to an angiogenic phenotype 
that is critical for growth and metastasis.[46]

1.5 Anti-angiogenic Agents and Breast Cancer
The  first  major clinical  study to show the benefit of anti-angiogenic therapy  for patients with 
breast  cancer  was  the  demonstration  of  bevacizumab 
in  combination  with  paclitaxel 
(E2100 trial).[47]  In an interim analysis, combination therapy delayed the progression of disease 
in  untreated  patients  with  metastatic  disease  by  a  median of  approximately  5 months.    The 
progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with combination therapy was 10.97 months 
compared  with  6.11 months  for  paclitaxel-treated  patients.    The  response  rate  also  favored 
combination therapy (28% vs. 14%).  Peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, and proteinuria were 
observed  more  frequently  in patients receiving combination therapy than  in  patients receiving 
paclitaxel alone.  

In another Phase 3 trial, patients with previously treated metastatic  breast cancer were treated 
either with capecitabine alone or in combination with bevacizumab.[48]  Although the addition 
of bevacizumab to capecitabine increased the response rate (19.8% vs. 9.1%, P=0.001), this did 
not  translate  into  improved  PFS  or  overall  survival.    Grade  4  toxicities  included  thrombotic

events, pulmonary embolism, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, and cardiomyopathy.  Also, a Phase II 
trial of bevacizumab in combination with weekly docetaxel as either first-or second-line therapy 
in patients with metastatic breast cancer demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 52% 
and a median PFS of 7.5  months.[49]  The  most common Grade 4 toxicities were pulmonary 
embolus, febrile neutropenia, and infection.  Finally, an ongoing Phase II study of docetaxel plus 
bevacizumab  in  chemotherapy  naive,  HER2-negative  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer 
demonstrated a response rate of 40% among 43 patients.  The most common Grade 3/4 adverse 
events  (AEs)  included  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  and  hypertension.[50]   By  contrast, 
single-agent  bevacizumab  has  very  modest  antitumor  activity  in  patients  with  pretreated 
metastatic breast cancer.[51]

Taken  together,  these  studies  establish  the  principle  of  using  antiangiogenic  therapy  in 
combination  with  cytotoxics  in  the  treatment  of  metastatic  breast  cancer.    Thus,  there  is  a 
compelling rationale to explore the activity of IMC-1121B in this patient population.

IMC-1121B

1.6
IMC-1121B  is  a  recombinant  human  monoclonal  antibody  (MAb)  of  the  immunoglobulin  G, 
subclass  1  (IgG1)  that  specifically  binds  to  the  extracellular  domain  of  VEGFR-2  with  high 
affinity.  This antibody potently blocks the binding of the VEGF ligand to VEGFR-2, inhibits 
VEGF-stimulated  activation  of  both  VEGFR-2  and  p44/p42  MAP  kinases,  and  neutralizes 
VEGF-induced mitogenesis of human endothelial cells.

IMC-1121B antibodies were shown to block the interaction of VEGF and VEGFR-2 (with an 
IC50 of approximately 1 nM), and to inhibit VEGF-stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells 
and VEGF-induced migration of human leukemia cells.[52],[53]

Overall, the preclinical pharmacodynamic data demonstrate that IMC-1121B binds specifically 
and with  high affinity to the VEGFR-2 and  is capable of  inhibiting certain  in  vitro biological 
processes  including  VEGF/VEGFR-2  interaction,  VEGF-stimulated  VEGFR-2  activation, 
proliferation of human endothelial cells, VEGF-induced migration of human leukemia cells, and 
VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 
porcine aortic endothelial cells engineered to overexpress VEGFR-2.[53]  These  processes are

most  likely  involved  in  tumor  angiogenesis.    Potent  angiogenic  and  antitumor  effects  are 
observed when an antibody counterpart to IMC-1121B that targets murine VEGFR-2, DC101, is 
administered to mice bearing syngeneic tumors or human tumor xenografts.  Two subcutaneous 
xenograft  models established with the  human  breast cancer cell  lines MDA-MB-435LM2 and 
MX-1 compared DC101 and sunitinib alone and in combination with docetaxel.  Treatment with 
DC101  demonstrated significantly  greater  antitumor  effects  than  sunitinib,  when  both 
compounds  were given  alone  or  in  combination  with  5  mg/kg  of  docetaxel  in  the 
MDA-MB-435LM2  breast  cancer  model (Figure  1).[54]   In  both  models,  the  combination  of 
DC101  and  docetaxel  (5  and  12  mg/kg)  was  active in  suppressing  tumor  growth.[54],[55]  
Therefore, the results of these preclinical studies support the administration of IMC-1121B to 
patients for the treatment of breast tumors.

MDA-MB-435LM2 model

Two  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies  (5  weeks  and  39  weeks)  were  conducted  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys.  In the 5-week repeat-dose study, IMC-1121B was administered I.V. at doses of 0, 4, 
12, or 40 mg/kg.  There were no IMC-1121B-related effects seen in clinical signs, body weights, 
food  consumption,  urinalysis,  blood  pressure,  hematology,  coagulation,  and  serum  chemistry.  
There  were  also  no  IMC-1121B-related  effects  found  at  gross  pathology  evaluation.

Histopathology  evaluation  revealed  focal  muscle  fiber  degeneration  and  mononuclear  cell 
infiltration  in  skeletal  muscle  (quadriceps  femoris)  in  test  article-treated  animals  only.    These 
effects were concluded to be not treatment-related due to the focal nature of the lesions and the 
low  incidence  in  females.    The  IMC-1121B  injection  sites  had  mild  reactions  consisting  of 
mononuclear cells or mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells in perivascular areas.  Based on 
the results of this study, I.V. administration of IMC-1121B was well tolerated at dose levels from 
4 to 40  mg/kg  for 4 doses and the NOEL (no-observable-effect  level)  in this  study was ≥ 40 
mg/kg, the highest dose administered.

In the 39-week repeat-dose study, IMC-1121B was administered via I.V. infusion at dose levels 
of 5, 16, and 50 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkeys for 11 weekly doses over 12 weeks (females 
only) or weekly for 39 weeks (males and females) of study.  There were no IMC-1121B-related 
effects  noted  in  animals  treated  at  up  to  50  mg/kg  for  12  weeks  of  study.    Thickening  and 
osteochondropathy of the epiphyseal growth plate was noted at 5 mg/kg and above in animals 
treated for 39 weeks.  This was an anticipated mechanism-related effect.  Treatment with IMC-
1121B resulted in renal toxicity at the 16 and 50 mg/kg dose levels after 39 weeks.  In addition, 
clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters indicated that the renal toxicity had manifested at 16 
mg/kg and 50 mg/kg after 26 weeks.  A NOEL of IMC-1121B could not be established when 
administered I.V. once a week for 39 weeks in male or female cynomolgus monkeys.

Two Phase 1 clinical studies have been conducted in the United States to evaluate the safety and 
antitumor effects of IMC-1121B administered at doses ranging from 2 to 16 mg/kg every week 
(CP12-0401) and at doses ranging from 6 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 15 or 20 mg/kg every 
3 weeks (CP12-0402) in patients with advanced cancer.  Both studies enrolled patients in all dose 
cohorts and are closed to enrollment.[56]

There are multiple Phase 1-3 studies that are ongoing or completed.  More information about the 
known  and  expected  benefits,  risks,  and  reasonably  anticipated  adverse  events  (AEs)  may  be 
found  in  the  Investigator’s  Brochure  (IB).    Information  on  AEs  expected  to  be  related  to the 
study  drug  may  be  found  in  Section  7  (Development  Core  Safety  Information)  of  the  IB.

1.7

Taxanes

The  taxanes  docetaxel  and  paclitaxel  have  emerged  as  among  the  most  active  compounds 
introduced in the last decade for the treatment of breast cancer.  In the clinic, the taxanes are now 
standard  therapy  in  metastatic  breast  cancer  after  prior  chemotherapy  (usually  anthracycline 
failure).    Although  the  2 compounds  share  some  characteristics  such  as  similar  chemical 
structures, binding to tubulin, stabilization of microtubules, and G2M cell cycle arrest, they are 
also  very  different  both  in  preclinical  profile  and  clinical  activity.    In  early  clinical  studies, 
docetaxel demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics  and  less  schedule dependence than paclitaxel.  
The primary clinical differences are related to their different efficacy-toxicity ratio in relation to 
dose and schedule.  The dose-limiting toxicity for both drugs is neutropenia, but differences in 
nonhematologic toxicities are evident.  Fluid retention and fatigue are observed with docetaxel 
administration  and  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  neurotoxicity  are  seen  more  frequently  with 
paclitaxel.

Paclitaxel received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1994 for the second-line 
treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination therapy for metastatic disease or relapse 
within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy.  The approval was based on data from 471 patients 
enrolled in a Phase III dose-randomized study, 135 to 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.  The ORR was 
26% with a median duration of response of 8.1 months and a median survival of 11.7 months.  
Three Phase II open-label supportive trials conducted in pretreated patients with advanced breast 
cancer  utilized  higher  doses  and  different  schedules.    In  2 of  the  studies,  paclitaxel  was 
administered as a 24-hour infusion at initial doses of 200 or 250 mg/m2 with response rates of 
52% and 57%, respectively.  In the third study, paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) was administered as a 24-
hour infusion with a response rate of 30% in this extensively pretreated patient population.

Docetaxel  received  approval  in  the  US  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally-advanced  or 
metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy and in the European Union (EU) for 
the  treatment  of  patient  with  locally-advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of

cytotoxic  chemotherapy (previous  therapy  should  have  included  an  anthracycline).    The 
approvals were based on data from 2 large randomized trials conducted in 718 patients and from 
6 single arm studies involving a total of 309 patients.  In Phase II studies, docetaxel 75 and 100 
mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks to patients with metastatic breast cancer had response rates of 
approximately 38-68% as first-line chemotherapy.[57]  In Phase III trials, single-agent docetaxel 
therapy in previously untreated patients with metastatic breast cancer resulted in response rates 
of 30-48%.[58]  In a recently published study conducted in patients with advanced breast cancer 
as second-line treatment, a direct relationship between the dose of docetaxel and tumor response 
was  observed  across  the  dose  range  of  60  to  100  mg/m2 every  3 weeks.[59]   Toxicities  were 
related to dose, including neutropenia, fluid retention, and infection. 

The first randomized clinical trial to directly compare docetaxel to paclitaxel as monotherapy at 
the approved doses and schedules for patients with advanced breast cancer following progression 
on  an  anthracycline-containing  chemotherapy  regimen  was  recently  published.[60]   Patients 
received either docetaxel (100 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) on Day 1, every 21 days.  The 
median overall survival (15.4 vs. 12.7 months, P=0.03) and median time to progression ([TTP], 
5.7 vs. 3.6 months, P < 0.0001) were significantly longer for docetaxel than paclitaxel, and the 
ORR (32%  vs. 25%, P=0.10)  was  higher  for  docetaxel.    The  incidence  of  treatment-related 
nonhematologic  and  hematologic  toxicities  was  greater  for  docetaxel  than  for  paclitaxel; 
however, the quality of life scores were not statistically different between the treatment groups 
over  time.    Patients  in  the  docetaxel  arm  also  received  more  cycles  of  therapy.    Therefore, 
docetaxel  demonstrated  superior  clinical  benefit  in  terms  of  survival  and  time  to  disease 
progression with manageable toxicities.

Docetaxel also has anti-angiogenic properties in vitro that are dose-dependent with anticipated 
plasma  concentrations  that can  be achieved  in  humans.[61]   The  in  vitro  cytotoxic  doses  of 
docetaxel against cancer cells are in the same range as the doses required to inhibit endothelial 
cell proliferation.[62]  Moreover, in an in vivo breast cancer model evaluating the effect of the 
paracrine release of VEGF on the efficacy of docetaxel, treatment with a VEGF antibody plus 
docetaxel modulated angiogenesis in the mice with VEGF-transfected cells slightly better than 
single  agent  docetaxel, and  VEGF  blockage  overcame  the  resistance  to  docetaxel  induced  by

VEGF.    Taken  together,  these  results  suggest  that  the  addition  of  docetaxel  to  an  agent  that 
specifically inhibits angiogenesis may be a promising theme for new clinical studies. 

Summary of Rationale

1.8
Inhibition of angiogenesis is considered a promising approach to the treatment of cancer.  VEGF 
is an important regulator of the angiogenesis process and appears to be a promising therapeutic 
target in metastatic breast cancer.  The manner in which this molecule interacts with the tumor-
associated vascular  endothelium  is  key to  cancer progression.    VEGF  is  overexpressed 
throughout  breast  cancer  tissue  and  may  be  the  most  important  tumor  angiogenic  factor.    A 
positive correlation has been found between VEGF levels and poor clinical outcome, including 
patient survival. 

Disabling the function of the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway via a number of approaches, including 
anti-VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies, and small molecule VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors, has been shown to inhibit new blood vessel formation and tumor growth in a variety 
of animal models.  Treatment with anti-VEGF agents inhibits the growth of human breast tumor 
xenografts in animals.  Thus, therapeutic agents that interfere with the function of VEGF and its 
receptors represent rational approaches to antitumor therapy.

IMC-1121B is a recombinant human MAb that specifically binds to the extracellular domain of 
VEGFR-2 with high affinity.  This antibody potently blocks the binding of the VEGF ligand to 
VEGFR-2, a critical mediator of VEGF function.  Phase I studies completed or currently nearing 
completion  have  demonstrated  safety  and  tolerability  at  clinically  relevant  doses,  with 
preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy.  At least 4 patients have experienced confirmed partial 
responses.  In addition, a larger number of patients have experienced stable disease of prolonged 
durations.    Some  patients  have  also  experienced  clinical  benefit  manifested  by  reductions  in 
analgesic use or fluid retention.  Generally, single agent IMC-1121B has been well tolerated, and 
no unpredictable safety signals have been noted.

Nonclinical data obtained  from a  murine BxPC-3 xenograft  model have demonstrated that the 
efficacy  of  DC101,  a  murine  analogue  to  IMC-1121B,  was  evident  in  vivo  at  trough 
concentrations of 20 µg/mL.  The target serum concentration for IMC-1121B is hypothesized to

be one that maintains IMC-1121B at trough plasma concentrations at ≥ 20 µg/mL.  Preliminary 
pharmacokinetic  data  from  studies  CP12-0401  and  CP12-0402,  for  patients  treated  on  the 
weekly- and  every  other  week-regimens indicate  that  the  minimum  20 µg/mL  target  trough 
concentrations are attainable.  In CP12-0604, a Phase 2 study, IMC-1121B was administered at a 
dose of 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  Preliminary data from this study suggest that the 20-µg/mL 
minimum  trough  concentration  can  be  readily  achieved.    This  is  evidenced  by  Cmin
concentrations in Arm B (IMC-1121B monotherapy) that were above the 20-µg/mL target trough 
concentration following the third infusion (ie, Cycle 3).  Furthermore, the Cmin concentrations in 
Arm B increased following the second infusion (Cycle 2) and stabilized by the fourth infusion 
(Cycle  4),  suggesting  that the  concentrations  reach  steady-state  by  the  fourth  infusion.    Thus, 
these preliminary data from the CP12-0604 study support the dose the regimen of IMC-1121B
proposed for the current study, ie, 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks.

Based on the above Phase III study which compared docetaxel and paclitaxel [60], ImClone has 
chosen  docetaxel  as  the  chemotherapy  backbone  at  a  dose  of  75  mg/m2 administered  every 
3 weeks. Although this study utilized  a docetaxel dose of 100  mg/m2,  it was associated with 
considerable toxicity.  The impression that this dose of docetaxel is rather toxic is reinforced by 
another  previously  mentioned  randomized  Phase  III  study  that  compared  different  doses  of 
docetaxel.[59]   This study revealed that a dose of 75 mg/m2 is as effective as the higher dose of 
100  mg/m2 in  the  intent-to-treat  population  and  considerably  less  toxic.    Accordingly,  the 
National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  in  Oncology  includes 
75 mg/m2 docetaxel  among  its  choices  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  breast  cancer.    Taken 
together, it is reasonably  clear that docetaxel  is at least as effective as paclitaxel, and that the 
dose of 75 mg/m2 is at least as potent as the higher dose while being considerably more tolerable.  
Therefore, particularly where long-term therapy is anticipated, the risk-benefit axis would seem 
to favor strongly a docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m2.

By comparison, the “weekly” paclitaxel  schedule used  in the ECOG E2100 study will  lead to 
greater clinic visits for patients and may be less convenient than an every 3-week schedule of the 
IMC-1121B-docetaxel.    Hence,  the  latter  will  provide  another  regimen  with  a  convenient 
schedule to patients with breast cancer.

The above considerations lay a firm foundation for the proposed trial.  In particular, the robust 
preclinical data of DC101 in a variety of tumor models (including breast cancer), the superiority 
of DC101  in preclinical comparisons against a  small  molecule with  inhibitory activity toward 
VEGFR-2, the established activity of docetaxel in breast cancer, the proof-of-principle provided 
by the combination of bevacizumab and paclitaxel in a similar population of patients with breast 
cancer, the expected lack of overlapping toxicities between docetaxel and IMC-1121B, and the 
potential superiority of IMC-1121B suggested by the emerging data from Phase I studies suggest 
that the combination of docetaxel and IMC-1121B may constitute a valuable regimen for patients 
with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Study Population

3 PATIENT SELECTION
3.1
Female  patients  at  least  18  years  of  age  with  histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed, 
HER2-negative breast adenocarcinoma that is metastatic or locally-recurrent and inoperable with 
curative intent will be randomized.  Patients may not have received chemotherapy for metastatic
or locally-recurrent, inoperable breast cancer.

It is anticipated that 1113 patients will  be randomized with 371 patients  in the docetaxel plus 
placebo  arm and  742 patients in  the  docetaxel  plus  IMC-1121B  arm.    There  will  be 
approximately 230 centers  in  North  and South  America,  Europe,  Asia,  Middle  East,  Africa,
Australia, and New Zealand.  If patient recruitment at any medical center  is rapid, enrollment 
will be limited to maximum of 10% of the total enrollment.  The enrollment or accrual rate will 
be  monitored  continuously  in  a  blinded  form  to  assess  whether  a  sample  size  adjustment  is 
required.  The adjustment, if any, will not require an adjustment of the significance value since 
no test will be performed.

Patient Enrollment

Patients will be recruited from a population of breast cancer patients treated at the investigational 
centers.    Each  patient  or  patient’s  representative  must  sign  a  current,  Institutional  Review 
Board/approving  Ethics  Committee  (IRB/aEC)-approved  informed  consent  form  prior  to any 
study-specific procedures  not  considered  standard  practice  by  the  institution  are  performed.  
Specific instructions for the central enrollment, registration, and randomization procedures will 
be provided to the site in a separate procedure manual.

Randomization  is  stratified  by  prior  taxane  therapy  (yes/no),  visceral  metastasis  (yes/no), 
hormone receptor status (positive vs. negative/unknown), and geographical region (the Americas
vs. Europe/Australia/New Zealand vs. Asia/Middle East/Africa).

3.5 Registration
Any patient signing the Informed Consent Form must be registered in the study.  The registration 
will be performed by the investigator or designee through the Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS).  The registration procedure is detailed in the IWRS user manual. Upon registration, the 
patient will be assigned a unique study identification number.  The study identification number

Emergency Unblinding Procedures*

3.7
In blinded studies, the identity of the assigned treatment arm will be contained in the IWRS.  The 
investigator and authorized designees will be provided with a unique access code to access the 
IWRS to obtain unblinding information.  This code is unique to the individual and must not be 
shared.

Emergency unblinding can only occur for medical reasons where the identity of the test drug is 
integral to the treatment for the adverse event. The occurrence of a serious adverse event should 
not routinely precipitate the immediate unblinding of an investigational product label.

Emergency unblinding can occur upon request of a physician (study site Investigator   or  any 
other physician), Lilly GPS (Global Patient Safety), or ImClone Medical Monitor for a particular 
patient at any time during the study to protect the welfare of a study subject provided that all the 
following criteria are met:

study treatment

 Study subject experiences a serious adverse event (SAE)
 The SAE must be considered to be at least possibly related to the 
 Knowledge of the treatment arm  is  medically  necessary to provide 
treatment for the SAE (this criterion will not apply to any requesters 
other than the medical team managing the patient)

Emergency unblinding at a study site for any reason other than those above will be considered a 
protocol deviation and must be well documented by the study site.  Unblinding for any reason 
should be well documented.

In addition, emergency unblinding can be requested by an IRB/CEC or a Health Authority.

Patient  treatment  must  remain  blinded even if  the  patient  is  removed  from  the  study  due  to
disease progression.  Study treatment is not to be unblinded for progressive disease.

If  unblinding  is  necessary  in  an  emergency  situation,  the  principal  investigator  is  strongly 
encouraged  to  contact  ImClone  before  unblinding  any  patient’s  treatment  assignment.    The 
Emergency Unblinding Request Form should be used for this purpose.  If this is not feasible, the

ImClone LLC

investigator   must contact ImClone within 24 hours following unblinding and must document 
the unblinding in the patient’s records.

If emergency unblinding occurs at the site level by the principal investigator or his/her designee, 
the study therapy must be discontinued and the patient must be removed from the study.

Unblinding  can  occur  for  the  purposes  of  Regulatory  Reporting.    This  unblinding  will  not 
necessitate patient discontinuation unless the  blind break  information  is revealed to any  study 
related  personnel  other  than  the  Pharmacovigilance  team. In  addition,  all  patients  will  be 
unblinded in the extension lead period (see Section 4.4).

If the IWRS is not accessible for any reason the Investigator should call the 24-hour IWRS 
helpdesk to perform the unblinding:

South  America,  Europe,  Asia,  Middle  East,  Africa,  Australia, and  New  Zealand: 

United States and Canada: 

 or

enter the extension lead period.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN

4
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This  Phase  III,  multicenter,  multinational,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group, 
randomized study will compare a 2 drug regimen of IMC-1121B plus docetaxel to placebo plus 
docetaxel in previously-untreated patients with HER2-negative, unresectable, locally-recurrent or 
metastatic breast cancer.  Patients, medical and ancillary medical staff, and the sponsor and its 
designees will  be  blinded  as  to  the  treatment  assignment  of  each  patient.    IMC-1121B  and 
placebo will appear identical.  Randomization will be stratified by prior taxane therapy (yes/no), 
visceral  metastasis  (yes/no),  hormone  receptor  status  (positive  vs. negative/unknown),  and
geographical  region  (the  Americas vs.  Europe/Australia/New  Zealand vs.  Asia/Middle 
East/Africa).   On  Day  1 (±  3  days)  of  each 21-day  cycle,  patients  will  receive  docetaxel  75 
mg/m2 as an approximately 1-hour intravenous (I.V.) infusion followed by either IMC-1121B 10 
mg/kg or placebo 10 mg/kg as an approximately 1-hour I.V. infusion.  Each cycle  is repeated 
every  21 days.    All  patients  should  be  premedicated  with  oral  corticosteroids  (such  as 
dexamethasone 16 mg/day for 3 days starting 1 day prior to each docetaxel infusion to reduce the 
severity of fluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions) or parenteral corticosteroids according 
to institutional guidelines and current standard practice.  Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 
(G-CSF)  may  be  used  as  suggested  by  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology
guidelines.[63]

Patients are treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria 
are  met. All  patients  will  be  followed  for  survival  at  regularly  scheduled  intervals  (every  6 
months)  until  death  or  until  the  extension  period  begins  (as  defined  in  Section 4.5). The 
extension period will  begin  after study completion (see Section 4.5).  In  the extension period, 
survival follow-up will be discontinued. 

Since  the  study  failed to  meet  the  primary  endpoint,  data  collection  will  be  reduced  and  an 
extension lead period will begin for patients still under study treatment (see Section 4.4).  All 
patients  will  be  informed  of  pertinent  study  updates  and  changes.    At  the  beginning  of  the 
extension  lead  period,  patients  under  study  treatment (IMC-1121B/Placebo plus  docetaxel) or 
IMC-1121B/docetaxel  only)  will  be  unblinded. Once  unblinded,  patients  will  be  given  the

treatment

study 

Investigators should consult the locally approved docetaxel prescribing information for complete 
prescribing  information  (including  warnings,  precautions,  contraindications,  adverse  reactions, 
and dose modification) and follow institutional procedures for the administration of docetaxel.

Tumor  response  and  progression  will  be  evaluated  both  by  the  investigator     and  by  an 
Independent Review Committee (IRC), using RECIST guidelines [1] which have been modified 
based on current practices of the medical community.[2]  The  objective of the IRC is to assess 
radiographic response and date of progression for all patients enrolled in this study.  The primary
endpoint (PFS) and  the  secondary  endpoints (TTP,  duration  of  response,  and  ORR) will  be 
analyzed according to the assessment  made  by the  investigator.  A secondary  analysis will  be 
based  on  the  corresponding  assessments  obtained  by  the  IRC.  More  details  about  the 
responsibilities of the IRC are presented in the IRC Charter.   

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established prior to the inclusion of 
the first patient in the trial.  The IDMC will meet at least twice per year, and when 50 and 150 
patients have received at least 2 cycles of study drug, died, or discontinued study drug to perform 
an  unblinded  review  of  the  safety  data  to  minimize  patient  exposure  to  any  unexpected  or 
unnecessary  risks.   Fut ility  analyses will  be conducted  when  25% and  40%  of  the  expected 
number of PFS events are observed, approximately 200 and 318 PFS events, respectively.  The 
IDMC will recommend early discontinuation of the study or continuation of the study for full 
patient  accrual.    If  the  IDMC  recommends  early  discontinuation  of  the  study  for  futility, no 
additional  patients  will  be  enrolled,  however,  patients  currently  enrolled  in  the  study  will  be 
followed  for  survival.   Upon  completion  of  the  primary  endpoint analyses  for  the  796  PFS 
events,  the  IDMC  will  no  longer  be  needed,  as  the  Sponsor  will  have  been  unblinded. The 
Sponsor will be responsible for future safety reviews.  The IDMC will be decommissioned at that 
time.

Upon notification of pending study completion, investigational sites will be given adequate time 
to collect final clinical data and complete all required documentation.  

The study will be discontinued if ImClone/Lilly or the Steering Committee judges it necessary 
for  medical,  safety,  regulatory,  ethical,  or  other  reasons  consistent  with  applicable  laws, 
regulations, and GCP.

Extension Lead Period

4.4
Since the study failed to meet the primary endpoint, an extension lead period will be added to 
allow  patients  still  on  study  treatment  and  experiencing  ongoing  clinical  benefit  to  continue 
receiving study treatment until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or when 
other withdrawal criteria are met.  At the beginning of the extension lead period, all patients who 
are on study treatment (IMC-1121B/placebo plus docetaxel or IMC-1121B/docetaxel only) will 
be unblinded.  During the extension lead period placebo will not be provided and data collection 
will be reduced.   Patients must sign an addendum informed consent form (ICF) before entering 
the extension lead period. In case a patient under study treatment does not consent to enter the 
extension lead period, the patient will be withdrawn from study treatment and will be followed 
for 30-day safety and survival.  

The extension lead period includes:

o Study therapy administration:  During the extension lead period, patients still 
under study treatment (IMC-1121B/Placebo plus docetaxel or IMC-1121B/ 
docetaxel only) will be unblinded.  Once unblinded, patients will be given the 
opportunity to continue active study treatment upon request / investigator 
decision.  During the extension lead period, placebo however will no longer be 
administered, and crossover will not be permitted.  Patients who are withdrawn 
from study drug (IMC-1121B/Placebo) can continue to be treated with docetaxel 
until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or when other 
withdrawal criteria are met.

o 30-day Safety follow-up:  Begins after the investigator decides that the patient 

will no longer continue study treatment (IMC-1121B plus docetaxel or 
IMC-1121B/docetaxel only) in the extension lead period and lasts approximately 
30 days after the last study treatment administration.  Patients who are in the 30-
day Safety follow-up when the extension lead period begins will continue in 
safety follow-up until the 30-day safety follow-up visit is completed.

(see Section 7.4.2.2).  During the extension lead period, AEs, SAEs, and study treatment (IMC-
1121B plus docetaxel, IMC-1121B/docetaxel only) exposure will be reported on the CRF for all 
patients.    Serious  adverse  events  will  also  be  reported  to  the  TRIO  Safety  Officer  (see 
Section 8.9).  In the event that an SAE occurs, ImClone/Lilly or TRIO may request additional 
information (such as local laboratory results, concomitant medications, and hospitalizations) in 
order to evaluate the reported SAE. Blood samples for PK and immunogenicity analysis will be 
collected in the event of an infusion-related reaction and during the 30-day Safety follow-up.

Investigators  should  perform  any  other  standard  and/or  protocol  procedures  and  tests  (see 
Sections  6 and  7.2)  needed to  treat  and  evaluate  patients.    ImClone/Lilly  or  TRIO will  not 
routinely collect the results of these assessments.

4.5

Extension Period

The  extension  period begins after  study  completion and  ends  at  the  end  of  trial.    During  the 
extension  period,  patients  still  on  study  treatment  at the  end  of  the  extension  lead  period and 
experiencing ongoing clinical benefit may continue to receive study treatment until evidence of 
disease  progression,  unacceptable  toxicity,  or  when  other  withdrawal  criteria  are  met.  
ImClone/Lilly or TRIO will notify investigators when the extension period begins. 

The extension period includes:

o Study therapy administration:  During the extension period, patients may continue 
to receive study treatment (IMC-1121B plus docetaxel or IMC1121B/docetaxel
only) until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or when other 
withdrawal criteria are met.  

o 30-day Safety follow-up:  Begins after the investigator decides that the patient 
will no longer continue study treatment (IMC-1121B plus docetaxel or IMC-
1121B/docetaxel only) in the extension period and lasts approximately 30 days 
after the last study treatment administration.  Patients who are in the 30-day 
Safety follow-up when the extension period begins will continue in safety follow-
up until the 30-day Safety follow-up visit is completed.  

During the extension period, all AEs, SAEs, and study treatment (IMC-1121B plus docetaxel or
IMC-1121B/docetaxel  only)  exposure  will  be  reported  on  the  CRF  for  all  patients.    Serious

adverse events will also be reported to the TRIO Safety Officer (see Section 8.9).  In the event 
that an SAE occurs, ImClone/Lilly or TRIO may request additional information (such as local 
laboratory  results,  concomitant  medications,  and  hospitalizations)  in  order  to  evaluate  the 
reported SAE. Blood samples for PK and immunogenicity analysis will be collected in the event 
of an infusion-related reaction and during the 30-day Safety follow-up.

Treatments Administered

5 STUDY TREATMENTS
5.1
On  Day  1 (±  3  days)  of  each 21-day  cycle,  patients  will  receive  docetaxel  75  mg/m2 as  an 
approximately one-hour     I.V. infusion followed by either study drug, IMC-1121B 10 mg/kg or 
placebo 10 mg/kg as an approximately one-hour I.V. infusion.  Each cycle is repeated every 21 
days.   An  infusion  in  a  cycle  may  occur  ± 3  days  (for  such  logistical  reasons  as holidays, 
scheduling vacations, etc).  However, early dosing or delays in dosing must be well documented 
in the patient’s source document. Treatment will continue until there is evidence of progressive 
disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal  criteria  are  met.  Patients who discontinue 
study treatment with either IMC-1121B or placebo may continue to receive docetaxel.  Similarly, 
patients  who  discontinue  docetaxel  therapy  may  continue  to  receive  either  IMC-1121B  or 
placebo, whichever the patient was randomized to receive.

5.1.1

Docetaxel

Investigators  should  consult  the  locally  approved  prescribing  information  for  administration
instructions.  Review your locally approved package insert for the availability of either the one-
vial or two-vial formulations.  The use of gloves is recommended for handling docetaxel.

The final docetaxel dilution for infusion should be administered I.V. at a dose of 75 mg/m2 as 1-
hour   infusion on Day 1 every 21 days.  The dose of docetaxel will be calculated based on the 
patient’s baseline body surface area.  This dose will be recalculated if there is a 10% change in 
body weight from baseline.

Fully  prepared  docetaxel  must  be  infused  in  accordance  to  the  timeframe  set  forth  in  your 
country’s approved package insert.  The final docetaxel dilution should be administered I.V. as a 
1-hour    infusion under ambient room temperature and lighting conditions. 

All patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone 16 mg/day 
for 3 days starting 1 day prior to each docetaxel infusion to reduce the severity of fluid retention 
and hypersensitivity reactions) or parenteral corticosteroids according to institutional guidelines 
and current standard practice.

5.1.2

IMC-1121B or Placebo

Patients  will  receive  IMC-1121B or  placebo (study  drug)  I.V. 10  mg/kg  via  infusion  over 
approximately 1 hour.  The dose of IMC-1121B or placebo will be dependent upon the patient’s 
baseline body weight in kilograms.  This dose will be recalculated if there is a 10% change in 
body weight from baseline.  The dose of IMC-1121B or placebo should be aseptically withdrawn 
from the vial and transferred to a sterile ethylene vinyl acetate, polyolefin, polyvinyl chloride, or 
AVIVA I.V. bag, or an evacuated USP Type II (or local equivalent) glass I.V. container.  For 
dose  volumes  <  250  mL,  a  sufficient  quantity  of  sterile  normal  saline  (0.9%  weight/volume) 
solution  must  be  added  (or  removed  in  the  case  of  a  pre-filled  bag  such  as  AVIVA)  to  the 
container to make the total volume 250 mL.  The infusion should be delivered in approximately 
60 minutes. For dose volumes > 250 mL, the addition of sterile normal saline is not required.  
The infusion rate should not exceed 25 mg/minute.  The container should be gently inverted to 
ensure  adequate  mixing.   Different  drug  product  lots or  formulations  must  not  be  mixed  in  a 
single infusion.  An infusion set (non-vented for plastic or vented for glass container) equipped 
with  a  down-stream  in-line  0.2-µm  or  0.22-µm protein-sparing  filter  is  required  for 
administration  of  IMC-1121B  or  placebo.   The  infusion  tubing  must  be  flushed  with  normal 
saline  to  ensure  delivery  of  the  calculated  dose.  DO  NOT  FREEZE  IMC-1121B OR 
PLACEBO.  Refer to the IB for detailed storage information.

IMC-1121B or placebo should be administered following docetaxel administration.  

5.2

Treatment Compliance

Trained  medical  personnel  will  administer  IMC-1121B,  placebo, and  docetaxel  as  specified 
above in Section 5.1. Treatment compliance is monitored by the review of drug accountability 
records (Section 5.5) and study drug administration data recorded in the patient’s medical record 
and CRF.

5.3

Packaging and Labeling

5.3.1

Docetaxel

Investigators  should  consult  the  locally  approved  prescribing  information  for  packaging  and 
labeling instructions.  Docetaxel is supplied in a single-dose vial as a sterile, pyrogen-free, non-

aqueous, viscous solution with an accompanying sterile, non-pyrogenic, diluent (ethanol in water 
for injection) vial.  Depending on local approvals, docetaxel is available in 2 concentrations: a 
two-vial formulation (20 mg/0.5 mL and 80 mg/2 mL) and a one-vial formulation (20 mg/1 mL 
and 80 mg/4 mL).

The two-vial and one-vial formulation contain the same excipients (ethanol, polysorbate 80 and 
citric acid) and in the infusion solution the same quantity of polysorbate 80; however, the only 
difference is the quantity of ethanol (2.2-fold higher in the one-vial formulation).

5.3.2

IMC-1121B/Placebo

IMC-1121B and placebo drug product are sterile preservative-free, injectable liquids in single-
use 50-mL vials containing 500 mg/50 mL IMC-1121B in a histidine-buffered formulation at a
final concentration of 10 mg/mL or placebo containing only the histidine-buffered formulation 
vehicle.  Each vial is packaged and labeled in accordance with local regulations.

5.4

Storage

5.4.1

Required Radiological Imaging

 Chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis:    computed  tomography  (CT)  scan  or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of chest, abdomen and pelvis.  It 
is  recommended  that  CT  imaging  of  the  abdomen/pelvis  be 
performed with intravenous contrast whenever possible. 

 Brain:  CT scan or MRI (at baseline and as clinically indicated)
 Bone:  whole body  bone scintigraphy (at baseline and as clinically 
indicated for response confirmation); PET scans or skeletal surveys 
are  permitted if  bone  scintigraphy  is  not  available.    In  the  case  of 
positive bone scintigraphy (or PET scans or skeletal surveys, if bone 
scintigraphy is not available), radiographs (x-rays), MRI or CT scans 
of  abnormal  regions  suspicious  for  bone  metastases  should  be 
performed to confirm bone metastases.

Note: All CT examinations of the body (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) will  be performed using 
modern spiral (helical) or multidetector CT scanners.  Body images will be reconstructed at no 
greater than 8.0 mm intervals.  Smaller body parts such as brain, neck, spine, and extremities will 
be  reconstructed  at  5.0  mm  intervals.  In  the  event  spiral  (helical) or  multidetector  CT  is  not 
available, conventional CT section thickness of body images of < 10 mm and smaller body parts, 
brain, neck, and spine of < 5.0 mm will be used.

Additional imaging assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator.

Note: To  ensure  comparability,  baseline  imaging  studies  and  subsequent  follow-up  imaging 
studies  used  to  assess  response  must  be  performed  using  identical  techniques  throughout  the 
study.

Skin  Lesions - documentation  of  skin  lesions  (including  subcutaneous  skin  lesions) by  color 
photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion.

Tumor  Measurements/Disease  Response  Assessment – the  determination  of  unidimensional 
measurements  and  disease  response  as  defined  in  Section  11,  Criteria  for  Tumor  Response 
Evaluation.

Quality  of  Life - utilizing  the  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy - Breast (FACT-B)
questionnaire (Version 4.0).[64]  Quality of life questionnaires will be completed by the patients

and considered as source data.  Only patients for whom there are validated translations in which 
they are fluent will complete the FACT-B.

6.8 Other Study Procedures
Non-pharmacogenetic or biomarker samples (blood samples, tumor samples or any components 
from them) may be collected to be used now or in the future for research   to  specify the drug 
target,  disease  process,  pathways  associated  with  disease  state,  mechanism  of  action  of  IMC-
1121B, research methods and/or validating diagnostic tools or assay(s) related to breast cancer.  

6.8.1

Immunogenicity

Blood samples for the determination of anti-IMC-1121B antibodies will be collected for all study 
patients.  Detailed instructions for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping the samples will 
be provided in a separate procedure manual.  All analyses of these serum samples for anti-IMC-
1121B antibodies will occur following unblinding of the study.  If antibodies against IMC-1121B 
are detected, the patient’s serum IMC-1121B concentration will be analyzed to determine if there 
is any alteration in IMC-1121B pharmacokinetics.  IMC-1121B drug levels from patients who 
have  received  IMC-1121B  (revealed  following  unblinding  of  the  study)  and  who  had  no 
detectable serum antibodies against IMC-1121B will be used as the reference population for this 
comparison.  Serum IMC 1121B levels will be determined from the same blood draws used for 
anti-IMC-1121B antibody assessment.

For all study patients, the pre-treatment (baseline) immunogenicity sample will also be used to 
assess potentially relevant markers including, but not limited to VEGF, soluble VEGFR-1 and 
soluble VEGFR-2.

6.8.2

Change in Circulating Tumor Cells

Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of circulating tumor cells.  Detailed instructions 
for  collecting,  processing,  storing,  and  shipping  the  samples  will  be  provided  in  a  separate 
procedure manual.

6.9 Optional Study Procedures
For patients who consent to the optional procedures, specimens will be collected when available, 
as specified in Section 7. The analyses and storage of samples described in this section will be 
under the responsibility of a central laboratory.

6.9.1

Tumor Specimen Collection

Tumor  Tissue  Submission – previously  archived  tumor  tissue  from  either  the  primary  or 
metastatic tumor (paraffin block or 20 unstained slides), if available, will be collected prior to 
receiving first dose of study drug and stored at a secure central laboratory.  Tissue samples will 
be kept at a central laboratory for a non-limited period.  Study centers will be notified at the time 
of  destruction.    Tissue  will  be  kept  with  the  intention  to  perform  tests  as  new  techniques, 
research  tools,  and  biomarkers  become  available.    Information  on  specimen  handling/specific 
analysis of biopsy material will be provided in a separate procedure manual.

On-Study Tumor Tissue Submission - If at any time during the study tumor tissue is obtained 
through a biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or resection   as  routine clinical care, a portion of the 
sample for analysis of potentially relevant surrogate biomarkers is requested.

6.9.2 Whole Blood Sample Collection

 
 

6.9.2.2

Genetic Variations

Whole blood samples will be collected to explore the effect of genetic variation on therapeutic 
efficacy  and/or safety.  Gene  categories  may  include tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, cell 
adhesion, invasion and metastasis genes, genes involved in regulating cell growth and cell cycle, 
immune  function-related and tumor antigen genes, drug metabolism and transport gene, genes 
involved in angiogenesis and viral elements associated with cancer.  Blood samples will be kept 
with  the  intention  to  perform  tests  as new  techniques,  research  tools,  and  new  data  become

At any time prior to randomization.
The physical examination includes height (at baseline only) and weight measurements.
Includes blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and temperature.  
Vital signs will be completed before the docetaxel infusion, between the docetaxel and IMC-1121B/placebo infusion, 
and after the completion of each IMC-1121B/placebo infusion.

10 An assessment of baseline conditions and symptoms (including NCI-CTCAE  v 3.0  grading) must be performed for 

conditions present or ongoing at the time of signing the informed consent.

11 If  the  patient  has  docetaxel-related  toxicities,  perform  hematology  and  liver  function  tests  and  assess  neurological 

toxicities weekly based on toxicity.

12 All  study drug-related  AEs  will  be  followed  until  resolution,  stabilization,  returned  to  baseline,  or  are  deemed 

irreversible.

13 Concomitant medications will be recorded including any taken within 30 days prior to randomization and those taken 

during the 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

14 Regardless  of  treatment  assignment,  in  the  event  of  an  infusion  reaction,  a  blood  sample  will  be  collected  for 
immunogenicity analysis as close to the onset of the reaction as possible, at the resolution of the event, and 30 days 
following the event.

15 Regardless of treatment assignment, a blood sample for the determination of antibodies to IMC-1121B will be collected
prior  to  the  initial  infusion  (up  to  14  days  prior  to  randomization),  prior  to  the  IMC-1121B  or  placebo  infusion  in 
cycle 3, prior to the IMC -1121B or placebo infusion in cycle 5, and at the 30-day follow-up visit.

16 Urinalysis is to be performed at pretreatment, every 6 weeks while on study, at the end of therapy, and at the 30-day 

follow-up visit.  If dipstick or routine urinalysis indicates proteinuria ≥ 2+, a 24-hour urine collection must be obtained.

17 Imaging studies and tumor assessments will be performed and documented within 28 days prior to randomization and 
include a CT scan or MRI of chest, abdomen, pelvis, and brain and whole body bone scintigraphy/PET scan/skeletal 
surveys.  Patients with abnormal regions on whole body bone scintigraphy (or PET scans or skeletal surveys, if bone 
scintigraphy  is  not  available)  will  have  bone  radiographs  or  CT/MRI scans  performed  within  28  days  prior  to 
randomization to confirm bone metastases.  Skin lesions (including subcutaneous skin lesions) will be documented by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion.

18 Imaging  studies  and  tumor assessments,  including  the  documentation  of  skin  lesions  (including  subcutaneous  skin 
lesions), if applicable, by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion must be obtained every 
6 weeks  (±3  days)  until  documented  PD,  death,  or  withdrawal  for  patients  who  discontinued  study  therapy  due  to 
reasons other than PD.

19 For response confirmation.
20 For  patients  with  bone  metastases  at  baseline,  bone  radiographs  or  CT/MRI scan  must  be  obtained  every  6  weeks 
(±3 days) until documented PD, death, or withdrawal for patients who discontinued study therapy due to reasons other 
than PD.

21 Quality of life will be completed after every 4 cycles of therapy.
22 Follow-up for the collection of survival data should be attempted at 6-week intervals until disease progression and then 
every 6 months until death or until study completion (as defined in Section 4.3).  Survival data collection will continue 
until study completion (as defined in Section 4.3).   Follow-up contact may occur via telephone or clinic visit and will 
record the patients’ survival status.

23 After cycle 2 only.
24 For patients that consent to the optional procedures, previously archived tumor tissue and whole blood samples will be 

collected at pretreatment.

25 If at any time during the study tumor tissue is obtained through a biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or resection   as routine 
clinical care, a portion of the sample is requested for analysis of potentially relevant surrogate biomarkers (for patients 
that consent to the optional procedures).

26 To be collected or completed any time prior to first dose in Cycle 1.  Ideally,  the FACT-B questionnaire should be 

collected prior to randomization, however if it is missed, it can be collected prior to first dose in Cycle 1.

During the extension lead period and extension period, routine safety and efficacy monitoring, including 
radiographic  evaluation  of  disease  and  laboratory  testing,  such  as  pregnancy testing,  should  be 
continued as necessary to confirm patient eligibility to continue in the trial. The Sponsor will collect 
only data shown in this table for the extension lead period and extension period.
The 30-day safety follow-up period begins after the patient and the investigator agree to discontinue the 
patient  from  the  treatment  portion  of  the trial  and  lasts  approximately  30  days from  the  last  study 
treatment  administration.  The  30-day  safety  follow-up  visit  occurs  at  or  near  the  end  of  the  30-day 
safety follow-up period (±7 days).
All  study  drug-related  AEs  (IMC-1121B/placebo)  will  be  followed  until  resolution,  stabilization, 
returned to baseline, or  deemed irreversible.
Only concomitant medications and other procedures given to treat AEs have to be recorded in the CRF. 
Concomitant medications /Other procedures given for Prophylaxis or pre-medication do not need to be 
recorded anymore.  After the observation period (i.e. after 30 days following the last study treatment
administration),  only  concomitant  medications  /  other  procedures  given  to  treat  AEs  related to  study 
treatment (IMC-1121B/docetaxel) need to be reported in the CRF.
In  the  event  of  an  infusion-related  reaction,  blood  samples  will  be  collected  for  both  PK  and 
immunogenicity analysis as close to the onset of the reaction as possible, at the resolution of the event, 
and 30 days following the event.
At the end of the treatment period (End of Therapy).
Follow-up for the collection of survival data should be attempted every 6 months until death or until 
study completion (as defined in Section 4.3).   After that point is reached, no further follow-ups will be 
conducted.

8 ADVERSE EVENTS ASSESSMENTS
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study 
and for alerting ImClone or TRIO to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient.

The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patients during the study.  The 
investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health care option, AEs 
that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before completing the study.  The patient 
should be followed until the event is resolved or explained.  Frequency of follow-up evaluation is 
left to the discretion of the investigator.

Performing Adverse Events Assessments

8.1
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definitions of an adverse event or serious adverse event.

8.2

Importance of Adverse Event Reporting

Timely  and  complete  reporting  of  safety  information  assists  ImClone  in  identifying  any 
untoward medical occurrence, thereby allowing:  (1) protection of safety of study patients; (2) a 
greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the investigational product; (3) recognition 
of dose-related investigational product toxicity; (4) appropriate modification of study protocols; 
(5)  improvements  in  study  design  or  procedures;  and  (6) adherence  to  worldwide  regulatory 
requirements.

The ImClone clinical research physician will monitor safety data throughout the course of the 
study.

8.3 Adverse Event Definitions

8.3.1

Adverse Event   

An  AE is  defined  as  any  new  untoward  medical  occurrence  or  worsening  of  a  pre-existing 
medical  condition  in a patient administered a  medicinal product and that does not necessarily 
have  a  causal  relationship  with  this  treatment.    An  AE  can  therefore  be  any  unfavorable  and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 

Confidential

ImClone LLC

temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or marketed) product, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational or marketed) product. 

8.3.2

Serious Adverse Event

A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  

 Results in death 


Is  life-threatening (defined  as an event  in which  the patient was at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 

 Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage


Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 

hospitalization 

result 

immediately 

life-threatening  or 

Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event that may 
not  be 
in  death  or 
hospitalization  but,  based  upon  appropriate  medical  and  scientific 
judgment,  may  jeopardize  the  patient  or  may  require  intervention 
[eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes 
listed in the definition above).  Examples of such events include, but 
are not limited to, intensive treatment  in an emergency room or at 
home  for  allergic  bronchospasm;  blood  dyscrasias  or  convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.

For  reporting  purposes,  ImClone  also  considers  the  occurrences  of  pregnancy,  overdose,  drug 
dependency,  drug  misuse  (including  medication  error), and  drug  abuse,  regardless  of  adverse 
outcome, as important medical events that must be reported as SAEs, using the Serious Adverse 
Event Report (SAER) form.  In addition, investigators should consider reporting any Grade 3 or 
4 AE that occurred in study patients as an ‘important medical event’ using the SAER form, if the 
event  does  not  fulfill  any  other  seriousness  criteria.    Investigators  in  this  study  should  assign 
toxicity  grade  for  each  AE  according  to  the NCI-CTCAE  v  3.0 or  the  investigator’s  own 
assessment if the event is not listed in the NCI-CTCAE.

8.4 Assessment of Causality

Investigators  are  required  to  report  to  ImClone  or  TRIO their  assessment  of  the  potential 
relatedness of each  AE to protocol procedure, study drug and/or drug delivery system  via the 
CRF.  The following categories and definitions for assessing the causal relationship of an event

to the investigational product(s) are provided as a guide to be used for every event reported in 
ImClone clinical trials:

 Definite/Certain:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between 
the  investigational  product(s)  and  the  AE;  the  event  responds  to 
withdrawal  of  the  investigational  product(s)  (de-challenge)  and 
recurs with re-challenge when clinically feasible.
 Probable:    There  is  a  reasonable  causal  relationship  between  the 
investigational  product(s)  and  the  AE;  the  event  responds  to  de-
challenge; re-challenge is not required.
 Possible:    There  is  reasonable  causal  relationship  between  the 
investigational  product(s)  and  the  AE;  de-challenge  information  is 
lacking or unclear.
 Not  Likely:    There  is  a  temporal  relationship  to  study  drug 
administration,  but  there  is  not  a  reasonable  causal  relationship 
between the study drug and the AE.
 Unrelated:  There is not a temporal relationship to the investigational 
product(s)  administration  (too  early,  late,  or  the  investigational 
product  was  not taken)  or there  is  a  reasonable  causal  relationship 
between  another  drug,  concurrent  disease,  or  circumstance  and  the 
AE.

8.5 Collection of Safety Information

The collection of AE information should begin at the time the patient signs the informed consent 
form, and  must continue throughout the study until 30 days after the  last dose of study drug.  
This  includes  pre-existing  conditions  or  symptoms  that  worsened  during  the  study,  or  whose 
relationship  to  the  investigational  product  changed;  but  does  not  include  pre-planned
hospitalizations or procedures for pre-existing conditions.  In  addition, the  investigator should 
notify the TRIO Safety Officer from all countries of any serious adverse event or outcome that 
may occur after this time period that he/she believes to be related to study therapy.  All SAEs or 
AEs related to study drug (IMC-1121B/Placebo) must be  followed to resolution, stabilization, 
return  to  baseline,  or to the  point  when  deemed  irreversible.    An  AE  report  must  contain  the 
following 4 basic elements:  (1) an identifiable patient; (2) a suspect medicinal product; (3) an 
identifiable reporting source; and (4) an identifiable event or outcome.  All identified AEs must 
be recorded and described on the appropriate page of the CRF.  If known, the diagnosis and/or 
syndrome of  the  underlying  illness  or  disorder  should  be  recorded  rather  than the  presenting 
symptoms.  The following information should be captured for all AEs:  verbatim term, date of

onset and resolution; severity of the event (NCI-CTCAE v 3.0 grade or graded as mild [Grade 1], 
moderate  [Grade  2],  severe  [Grade  3],  very  severe/life  threatening  [Grade 4], or  death  [Grade 
5]); investigator’s opinion of the relationship of the event to study therapy (certainly/definitely, 
probably,  possibly,  unlikely,  or  not  related);  action  taken; treatment  required  for  the  AE; 
information regarding resolution/outcome; and if the AE is serious, a clear identification of the 
seriousness outcome(s) (see Section 8.9).

Disease progression without clinical  manifestation or death related to progressive disease will
not be recorded as an adverse event if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the CRF.  
Investigators should report signs and symptoms (eg. pain) whenever present that are associated 
with the progressive disease or the worsening of the existing cancer as an AE in the CRF.  If 
such  signs  and  symptoms  fulfill any  of  the  criteria  for  a  ‘’serious’’  adverse  event,  it  must  be 
reported as an SAE, using the SAE report form.  Progressive disease or worsening of the existing 
cancer must be reported as a separate SAE if the ‘’serious’’ criteria are met.  In addition, deaths 
occurring  within  30  days  of  the  last  administration  of  study  drug should  be  reported  as  SAE 
whatever the cause.  

An adverse event where there is a reasonable possibility that the event occurred purely as a result 
of the patient’s participation in the study must also be reported as an adverse event even if it is 
not related to the investigational product.

Expectedness of Adverse Events

8.6
The  IMC-1121B  Investigator’s  Brochure  will  be  updated  periodically  to  include  new  and 
relevant safety information.  Until such time that an AE becomes identified in the IMC-1121B 
Investigator’s Brochure, it should be considered unexpected, regardless of whether the AE has 
been reported in a previous Safety Update.

Information  on  serious  adverse  events  expected  in  the  study  population  independent  of  drug 
exposure and that will be assessed by the sponsor in aggregate periodically during the course of 
the trial may be found in the IB.

8.7 Clinical Significance

8.7.1

Pregnancy

WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the 
study and for up to 12 weeks after the last administration of study therapy in such a manner that 
the risk of pregnancy is minimized. 

surgical 

sterilization 

(hysterectomy,  bilateral 

WOCBP  include  any  female  who  has  experienced  menarche  and  who  has  not  undergone 
successful 
ligation,  or  bilateral 
oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive  months; or 
women on hormone replacement therapy with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone 
[FSH]  level  ≥ 35  mIU/mL).    Even  women  who  are  using  oral,  implanted,  or  injectable 
contraceptive  hormones  or  mechanical  products,  such  as  an  intrauterine  device  or  barrier 
methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides), to prevent pregnancy, are practicing abstinence, or 
whose partner is sterile (eg, vasectomy), should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

tubal 

WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent 
units of β-HCG, or in accordance with local regulations, whichever is more sensitive) within 14
days prior to randomization.  If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive study 
drug therapy and must not be randomized in the study.

Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP  must be advised of the  importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during  trial  participation  and  the  potential  risk  factors  for  an  unintentional  pregnancy.    The 
patient must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion. 

In  addition,  all  WOCBP  should  be  instructed  to  contact  the  investigator  immediately  if 
they  suspect  they  might  be  pregnant  (eg,  missed  or  late  menstrual  period)  at  any  time 
during study participation.

Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal exposure to study drug should be reported.  Data 
on  fetal  outcome  and  breast-feeding  are  collected  for  regulatory  reporting  and  drug  safety 
evaluation.  If following initiation of study therapy, it is subsequently discovered that a patient is 
pregnant  study  treatment will  be  permanently  discontinued  in  an  appropriate  manner.  
Exceptions to study treatment discontinuation may be considered for life-threatening conditions

only after consultation with the TRIO Safety Officer from all countries.  The  investigator must 
immediately notify the TRIO Safety Officer from all countries of this event.  If  following the 
discontinuation of study therapy, it is discovered that a patient may have been pregnant at the 
time of study drug exposure, including during at least 2 months after product administration, the 
investigator must immediately notify the TRIO Safety Officer from all countries of this event.

Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must be performed on the 
patient  unless  contraindicated  by  pregnancy  (eg,  x-ray  studies).    Other  appropriate  pregnancy 
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.  In addition, the investigator must report 
to the TRIO Safety Officer from all countries follow-up information regarding the course of the 
pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome.  Infants should be followed for a minimum 
of 8 weeks.

8.8 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events

All  laboratory test values captured as part of the study should  be recorded on the appropriate 
laboratory test results pages of the CRF.  In addition, in order for ImClone to collect additional 
information  about  clinically  important  laboratory  abnormalities,  at  a  minimum,  the  following 
laboratory abnormalities should be captured on the AE pages of the CRF as appropriate:

 Any laboratory test result that meets the criteria for an SAE
 Any  laboratory abnormality that required the patient to have  study 
drug discontinued, delayed, dose reduced, or interrupted
 Any  laboratory  abnormality  that  required  the  patient

to  receive 

specific corrective therapy

It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory term, will be used by 
the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus a low hemoglobin value). 

8.9 Handling of Serious Adverse Events
In  addition  to  the  information  provided  in  Section  8.5,  AEs  classified  as  “serious”  must  be 
recorded on the AE page of the CRF and require expeditious handling and reporting to the TRIO
Safety  Officer  from  all  countries  to  comply  with  regulatory  requirements.    These  SAEs  will 
include deaths, regardless of their causal relationship to investigational product.  All SAEs must 
be  reported  using  the  SAER  form.    To  the  extent  possible,  the  descriptive  terminologies  and 

Confidential

ImClone LLC

other SAE attributes entered on the SAER form should approximate similar information in the 
CRF.  The completed SAER form must be faxed to the number on the SAER form (specific for 
the site’s region) within 1 working day of the study site personnel’s initial notification/awareness 
of the event.  Duly authorized study site personnel may sign completed SAER forms; however, it 
is recommended that the investigator sign each final SAE report.

All serious AEs, whether related or unrelated to the investigational product, must be immediately 
reported to the TRIO Safety Officer from all countries by confirmed facsimile transmission or 
email, even if only limited information is available.  Overnight express mail may be used in lieu 
of facsimile.  The original SAER form must be kept on file at the study site.  Refer to the details 
directed  on  the  AE  CRF  or  in  the  Drug  Safety  Plan  included  in  the appropriate  procedural 
manual.  Study site personnel must alert ImClone or TRIO of any serious adverse event (SAE) 
within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event via a sponsor-approved method.  Alerts 
issued via telephone are to be immediately followed with official notification on study-specific 
SAE forms.  This 24-hour notification requirement refers to the initial SAE information.

Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  Thus, follow-up 
information that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (eg, 
hospital  discharge  summaries,  additional  lab  and  test  results,  autopsy  reports,  etc.),  should  be 
collected subsequently, if not available at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent to 
ImClone’s  affiliates  or  delegates  including  TRIO Safety  Officer,  Lilly  GPS,  or  the  Medical 
Monitor using the same procedure as the initial SAE report.

For ease of analysis, worldwide standardization, and regulatory reporting, the study sponsor will 
code each reported AE or symptom to its corresponding preferred term and system organ class in 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) dictionary.  The NCI-CTCAE v 
3.0  (http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf)[65] will  serve  as  the  reference  document  for 
determining/grading  the  severity  or  toxicity  grade  of  all  AEs  and  other  symptoms,  with  the 
exception of Grade 4 infusion reaction (see Section 9.1.1).  For AEs whose toxicity grading is 
not contained within the NCI-CTCAE v 3.0 toxicity criteria, the principal investigator will be 
responsible for assessing severity based on the intensity of the event as it presented.  Severity 
will  be  graded  as  mild  (Grade  1),  moderate  (Grade  2),  severe  (Grade  3), very  severe/life

threatening (Grade 4), or death (Grade 5).  It is recommended that investigators and study site 
personnel  enter  the  reported/verbatim  AE  term  on  the  CRF  and  SAER  form  as  accurately  as 
possible, regardless of the NCI-CTCAE v 3.0 terminologies for the event.  The NCI-CTCAE v 
3.0 criteria should only be used to assign the intensity/severity of the event as described above.

As required, all investigators will be notified of all AE reports that are determined to be serious, 
unexpected,  and  related  (by  the  reporting  investigator  and/or  safety  monitor)  to  the 
investigational product.  The notification will be in the form of a Safety Update (Dear Doctor) 
Letter.    The  notification  is  considered  an  addendum  to  the  current  Investigator’s  Brochure; 
therefore, upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and immediately submit a 
copy to the IRB/aEC according to local regulations.  The notification must be retained within the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  The investigator and IRB/aEC will determine if the informed consent   
requires  revision.    The  investigator  also  should  comply  with  the  IRB/aEC  procedures  for 
reporting any other safety information.

IMC-1121B/Placebo

9 TREATMENT-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS
9.1
Patients will be closely monitored for treatment-related AEs, especially infusion reactions.  AEs 
of concern, which may or may not be associated with IMC-1121B therapy, include hypertension, 
arterial or venous thrombotic events, and proteinuria.

For  the  duration  that  patients  are  on  study  therapy,  AE monitoring  will  be  done  continually.  
Patients will be evaluated for AEs at each visit and will be instructed to call their physician to 
report any AEs between visits.  

9.1.1

Infusion Reactions

Infusion  reactions  are  defined  according  to  the  NCI-CTCAE v  3.0  definition  of  allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity, as follows:

 Grade 1:  transient flushing or rash, drug fever < 38°C
 Grade 2:  rash, flushing, urticaria, dyspnea, drug fever  38°C
 Grade  3: 

  symptomatic  bronchospasm, 

medication(s),  with 
edema/angioedema, hypotension

requiring  parenteral 
allergy-related 
 Grade 4:  anaphylaxis (a life-threatening event characterized by the 
[often  within  minutes]  of  airway  obstruction 

rapid  onset 
[bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness], urticaria, and/or hypotension)

or  without 

urticaria; 

Consistent  with  usual  medical  practice,  selected  parenteral  medications  may  be  utilized  for 
≥ Grade 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions as described below.  The TRIO Safety Officer, or 
the Medical Monitor should be contacted immediately if questions arise concerning the grade of 
the reaction.

The following are treatment guidelines for infusion reactions:

Grade 1

 Slow the infusion rate by 50%
 Monitor the patient for worsening of condition
 For  subsequent 

infusions,  premedicate  with  diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride  50 mg  I.V. (or  equivalent);  additional  premedication 
may be administered at the investigator’s discretion

 Resume  the  infusion  at  50%  of  the  prior  rate  once  the  infusion 
reaction has resolved or decreased to Grade 1; the infusion duration 
should not exceed 2 hours

 Monitor for worsening of condition
 For  subsequent 

infusions,  premedicate  with  diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride  50 mg  I.V. (or  equivalent);  additional  premedication 
may be administered at the investigator’s discretion

For a second Grade 1 or 2 infusion reaction, administer dexamethasone 8-10 mg I.V.; then, for 
subsequent  infusions,  premedicate  with  diphenhydramine  hydrochloride  50  mg  I.V.
(or 
equivalent), acetaminophen 650 mg orally, and dexamethasone 8-10 mg I.V. (or equivalent).

If a patient experiences an infusion reaction to IMC-1121B or placebo, a blood sample for anti-
IMC-1121B antibody analysis will be drawn as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the 
resolution of the event, and 30 days following the event.

9.1.2

Hypertension

If a patient develops hypertension during the study, she should be treated with anti-hypertensive 
medications according to standard medical practice.

Grade < 3

 For asymptomatic hypertension (< 160/100 mm Hg), IMC-1121B or 
placebo therapy should continue without interruption and with anti-
hypertensive therapy if appropriate
 For  mildly  symptomatic  hypertension,  IMC-1121B  or  placebo  will 
be held until the hypertension has resolved to < 160/100 mm Hg and 
is asymptomatic

In  the  event  that  IMC-1121B  or  placebo  therapy  is  held  for  hypertension  (ie,  symptomatic 
hypertension,  markedly  elevated  blood  pressure  responsive  to  anti-hypertensive  therapy),  the 
dose of IMC-1121B or placebo should be reduced upon re-treatment to 8 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  
A  second  dose  reduction  to  6  mg/kg  every  3 weeks should  be  undertaken  if  an  additional 
postponement of therapy is required (as detailed above).  Although IMC-1121B or placebo may 
be held for toxicity, patients may continue receiving docetaxel therapy, at the discretion of the 
investigator.

Grade 3

 For Grade 3  hypertension (“requiring  more than  one drug or more 
intensive therapy than previously”) continue IMC-1121B or placebo 
with  more  intensive  anti-hypertensive  therapy.    If  systolic  BP 
remains  > 160  or  diastolic  BP  > 100  mmHg  > 2 weeks  after 
initiation  of  additional  anti-hypertensive  therapy  (as  noted  above) 
IMC-1121B  or  placebo  will  be  held  while  continuing  appropriate 
anti-hypertensive therapy.
 For mildly symptomatic hypertension, IMC -1121B or placebo will 
be held until the hypertension has resolved to < 160/100 mm Hg and 
is asymptomatic

In  the  event  that  IMC-1121B  or  placebo  therapy  is  held  for  hypertension (ie,  symptomatic 
hypertension,  markedly  elevated  blood  pressure  responsive  to  anti-hypertensive  therapy),  the 
dose of IMC-1121B or placebo should be reduced upon re-treatment to 8 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  
A  second  dose  reduction  to  6  mg/kg  every  3 weeks should  be  undertaken  if  an  additional

postponement of therapy is required (as detailed above).  Although IMC-1121B or placebo may 
be held for toxicity, patients may continue receiving docetaxel therapy, at the discretion of the 
investigator.

Grade 4 or refractory

 Patients with Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) or patients 
whose  hypertension  is  poorly  controlled  (> 160  systolic  or  > 100 
mmHg diastolic for > 3 weeks) despite appropriate oral medication 
will  be discontinued  from IMC-1121B or placebo therapy but  may
continue to receive docetaxel, at the discretion of the investigator

9.1.3

Thrombotic Events

Investigators  should  perform  all  testing  required  to  fully  characterize  arterial  or  venous 
thrombotic/vascular events.  The incidence, type, and diagnostic tests used for the confirmation 
of thrombotic/vascular events will  be collected and reported.  IMC-1121B or placebo therapy 
should be discontinued in the event of any Grade 3-4 arterial or venous thrombotic event that is 
considered by the investigator to be life-threatening, or symptomatic and not adequately treated 
by anticoagulation therapy.  Docetaxel therapy may continue at the discretion of the investigator.

At the investigator’s discretion, IMC-1121B or placebo may be continued in this setting of an 
incidentally  diagnosed  asymptomatic  deep  vein  thrombosis  or  pulmonary  embolism,  or 
following  a symptomatic deep  vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism when symptoms  have 
resolved  with  the  administration of  anticoagulation  therapy.    In  the  event  that  a  patient 
experiences a Grade 4 pulmonary embolism or a Grade 3-4 venous thromboembolic event that is 
considered by the investigator to be life-threatening, or symptomatic and not adequately treated 
by anticoagulation therapy, the patient will not receive further IMC-1121B or placebo treatment.  
IMC-1121B or placebo should also be discontinued in the setting of a deep vein thrombosis or 
pulmonary  embolism  that  occurs  or  intensifies  while  the  patient  is  receiving  therapeutic 
anticoagulation therapy.  Docetaxel therapy may continue at the discretion of the investigator.

9.1.4

Bleeding (Hemorrhagic) Events

Serious hemorrhagic adverse events have been reported from clinical studies investigating IMC-
1121B.  Hemorrhagic complications are associated with some malignancies (ie, variceal bleeding 
from  portal  hypertension  in  hepatocellular  carcinoma,  lower  GI hemorrhage  from  bowel 
metastases in ovarian carcinoma), although the rate of these complications varies considerably.  
As detailed  in the IMC-1121B Investigator’s Brochure, the  incidences of  hemorrhagic events, 
significant  background  incidence  of  bleeding  in  some  malignancies,  and  use  of  concomitant 
antiplatelet therapy in some of the reported cases precludes any definitive association between 
bleeding and IMC-1121B, although ongoing  surveillance  and  identification (and exclusion) of 
patients with high bleeding risk remain essential.

IMC-1121B or placebo therapy should be discontinued in the event of any Grade 3-4 bleeding 
(hemorrhagic) event.

Proteinuria

9.1.5
If, while on therapy, a patient has proteinuria  2+ per a dipstick or routine urinalysis test, a 24-
hour urine collection will be conducted.  If the protein level is < 2 g/24 hours, the patient will 
continue on IMC-1121B or placebo therapy at the same dose without interruption.  If the protein 
level is 2-3 g/24 hours, IMC-1121B or placebo therapy will be held for up to 3 weeks and a 24-
hour urine collection will be repeated.  Treatment will resume at a reduced dose level (8 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks) once the protein level returns to < 2 g/24 hours.  A second dose reduction to 6 
mg/kg  every  3  weeks  is  permitted  if  proteinuria  >  2g/24  hours  recurs.    The  patient  will  be 
discontinued from the study if the protein level is > 3 g/24 hours, if there is a third occurrence of 
>  2 g/24 hours  proteinuria,  or  if  the  protein  level  does  not  return  to  < 2 g/24 hours  within  3 
weeks.

9.1.6

Gastrointestinal Perforation

An  infrequent  incidence  of  GI  perforations  has  been  associated  with  some  antiangiogenic
therapeutic agents, most specifically in the context of colorectal cancer (treated with combination 
regimens including anti-VEGF antibodies and cytotoxic chemotherapy) and in advanced ovarian 
cancer. These events may be associated with extensive abdominal/peritoneal disease burden.

Ramucirumab

ImClone LLC

Gastrointestinal  perforation  has  been  reported  from  clinical  studies  investigating  IMC-1121B. 
The incidences of these events to date and presence of significant comorbidities and risk factors 
preclude  any  definitive  association  with  IMC-1121B,  although  ongoing  surveillance remains 
essential.  Three GI perforations have been reported in Phase 2 studies investigating IMC-1121B
(overall incidence, 0.8% of patients).  Two of these events occurred on the ovarian cancer study 
(CP12-0711)  and  1 on  the  prostate  cancer  study  (CP18-0601). All  3  cases were  reported  as 
SAEs; the events on the ovarian cancer study included a Grade 4 colonic perforation (considered 
probably related by the investigator) and a Grade 5 bowel perforation (considered unrelated); the 
perforation  occurring  on  the  prostate  cancer  study  was  a  Grade  3 rectal  perforation  (possibly 
related).  Each of these  events was characterized by  extensive abdominal  and/or pelvic tumor 
burden,  including  an  obstructing  lesion  immediately  distal  to  an area  of  dilated  intestine  and 
perforation (Grade 5 event on the ovarian cancer study), a diffusely infiltrated peritoneum (Grade 
4 event on the ovarian cancer study), and prior pelvic radiation (Grade 3 event on the prostate 
cancer study).

IMC-1121B/placebo should be discontinued in the setting of any gastrointestinal perforation.

9.1.7

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)      

As of 01 November 2011, one event of RPLS has been reported in the double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled  Phase  3  CRC  study  CP12-0920  (I4T-MC-JVBB)  as  a  Grade  3  SAE 
determined to be related to administration of all study drugs, including blinded investigational 
drug product (the treatment assignment  for this  patient remains  blinded). As of 01 September 
2011,  683  patients  have been  administered  ramucirumab  DP  in  open  label  studies  either  as  a 
monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  cytotoxic  treatment,  and  1,639  patients  have  been 
administered either ramucirumab DP or placebo either as monotherapy or in combination with 
cytotoxic  therapy  in  double-blind,  randomized  studies:  a  review  of  the  ramucirumab  safety 
database at this time indicates that there have been no other reported cases of RPLS across the 
ramucirumab DP clinical program. Because hypertension is an identified risk for ramucirumab, 
investigators should control blood pressure in accordance with the guidelines in the IB and in 
relevant  sections  of  the  study  protocol  (Section  9.4.1.1.1.2).  In  addition,  investigators  should 
consider  a  diagnosis  of  RPLS  in  the  setting  of  seizures,  headache,  nausea,  delirium,  visual 
changes  and/or  other  unexplained  neurological  symptoms,  especially  in  combination  with

hypertension and MRI findings of hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion 
recovery images. If the diagnosis of RPLS is confirmed, ramucirumab DP should be permanently 
discontinued.

9.2 Docetaxel

9.2.1

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and 
second  infusions.    Severe  hypersensitivity  reactions  are  characterized  by  hypotension  and/or 
bronchospasm, or generalized rash/erythema and very rarely fatal anaphylaxis.  Hypersensitive 
reactions require immediate discontinuation of docetaxel infusion but the patients may continue 
to receive IMC-1121B or placebo.  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions 
should not be rechallenged with docetaxel.

Description and suggested management of docetaxel hypersensitivity reactions follows.[66]

Mild symptoms:  localized cutaneous reaction such as mild pruritus, flushing, rash

 Consider decreasing the rate of infusion until recovery of symptoms, 
 Then, complete docetaxel infusion at the initial planned rate

stay at bedside

Moderate symptoms:  any  symptom  not  listed  above  (mild  symptoms)  or  below  (severe 
symptoms),  such  as  generalized  pruritus,  flushing,  rash,  dyspnea,  hypotension  with  systolic 
blood pressure (BP) > 80 mm Hg.

 Stop docetaxel infusion
 Give I.V. dexamethasone 8-10 mg (or equivalent) and/or 
 Resume docetaxel infusion after recovery of symptoms.

diphenhydramine 50 mg I.V. (or equivalent)

Severe symptoms  such  as:  bronchospasm,  generalized  urticaria,  systolic  BP  ≤ 80  mm  Hg, 
angioedema

 Stop docetaxel infusion
 Give  I.V. diphenhydramine  50  mg  (or  equivalent)  and/or  I.V.

equivalent)  30 minutes  prior  to  docetaxel  infusion.    This  is  in  addition  to  the  prescribed  oral 
dexamethasone.

Patients  with  hypersensitivity  reactions  to  docetaxel  are  at  risk  for  recurrent  reactions.    For 
patients who experience moderate or severe hypersensitivity reactions, the docetaxel should be 
administered over 2 hours for subsequent treatment courses in addition to premedication as noted 
above.  These patients must be informed of the potential risk of recurrent allergic reactions and 
must be carefully monitored.

In  cases  of  late  occurring (eg,  appearance  within  1  week  after  treatment)  hypersensitivity 
symptoms of a localized or generalized pruritus, symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine).  Additional oral or I.V. premedication with antihistamine may also be given for 
the  next  cycle  of  treatment  depending  on  the  intensity  of  the  reaction observed.    No  dose 
reductions will be made in any case.

Hematologic Toxicity

9.2.2
Neutropenia (< 2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in almost all patients treated with docetaxel 60-
100  mg/m2 and  Grade  4  neutropenia  (< 500  cells/mm3)  occurred  in  85%  of  patients  given

100 mg/m2 and  75%  of  patients  given  60  mg/m2.    Frequent  monitoring  of  blood  counts  is 
therefore essential so that the dose can  be adjusted.  If Grade ≥ 2 neutropenia occurs, weekly 
monitoring of blood counts is recommended.  Docetaxel should not be administered to patients 
with neutrophils < 1500 cells/mm3.

9.2.3

Fluid Retention

Severe  fluid  retention  has  been  reported  following  docetaxel  therapy.    It  is  characterized  by 
poorly tolerated peripheral edema, generalized edema, pleural effusion requiring urgent drainage, 
dyspnea  at  rest,  cardiac  tamponade,  and  pronounced  abdominal  distention  (due  to  ascites).  
Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids (or parenteral corticosteroids according 
to institutional guidelines and current standard practice) prior to each docetaxel administration to 
reduce  the  incidence  and  severity  of  fluid  retention.    When  fluid  retention  occurs,  peripheral 
edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight 
gain of 2 kg.  Patients with pre-existing pleural effusions should be closely monitored from the 
first dose of docetaxel for the possible exacerbation of the effusion.

9.2.4

Hepatic Impairment

The  incidence  of  treatment-related  mortality  associated  with  docetaxel  therapy  is  increased  in 
patients with abnormal liver function.  Patients with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of 
transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increased risk for the development of 
Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, severe thrombocytopenia, severe stomatitis, 
severe skin toxicity, and toxic death. 

9.2.5

Neurologic

Severe  neurosensory  symptoms  (paresthesia,  dysesthesia,  pain)  may  occur  in  patients  treated 
with docetaxel.

9.2.6

Asthenia

Symptoms  of  fatigue  and  weakness  may  last  a  few days  up  to  several  weeks  and  may  be 
associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with PD.

10 DOSE MODIFICATIONS
The  doses of IMC-1121B/placebo  and  docetaxel  can  be  modified  according  to Table  3 for 
hematologic toxicities (Table 4) and nonhematologic toxicities (Table 5). The ImClone Medical 
Monitor     should  be  contacted  immediately  if  questions  arise  concerning  dose  modifications.  
Refer to Section 9 for specific treatment-related toxicity information and dose modifications.  If 
a  patient’s  dosage  is  reduced  or  treatment  is  discontinued  as  a  result  of  an  AE,  study  site 
personnel  must  clearly  report  to  ImClone  or  TRIO via  the  CRF  the  circumstances  and  data 
leading to any such dosage reduction or discontinuation of treatment.

If a Grade 4 AE occurs and is deemed at least possibly related to IMC-1121B, then IMC-1121B
should  be  discontinued  except  in  the  specific  case  of  Grade  4  fever  or  Grade  4  laboratory 
abnormalities.  If Grade 4 fever or laboratory abnormalities resolve to Grade ≤1 or pretreatment 
baseline within one treatment cycle (approximately 3 weeks), treatment with IMC-1121B may be 
continued at the discretion of the investigator.

In  the  event  that  the  administration  of  IMC-1121B/placebo  or  docetaxel  is  delayed  (up  to 
3 weeks),  the  administration  of  the  other  investigational  agent  will  be  postponed  as  well  to 
maintain  a  concurrent  dosing  schedule  for  both  agents.  The  2 study  drugs  must  always  be 
administered on the same day.

11 CRITERIA FOR TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION
Patients  will  be  evaluated  for  response according  to  RECIST guidelines[1],  which  have been 
modified based on current practices of the medical community.[2]

11.1 Baseline Tumor Assessments
The baseline tumor burden (unidimensionally-measurable and non-measurable disease) will be 
assessed within 28 days prior to randomization.  The investigator will identify, prospectively, the 
lesions to be followed to evaluate the patient’s response to therapy (see Section 11.4, Definitions 
of Response).

11.2 Method of Tumor Response Assessment

The  same  method  of  assessment  and  the  same  technique  must be  used  to  characterize  each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and at reassessment during treatment.  Imaging-based 
evaluation will be preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been 
used  to  assess  the  antitumor  effect  of  a  treatment.    Lesions  evaluated  clinically  will  only  be 
considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes).  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  CT and MRI are considered the best currently available and 
reproducible methods to measure target lesions (as defined in Section 11.4) selected for response 
assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice 
thickness  contiguously.    Spiral  CT  should be  performed  using  a  5-8  mm  contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm (as a general rule,  lesion diameter should  be  no  less than double the 
slice thickness).  This applies to images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; CT/MRI scans of the 
head, neck, and extremities usually require specific protocols.  Ultrasound is not an acceptable 
method to measure disease.  Bone scans and x-rays may be performed as clinically indicated.

11.3 Definitions
Measurable:
Lesions  that  can  be  accurately  measured in  at  least  one  dimension  (longest  diameter  to  be 
recorded) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional techniques or ≥ 2 times the reconstruction interval when 
using spiral CT scan, but no less than 10 mm.

Ramucirumab

ImClone LLC

A lesion located in a previously irradiated area will be considered measurable only if there has 
been a documented increase in size subsequent to irradiation but prior to study entry.

Very  small  tumors  are  subject  to  inconsistent  and  inaccurate  measurement.    For  this  reason, 
target lesions that have reduced in size to ≤ 5 mm will be assigned a longest diameter of 5 mm 
for  the  purpose  of  calculations  regarding  tumor  progression  or  response  via  RECIST.    If  the 
longest diameter subsequently increases in size to 5 mm or larger, the true size will be recorded.  
The purpose of the assigned value for the measurement is the acknowledgment that small lesions 
are not accurately measured.

If a target lesion has completely disappeared, 0 mm measurement will be assigned to the longest 
diameter for calculations regarding progression or response via RECIST.

Non-measurable:
All  other  lesions  including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter  <  20  mm  with  conventional 
techniques or 2 times the reconstruction interval with spiral CT scan) and truly non-measurable 
lesions.

  bone  lesions, 
Lesions  considered  to  be  truly  non-measurable  include  the  following: 
leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural/pericardial  effusion,  inflammatory  breast  disease, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging 
techniques, and cystic lesions.

11.4 Definitions of Response
Overall tumor response, as defined in Section 11.5, is based on an integration of the evaluation 
of target, non-target, and new lesions, as described below:

11.4.1 Target Lesions

Target lesions are all measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their  size  (those  with  the  longest  diameters)  and  their  suitability  for  accurate  repeated 
measurements either by imaging techniques or clinically.

Ramucirumab

ImClone LLC

The sum of the longest diameters of all target lesions will be calculated at baseline and reported 
as the baseline sum longest diameter.  This baseline sum longest diameter will be used as the 
reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.  For lesions measurable in 2 or 
3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter at the time of each assessment.

Complete Response (CR):
The disappearance of all target lesions.

Partial Response (PR):
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum longest diameter.

Stable Disease (SD):
Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to  qualify  for  partial  response  nor  sufficient  increase  to  qualify 
progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since baseline.

Progressive Disease (PD): 
At  least  a  20%  increase  in  the  sum  of  the  longest  diameter  of the  target  lesions,  taking  as 
reference the smallest sum longest diameter since baseline or the appearance of one or more new 
lesion(s).

Unable to Evaluate (UE):
A  target  lesion  present  at  baseline  which  is  not measured  or  which  is  unable  to  be  evaluated 
leading  to  an  inability  to  determine  the  status  of  that  particular  tumor  for  the  time  point  in 
question.  This category also includes scans that are not performed at this time point to evaluate 
the target lesions.

Not Applicable (NA):
No target lesions identified at baseline.

11.4.2 Non-Target Lesions

All  other  lesions  (or  sites  of  disease),  both  measurable  and  non-measurable,  not  classified  as 
target lesions will be identified as non-target lesions and will be recorded at baseline.  Non-target

lesions will  be evaluated at the same assessment time points as target lesions.  Measurements 
will not be required, and these lesions will be followed as “present” or “absent”.

Complete Response: 
The disappearance of all non-target lesions.

Stable Disease/Incomplete Response: 
The persistence of one or more non-target lesions not qualifying for either CR or PD.

Progressive Disease: 
The unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesion(s).

Unable to evaluate (UE):
A non-target lesion present at baseline which is unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to 
determine the status of that particular tumor for the time point in question.  This category also 
includes scans that are not performed at this time point to evaluate the non-target lesions.

Not Applicable (NA):
No non-target lesion identified at baseline.

11.4.3 Symptomatic Deterioration (Clinical Progression)

As detailed in Section 10.3, a deterioration in ECOG performance status of ≥ 2 units compared to 
baseline  is  criteria  for  removal  from  study  therapy.    Although  this  symptomatic  deterioration 
warrants  discontinuation  of  therapy, it  is  requested  that  the  investigator  determine  (whenever 
possible) whether this symptomatic deterioration is attributable to cancer versus other etiologies 
(ie,  side  effect  of  therapy,  worsening  of  concurrent  illnesses).    Whenever  possible,  patients 
removed from therapy solely for symptomatic deterioration should be followed for subsequent 
radiographic progression.

11.5 Determination of Overall Response
Each response parameter (target, non-target, and new lesions) will be reported independently at 
each  radiological  evaluation.    The  investigator  will  make  a  determination  of  overall  response 
based on the evaluation of target, non-target, and new lesions, as shown in Table 6.

To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes  in tumor  measurements  must be confirmed  by 
repeat evaluations, which should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response 
are  first  met.    CR  must  be  confirmed  at  the  consecutive  tumor  assessment  while  PR  can  be 
confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment.  In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must 
have met the SD criteria at least once after the study entry at a minimum interval of 35 days.1

For patients who discontinue therapy for reasons other than PD (eg, toxicity), every effort should 
be made to document tumor measurements and the extent of disease, even after discontinuation 
of therapy, in order to classify patients for overall response as described above.  Patients with a 
global deterioration of their health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration”.  
Patients  who  do  not  have  a  tumor  response  assessment  for  any  reason  are  considered 
nonresponders and are included in the denominator for the response rate.
                                               

1 Per the IRC charter, measurements should be captured at the beginning of the 6th week of treatment.

In  some  circumstances,  it  may  be  difficult  to  distinguish  residual  disease  from  normal  tissue.  
When the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated and ruled out (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the complete 
response status.

12 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS
12.1 General Considerations    
The  analysis  of  all  the  efficacy  endpoints  and  safety  data  will  be  performed  by TRIO or  its 
designee.    All  the  tests  to  be  performed  will  be  two-tailed  with  a  5%  significance  level,  or 
equivalently  one-tailed  with  a  2.5%  significance  level,  unless  otherwise  indicated.    A  group 
sequential analysis for the primary objective, the comparison of PFS between the 2 study arms 
will  be  conducted.    Futility  analyses  will  be  conducted  when  25%  and  40%  of  the  expected 
number of PFS events are observed, approximately 200 and 318 PFS events, respectively.   A
final  analysis  will  be  performed  once  796 PFS  expected events  are  observed.   Th ese  interim 
analyses will  be  performed  by  an  IDMC.    The  efficacy analyses  based  on  the  investigator 
assessment will be the main analyses.  A second efficacy analysis will also be generated using 
the IRC assessment.

12.2 Determination of Sample Size

The primary objective of this trial  is to show the superiority of IMC-1121B plus docetaxel as 
compared to placebo plus docetaxel in terms of PFS.  The primary hypothesis will be tested at 
the  final analysis at a one-sided 0.025  level.  Futility will  be tested at each of the two interim 
analyses for PFS, and there will be no testing for superiority in PFS at the interim analyses.  The 
sample size was determined using a group sequential analysis methodology (as implemented in 
EaSt version 5.2) based on the following assumptions:

 The accrual rate is 40 patients per month
 The  median  PFS  is  6  months  in  the  control  group  (placebo  plus 


docetaxel)
It is of clinical interest to show a 2 month improvement in median 
PFS (ie, 8 months, 33% increase)

 The randomization ratio is 2:1 (IMC-1121B:placebo)
 Although the primary hypothesis will be tested with an overall one-
tailed significance  level of 0.025, a one-tailed significance  level of 
0.005 was used to power the study.  This was chosen so as to ensure 
sufficient probability of a strongly significant and robust result at the 
end of the study for regulatory purposes. 
 The type II error rate is 14%, ie, the power of the trial is set to 86% 

for a PFS hazard ratio of 0.75

 The  futility  rule  at  each  of  the  two  interim  analyses  has  been 
constructed using the beta-spending approach, so as to fix both the 
type  II  error  spent  (ie,
the  probability  under  the  alternative 
hypothesis of making the incorrect decision to stop the study) while 
controlling the probability under the null  hypothesis of  making the 
incorrect decision of continuing the study at appropriate levels
 The  first  interim  futility analysis will  be performed when 200 PFS 
(25%) events are observed among approximately 490 patients.  The 
second  one  will  be  performed  when  318  (40%)  of  events  are 
observed among approximately 650 patients.
 At first interim analysis (25% of PFS events), the type II error spent 
is 5.5%, which corresponds to stopping the study  for  futility  if the 
hazard ratio is greater than 0.95
 At second interim analysis (40% of PFS events), the cumulative type 
II error spent is 8.8%, which corresponds to stopping the study for 
futility if the hazard ratio is greater than 0.90
 The  hazard  ratio  is  the  ratio  of  the  hazard  of  the  experimental 

treatment over the control

Under  these  assumptions,  the  estimated  total  number of  events  to  be  observed  at  the  final 
analysis is 796 from an expected accrual of 1002 patients.[68]  Assuming a 10% drop-out rate, it 
is estimated that 1113 patients will need to be randomized.

This sample size will also be sufficient for a group sequential analysis of overall survival (OS), 
at  the  0.05  significance  level with  approximately  85%  power,  for  testing  a  null  hypothesis 
HR=1.0 versus the alternative HR=0.8, based on a median survival of 24 months for the control 
group and median survival of 30 months for the experimental group.  One single interim analysis
for OS will be performed at the time of the final PFS analysis or when at least 375 OS events 
have been observed (whichever is later), and a final efficacy  analysis will be conducted when at 
least 792 OS events are observed during the study follow-up.

While early stopping for positive efficacy at any interim analysis is not expected or planned, as 
the data is being reported at that time a nominal alpha of 0.00001 will be spent for PFS at each 
interim analysis.     

12.2.1

Justification for change in interim analysis timing at Protocol Amendment 6:

 At  the  first  interim  analysis  the  HR  bound  was  changed  from 
previous plan of 1.10 to 0.95 to provide a more rigorous assessment 
of futility by reducing the probability of continuing the study if the 
null hypothesis of no treatment effect is true. 
 The planned time point for second interim analysis was changed from 50% of expected PFS 
events  accumulation  to  40% of  expected  PFS  event  accumulation  and  the  HR  bound  was 
changed  from  0.94  to  0.90.    Changing  the  time  point  to  40%  of  expected  PFS  event 
accumulation will allow for futility assessment at a time point at which 63% of committed 
accrual would have been achieved.  If a decision to stop the study is mandated at this time, it 
would prevent ~300 to 350 additional patients from exposure to an ineffective study drug.
 The  interim  analysis  at  the  75%  the  expected  events  accumulation  was  dropped  from  the 
plan.   At this time point two rigorous  interim  futility analyses will  have  been passed, and 
approximately 991 patients would have been accrued.  The time lapse between the data cut to 
IDMC decision meeting will mean that full accrual would likely be reached before the study 
could be stopped, and so would not prevent any further enrollment.

12.3 Analysis Populations 

The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  analyses  will  be  based  on  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)
population.  This population is defined as all randomized patients, and will consider allocation to 
treatment groups as randomized by the IWRS.

The  safety  population,  used  for  all  safety  analyses,  includes  all  randomized  patients  who 
received  any  dose  of  investigational  product.  Allocation  to treatment  groups  is  based  on  the 
treatment actually received. 

The Per-Protocol population is a subset of the ITT population and consists of the randomized and 
treated  patients  who  do  not  have  a  major  protocol  violation,  such  as  noncompliance  with  the 
Inclusion  or  Exclusion  Criteria,  or  other  major  protocol  noncompliance  (defined  prior  to 
database  lock)  during  the  study.    This  population  will  be  used  for  sensitivity  analyses  of  the 
primary efficacy variable.

12.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Baseline  demographics,  medical  history,  vital  signs,  clinical  laboratory  results,  and  tumor 
measurements will be listed and tabulated.

12.5 Primary Endpoint

12.5.1 Progression-Free Survival

The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial, PFS, is defined as the time from randomization until 
the first evidence of progression as defined by RECIST[1], modified based on current practice of 
the medical community[2], or death from any cause.[69]  Patients who have neither progressed 
nor died will be censored at the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment, if available, or 
date of randomization if no post initiation radiographic assessment is available.  If death or PD 
occurs after 2 or more missing radiographic visits, censoring will occur at the date of the  last 
radiographic  visit. The  primary  efficacy  analysis  will  be based  on  investigators’ assessments. 
The  symptomatic/clinical  disease  progression  (deterioration) without  documented  radiologic 
progression will not constitute progression for the purposes of determining PFS.

The primary analysis will compare the PFS observed under the combination therapy IMC-1121B
plus  docetaxel versus  placebo  plus  docetaxel based  on  the  investigator  assessment.    The 
comparison will use the log-rank test, stratified by prior use of taxane therapy (yes/no), visceral 
metastasis  (yes/no),  hormone  receptor  status  (positive  vs.  negative/unknown),  and  at  most  3
geographical  regions:  1)  North  and  South America,  2) Europe/Australia/New  Zealand,  and 
3) Asia/Africa/Middle East.  An additional analysis with an unstratified log-rank test will also be 
performed.  The estimation of the survival curves for the 2 treatment groups will be generated 
using the Kaplan-Meier methodology.  A stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model to 
compare  the  treatments  within  the  clusters  defined  by  the  stratifying  variables  will  also  be 
performed to generate the hazard ratio.  An additional unstratified Cox regression model will be 
employed to explore the effects of prognostic variables, such as of the stratification variables, 
and  intrinsic/extrinsic  factors,  on  treatment  response.   More  details  are  contained  in  the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

The final analysis of PFS will include sensitivity analyses under the following conditions:

 Using  the  investigator  PFS results including  symptomatic  disease
 Using  the  Investigator  provided  PFS  from  the  Per  Protocol 
 Using the IRC provided PFS from the ITT population
 Using the IRC provided PFS from the Per Protocol population
 Using the investigator provided PFS results from the ITT population, 
considering  different  censoring  rules  to  control  for  missing  data 
and/or lost to follow-up[69], as described in the SAP

An analysis of the level of agreement between the 2 radiologists of the IRC, and between the 
investigator and the IRC will be performed.

12.5.2

Interim and Final Analyses of Primary Endpoint

A  group  sequential  analysis  for  the  primary  objective,  the  comparison  of  PFS  between  the 
2 study arms will be conducted.  Futility analyses will be conducted when 25%, and 40% of the 
expected  number  of  PFS  events  are  observed,  approximately  200 and  318 PFS  events, 
respectively.[68]  A final analysis will be performed once 796 PFS expected events are observed.  
These  interim  analyses  will  be  performed  by  an  IDMC  which will  recommend  early 
discontinuation of the study or continuation of the study for full patient accrual.

Refer to Section 12.2 for the stopping rules for each of the interim futility analyses.  

Assuming  full  enrollment, the  final  PFS analysis  will  be  a  two-tailed  test  with  a  significance 
level  of  2*(0.02498) to  preserve  the  planned  0.05 overall  significance  level.    If  the  IDMC 
recommends early stopping of the study based on the interim futility analysis performed when 
25%  or  40% of  the  expected  PFS  events  have  been  observed, then  the  final  analysis  will  be 
conducted once sufficient data has been collected for the patients enrolled at that time the study 
was stopped.

12.6 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints to be analyzed are:

 Overall survival

Confidential

Redacted VersionClinical Trial Protocol:  IMCL CP12-0606/I4T-IE-JVBC/TRIO-012
Ramucirumab

ImClone LLC

 Time to progression
 Objective response rate
 Duration of response
 Quality of life

The secondary endpoints will be adjusted by the stratification factors.  An additional unstratified 
analysis will also be performed.

12.6.1 Overall Survival

Overall survival  is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of death 
from any cause.  Patients alive at data cut-off for the OS analysis, or lost to follow-up will be 
censored  on  the  last  date  the  patient  is  known  to  be  alive.  The  treatment  groups  will  be 
compared using the stratified  log-rank test and the  survival  curves will  be  estimated, together 
with  corresponding  summary  statistics.  The  survival  curves  for  each  treatment  group will  be 
generated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology.

One  single  interim analysis  for OS will  be performed at the time of the  final PFS analysis or 
when  at  least  375  OS  events  have  been  observed  (whichever  is  later),  and  a  final  efficacy 
analysis will be conducted when at least 792 OS events are observed during the study follow-up. 
At  the  time  of  interim  analysis,  an  alpha  of  0.005 (one-tailed) is  planned to  assess  the 
significance of OS results.  The significance level for the final analysis will be calculated such 
that the overall 0.05 (two-tailed, or 0.025 one-tailed) significance level will be maintained for the 
OS analysis.

Specifically,  the  significance  level  at  the  time  of  interim  analysis  will  be  based  on  the  actual 
number of events observed using an alpha-spending function.  The alpha-spending function (one-
tailed)  is  formed  by  linear  interpolation  between the origin (time=0,  cumulative alpha=0), the 
anticipated interim analysis time point (time=375/792=0.4735, cumulative alpha=0.005), and the 
final analysis (time=1, cumulative alpha=0.025).  

A gate-keeping strategy will be utilized to control the overall alpha at 0.025 (one-sided) for the 
analyses of the primary endpoint PFS and the secondary endpoint OS.  At the time of final PFS 
analysis, only if the primary PFS test is significant, will the analyses of OS (as outlined above)

be considered inferential.  In the case that the primary PFS results do not favor the IMC-1121B 
arm, consideration to close the study will be discussed.

12.6.2 Time to Progression

Time to progression is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the first 
documented  date  of  objective  disease  progression.   Definit ive  confirmation  of  PD will  be 
determined by the investigator.

Analysis of efficacy will follow the log-rank test and survival curves estimation.

12.6.3 Objective Response Rate

The  objective  response  rate  will  be  calculated  as  the  number  of  patients  who  achieve  a  best 
confirmed response of CR or PR using the investigator and IRC response assessments, as shown 
in Table 7, divided by the total number of patients randomized to that study arm, based on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  This determination of ORR will be 
performed  during  the  analysis,  not  by  the  investigator  or  IRC.    The  objective  response  rates 
observed  in  each  treatment  group  will  be  compared  using  the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test
adjusting for the stratification variables.

Objective response  will  be  determined  based  on  the  evaluation  of  target,  non-target,  and  new 
lesions at each radiological evaluation.  The best overall response is the best response from the 
start of the treatment until PD/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since baseline.  The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement 
of both measurement and confirmation criteria as shown in Table 7.

Patients are required to be on trial at least 35 days from date of randomization before an assessment of SD can be 
made.  SD does not require confirmation.
Subsequent documentation of CR may provide confirmation of previously identified CR for patients where second
integrated response was UE.  Subsequent documentation of PR may provide confirmation of previously identified PR 
for patients where second integrated response was UE or SD.  If the third time point response confirms the CR (or PR) 
then the confirmed response will be CR (or PR).
Response is SD if the increase from the first to the second assessment does not qualify for PD.

To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes  in tumor  measurements  must be confirmed  by 
repeat evaluations, which should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response 
are  first  met.    CR  must  be  confirmed  at  the  consecutive  tumor  assessment  while  PR can  be 
confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment.  In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must 
have met the SD criteria at least once after the study entry at a minimum interval of 35 days.

12.6.4 Duration of Response

The duration of overall response is the interval from date of initial documented response (CR or 
PR) to the first documented date of disease progression or death.  Patients who do not relapse or 
die are censored at the day of their last tumor assessment.  The log-rank test will be performed to 
compare the treatment groups and survival curves estimation will be obtained with the Kaplan-
Meier method. This analysis will only include responders of CR or PR.

12.6.5 Quality of Life 

The quality of life assessment will be conducted using the FACT-B of the FACT questionnaire.  
It  includes  the  subscales  Physical  Well-Being,  Social-Family  Well-Being,  Emotional  Well-
Being, Functional Well-Being, and Additional Concerns, each with 6 or more items developed to 
measure  problems  specific  to  breast  cancer  symptoms  plus  additional  items  related  to  global 
quality of life.  Patients respond to each item on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very 
much).  As scored, or after subtracting from 4, a higher score indicates fewer symptoms.  The 
quality of life data collected in the treatment groups at baseline, every 4 cycles, and at the end of 
therapy will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and two-tailed non-parametric tests with a 
5% significance level.  More details are provided in the SAP.

12.7 Safety Endpoints
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  IMC-1121B,  placebo,  and  docetaxel is  determined  by  reported 
AEs,  physical  examinations,  and  laboratory  tests.    Adverse  events  will  be  summarized  by 
MedDRA™  System  Organ  Class  and  preferred  term,  classified  from  verbatim  terms.    The 
incidence  and  percentage  of  patients  with  at  least one  occurrence  of  a  preferred  term  will  be 
included, according to the most severe NCI-CTCAE v 3.0 grade.  Causality (relationship to study 
drug), will be separately summarized.  Duration of AE will be determined and included in the 
listings along with action taken, and outcome.

Laboratory results will be classified according to NCI-CTCAE v 3.0.  Incidence of laboratory 
abnormalities will be summarized.  Laboratory results not corresponding to a NCI-CTCAE v 3.0 
term will not be graded.

Pre- and  post-treatment  immunogenicity samples  will  be  assayed  using  a  double  antigen 
radiometric  assay.    A  sample  will  be  considered  positive  for  anti-IMC-1121B  antibodies  if  it 
exhibits  a  post-treatment  antibody  level  that  exceeds  the  positive  upper  cut  point  determined 
from  the  anti-IMC-1121B  level  seen  in  healthy  untreated  individuals.    A  patient  will  be 
considered to have an anti-IMC-1121B response if there are 2 consecutive positive samples or if 
the final sample tested is positive.

12.7.1

Interim Safety Analyses

The IDMC will meet at least twice per year, when 50 and 150 patients have received at least 2
cycles of study drug, died, or discontinued  study drug, and at the time of  each of the  interim 
futility analyses to perform an unblinded review of the safety data to minimize patient exposure 
to any unexpected or unnecessary risks.  Upon  completion of the primary endpoint analyses for 
the  796  PFS  events, the  IDMC  will  no  longer  be  needed as  the  Sponsor  will  have  been 
unblinded.  The  Sponsor  will  be  responsible  for  future  Safety  Reviews.  The  IDMC  will  be 
decommissioned at that time.  

12.8 Other Analyses
Data from non-pharmacogenetic or biomarker sample analyses will be summarized and used for 
correlative analyses with safety and/or efficacy endpoints.  Data may be split into ‘exploratory’

and  ‘confirmatory’  subsets  for  analysis  purposes.  Further  details  will  be  described  in  a 
Biomarker Statistical Analysis Plan.

12.9 Blinding
This is a randomized, double-blind, Phase III study.  Patients will be randomized to receive IMC-
1121B or matching placebo in a double-blind fashion such that the patient, medical and ancillary 
medical staff, and the sponsor and its designees will not know which drug is being administered 
in  combination  with  docetaxel.    The  randomization  number  will  be  assigned  based  on 
information obtained from the IWRS.

IMC-1121B  and  placebo  for  injection  will  be  identical  in  appearance  in  order  to  preserve 
blinding.  In order to maintain this blind, study drug (IMC-1121B or placebo) will be uniquely 
labeled, and will be assigned to a patient by using IWRS.

requirements for clinical trials, as applicable.

13.3 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions
This  study  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  International  Conference  on  Harmonisation 
Good  Clinical  Practice  (ICH  GCP)  and  applicable  regulatory  requirements.   The  investigator 
must comply with all requirements of the protocol.  After reading the protocol, each principal 
investigator  will  sign  the  protocol  signature  page  and  send  a  copy  of  the  signed  page  to  an 
ImClone representative.

When a situation occurs that requires a temporary departure from the protocol, the investigator or 
other  physician  in  attendance  must contact TRIO (or  its  designee)  or  the  Sponsor as  soon  as 
possible  in  order  to  discuss  the  situation  and  agree  on  an  appropriate  course  of  action.    The 
investigator will describe the departure from the protocol and the circumstances requiring it on 
the CRF and will notify the IRB/aEC as appropriate.

The investigator may not modify this protocol.  Amendments initiated by ImClone or its agents 
will be confirmed in writing in the form of a protocol amendment.  All such amendments must 
be  approved  by  the  IRB/aEC;  however,  amendments  that  reduce  risks  to the  patients  may  be 
implemented prior to obtaining IRB/aEC approval.  Patients may not be enrolled in an amended 
protocol until that amendment has been IRB/aEC approved.

Documentation of approval signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB/aEC must be sent 
to TRIO (or its designee) or the Sponsor.  If the revision is an administrative letter, investigators 
must inform and obtain approval from their IRB/aEC before implementation.

Study site participation may be discontinued if ImClone, the investigator, or the ethical review 
board (ERB) of the study site judges it necessary for medical, safety, regulatory, ethical, or other 
reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations and GCP.

13.4 Patient Information and Consent

Written informed consent will be given by each patient before entering the study, in accordance 
with FDA regulations (21 CFR Parts 50.20 through 50.27), ICH guidelines as implemented in 
the European Union, GCP guidelines, and/or applicable local regulatory requirements.

The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the patient understands the potential risks and 
benefits of participating  in the  study,  including answering any questions the patient  may  have 
throughout the study and sharing in a timely manner any new information that may be relevant to 
the patient’s willingness to participate in the trial

The  Informed  Consent  Form  (ICF)  will  be  used  to  explain  the  potential  risks  and  benefits  of 
study participation to the patient in simple terms before the patient is entered into the study, and 
to document that the patient is satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of 
participating in the study and desires to participate in the study

The  investigator is responsible  for ensuring that informed consent  is given  by  each patient or 
legal representative. This includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the ICF prior 
to the performance of protocol procedures and prior to the administration of study drug. 

Investigators must ensure that patients are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks,  and  other  critical  issues  regarding  clinical  trials  in  which  they  volunteer  to  participate
before receiving any protocol specific tests.

13.4.1

Informed Consent Procedures

As used in this protocol, the term “informed consent” includes all consent and assent given by 
patients or their legal representatives.

Preparation  of  the  consent  form is  the  responsibility  of  the  investigator  and  must  include  all 
elements required  by the  FDA, ICH guidelines  as  implemented  in the European Union, GCP,

and/or applicable local regulatory requirements. The consent form also must include a statement 
that  ImClone,  it affiliates, TRIO,  and  the  regulatory  authorities  have  direct  access  to  patient 
records.  Prior to the beginning of the study, the investigator must have the IRB/aEC’s written 
approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form and any other information to be 
provided to the patients.

The  investigator  must  provide  the  patient  or  the  patient’s  representative  with  a  copy  of  the 
consent form and written information about the study in the language in which the patient is most 
proficient.  The language must be nontechnical and easily understood.  The investigator should 
allow time necessary for the patient or the patient’s representative to inquire about the details of 
the study, informed consent must be signed and personally dated by the patient or the patient’s 
representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  The patient or 
the patient’s representative should receive a copy of the signed informed consent form and any 
other  written  information  provided  to  study  patients  prior  to  the  patient’s  participation  in  the 
trial.

If  the  patient  or the  patient’s  representative  is  unable  to  read,  an  impartial  witness  should  be 
present during the entire informed consent discussion.  By signing the consent form, the witness 
attests that the information in the consent form and any other written information was accurately 
explained to, and apparently understood by, the patient or the patient’s representative, and that 
informed consent was freely given by the patient or the patient’s representative.

Imclone or TRIO must approve all ICFs before they are submitted to the ERB and are used at 
investigative site(s).  All ICFs must be compliant with the ICH Guideline on GCP.

Documentation of ERB approval must be provided to ImClone before the study may begin at the 
investigative site(s).

13.4.2 Update of the Informed Consent

The  informed  consent and  any  other  information  provided  to  patients  or  the  patient’s 
representative should be revised whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the patient’s consent and should receive IRB/aEC approval/favorable opinion prior to 
use.  The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the patient

or the patient’s representative of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information 
relevant to the patient’s willingness to continue participation in the study.  This communication 
should be documented.  During a patient’s participation in the trial, any updates to the consent 
form and any updates to the written information will be provided to the patient.

If a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
patient:    (1)  the  consent  form must  be  revised  and  submitted  to the  IRB/aEC  for  review  and 
approval, (2) the revised consent form must be used to obtain consent from patients currently 
enrolled in the study, and (3) the new consent form must be used to obtain consent from new 
patients prior to enrollment.

13.5 Study Monitoring
ImClone,  its  affiliates,  TRIO, or their  representatives  must  be  allowed  to  visit  all  study  site 
locations periodically to assess the data, quality, and study integrity.  On site, they will review 
study records and directly compare them with source documents, review regulatory documents, 
discuss  the  conduct  of  the  study  with  the  investigator,  verify  study  drug accountability,  and 
verify that the facilities remain acceptable.

13.6 Case Report Forms and Study Records

An  investigator  will  be  required  to  prepare  and  maintain  adequate  case  histories  designed  to 
record all observations and other data pertinent to the  investigation on each  individual treated 
with IMC-1121B or placebo or entered as a control in the investigation.  All data reported on the 
CRF must be derived from source documents and be consistent with the source documents, or 
the discrepancies must be explained.

The  confidentiality  of  records  and  information  that  could  identify  patients  must  be  protected, 
respecting  the  privacy  and  confidentiality  rules  in  accordance  with  applicable  regulatory 
requirements.

The investigator will maintain, in confidence, all information furnished by ImClone and all data 
generated in the study, except as provided or required by law, and will divulge such information 
to the IRB/aEC with the understanding that confidentiality will be maintained by the committee.

The CRF must be completed legibly in black ink.  Patients will be identified by initials, birth 
date, and patient number.  All requested information must be entered on the CRF in the spaces 
provided.  If an item is not available or is not applicable, it must be documented as such; do not 
leave a space blank.

The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs.  A correction must be made by striking 
through the incorrect entry with a single line and entering the correct information adjacent to the 
incorrect  entry.    The  correction  must  be  dated,  initialed,  and  explained  (if  necessary)  by  the 
person making the correction and must not obscure the original entry.

The completed CRF must be promptly reviewed, signed, and dated by a qualified physician who 
is an investigator or subinvestigator.  If any changes are made or additional data are added to a 
CRF after the investigator has signed and dated the form, the investigator must initial and date 
the  change  or  addition,  as  well  as,  re-sign/date  the  investigator  signature  page(s).    The 
investigator must retain a copy of the CRF, including records of the changes and corrections.

13.7 Access to Source Documentation
Quality of  life questionnaires will  be completed by the patients, and the  information captured 
directly on the questionnaires (CRF pages) will be considered as source data.

In  addition  to  routine  monitoring,  the  study  may  be  evaluated  by  auditors  designated  by 
ImClone,  TRIO, and  by  government  inspectors who  must  be  allowed  access  to  CRFs,  source 
documents, and all other study files.  ImClone, or TRIO audit reports will be kept confidential.

THE  INVESTIGATOR  MUST  NOTIFY  TRIO AND IMCLONE  PROMPTLY  OF  ANY 
INSPECTIONS  SCHEDULED  BY  REGULATORY  AUTHORITIES  AND  PROMPTLY 
FORWARD COPIES OF INSPECTION REPORTS TO TRIO AND IMCLONE.

13.8 Retention of Data
The  investigator  must  retain  IMC-1121B,  placebo,  as  well  as,  docetaxel disposition  records, 
copies of CRFs (or electronic files), and source documents (including scans) for the maximum 
period  required  by  applicable  regulations  and  guidelines,  institution  procedures,  or the  period

destroying any records associated with the study.  ImClone will notify the investigator when the 
trial records are no longer needed.  If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, 
retirement),  all  records  will  be  transferred  to  a  mutually  agreed  upon  designee  (eg,  another 
investigator, IRB/aEC) who will assume responsibility for the study and its’ conduct.  Notice of 
such transfer will be given in writing to ImClone.

13.9 Financial Disclosure
Financial disclosure information must be provided by all investigators and sub-investigators and 
will be collected by ImClone prior to the start of the study.

To allow for the use of the information derived from this clinical study and to insure compliance 
to current regulations, the investigator is obliged to provide TRIO with complete test results and 
all data developed in this study. 

No  publication,  abstract  or  presentation  of  the  study  will  be  made  without  the  approval  of 
ImClone  and  TRIO.    ImClone  and  TRIO will  review  the  manuscript  to  prevent  forfeiture  of 
patent rights to data not in the public domain.  Prior to publication, the authorship list will be 
agreed upon by ImClone and TRIO. 

For the purpose of the efficacy and safety analyses, the names on the author list will be given 
according  to  the  participation  in  the  concept  of  the  study  design,  accrual  input  (number  of 
eligible  patients  accrued)  by  the  investigators  at  each  center,  contribution  to  analysis  and 
interpretation  of  the  data,  and  contribution  to  drafting  the  article  or  revising  it  critically  for 
important  intellectual  content.    The  maximum  number  of  authors  will  be  determined  by  the 
publication policy established by the targeted journal.

Abstracts  and  publications  will  be  submitted  to the  authors, ImClone,  TRIO and  to the  study 
Steering  Committee  at  least  45  days  prior  to the  expected  date of  submission  to the  intended 
publisher to allow ImClone and TRIO the opportunity to remove confidential and/or proprietary 
information  from  such  submission.    Any  removal  request  shall  be  honored  and  upon  request,

14 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THIS PROTOCOL
14.1 Independent Review of Objective Responses and Progression-Free 
Survival
An independent review of imaging assessments for all patients randomized in the study will be 
conducted  by  an  IRC.    The  IRC  will compare the  prestudy  and  all  subsequent  results  for the 
determination of objective responses and disease specific survival correlates.

14.2 Steering Committee
A Steering Committee will be constituted in order to ensure the appropriate conduct of the trial.  
Members will include the study chairs, representative from TRIO, and ImClone.

14.3 Independent Data Monitoring Committee
An IDMC will be established prior to the inclusion of the first patient in the trial.  The IDMC 
constitution  and  work  processes  are  defined  in  an  IDMC  charter.    The  IDMC  will  perform 
unblinded analyses for futility.  Futility analyses will be conducted when 25% and 40% of the 
expected  number  of  PFS  events  are  observed,  approximately  200 and  318 PFS  events, 
respectively.    A  final  analysis  will  be  conducted  once  approximately  796  PFS  events  are 
observed  assuming  full  enrollment.    The  IDMC  will  recommend  early  discontinuation of  the 
study for futility or continuation of the study for full patient accrual.  The IDMC will meet at 
least twice per year, and when 50 and 150 patients have received at least 2 cycles of study drug, 
died,  or  discontinued  study  drug, and  at  the  time  of  each  of  the  interim  futility analyses to 
perform an unblinded review of the safety data to minimize patient exposure to any unexpected 
or unnecessary risks.  Upon completion of the primary endpoint analyses for the 796 PFS events, 
the IDMC will no longer be needed, as the Sponsor will have been unblinded.  The Sponsor will 
be responsible for future safety reviews.  The IDMC will be decommissioned at that time.  

At the time of final PFS analysis, if the results do not favor the IMC-1121B arm and OS results 
at the interim OS analysis are also not significant then consideration to close the study will be 
discussed.
