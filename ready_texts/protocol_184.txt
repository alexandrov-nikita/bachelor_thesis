Background 

1.1 

Treatment of Colon Cancer with Chemotherapy 

1.11 

Background:  It is estimated that 135,000 new cases of colorectal cancer will be 
diagnosed in the U.S. in 1997 (1).  Two drugs are currently FDA approved in the U.S. 
for treatment of colon cancer:  5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan (CPT-11).  5-FU 
alone, or administered with leucovorin (CF), is active in the setting of advanced (Stage 
IV) colorectal cancer.  The combination of 5-FU and CF is standard therapy in the U.S. 
for patients with resected Stage III colon cancer.  CPT-11 is active in advanced disease 
and is FDA-approved for use in patients with colorectal cancer that is refractory to 
5-FU.  Oxaliplatin (OXAL) is a cis-platinum analogue with activity in colorectal 
cancer that is an investigational agent in the U.S. and Canada.  OXAL, either 
administered with 5-FU and leucovorin or administered as a single agent, is approved 
for the treatment of advanced colon cancer in France.  A comparison of regimens 
which combine 5-FU + CPT-11+ CF, 5-FU + OXAL + CF, and OXAL + CPT-11 is of 
great interest to advance the therapy of advanced colorectal cancer.  This study will 
determine if the complementary mechanisms of action of these three agents can lead to 
augmented time-to-progression and survival in patients with advanced colorectal 
cancer as compared to standard therapy.  This trial’s results will also provide data that 
can be used to help develop future adjuvant trials.  

A number of studies have been reported which establish the response and toxicity 
patterns of each of the agents alone.  The early results of studies in which the agents 
are combined are now available.  This study examines the comparative activity, 
toxicity, and quality of life among patients randomly assigned to one of six 
combination chemotherapy regimens.  The trial is designed so that 2 regimens contain 
CPT-11 + 5-FU + CF, 2 regimens contain OXAL + 5-FU + CF, and 1 regimen contains 
CPT-11 + OXAL.  In the initial phase of this trial all 5 of these regimens will be 
compared to a control regimen of 5-FU + CF.  In the second phase of the trial, 
comparisons will be made between the most effective treatment regimens. 

1.2 

Studies of 5-FU Alone and With CF in Advanced Colorectal Cancer 

 

1.21 

5-FU activity can be incorporated into RNA and DNA and inhibits the enzyme 
thymidylate synthase (TS), thus, interfering with the formation of new strands of DNA 
during replication (2).  CF is a reduced folate which when combined with 5-FU 
augments 5-FU cytotoxicity by increasing the inhibition of TS by the 5-FU metabolite 
FdUMP (3).  The role of 5-FU in the treatment of colorectal cancer has been explored 
for over 40 years.  Modulation of 5-FU by CF has been demonstrated to improve the 
response rate but not to improve the median survival over bolus therapy with 5-FU 
alone (4).  5-FU with CF has become standard for treating patients with advanced 
colon cancer in the non-study setting.

Addendum 22 

Many investigations have focused on trying to determine the optimal dose and 
schedule for administration of either 5-FU alone or the two drugs in combination.  The 
method of 5-FU administration has ranged from bolus IV injection to continuous IV 
infusion.  When given, CF is administered in doses ranging from 20 mg/m2 to 500 
mg/m2 per dose.  Commonly used regimens are listed in Table 1.

Comparative data regarding toxicity and activity are available for some but not all of 
these regimens.  The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) reported on a randomized 
phase II trial looking at seven different regimens including regimens 1 and 7 above 
(12).  Grade 3 and 4 mucositis and myelosuppression were more frequent for the 
Mayo/NCCTG regimen (5) and activity was comparable although sample sizes were 
limited in this phase II trial.  SWOG adopted the Lokich regimen (11) as its standard 
regimen for further clinical study based on the favorable toxicity profile. Lokich 
compared continuous infusion regimen to 5-FU alone (no CF) and reported a 30% 
response rate to infusion and 7% response rate to bolus 5-FU. 

 

A randomized study (in progress) compares the Diaz-Rubio (10) and the 
Mayo/NCCTG regimens (5) in the advanced disease setting.  In a comparison of the 
De Gramont and Mayo/NCCTG regimens, the former had a 32.6% response rate and 
the latter a 14.4 % response rate with less toxicity noted for the De Gramont program 
(8).  Despite the response differences, there was no survival difference noted.  The 
optimal method for administration of 5-FU by 24 or 48 hours, 5 days, or continuous 
infusion remains to be determined.  Clearly the maximal dose intensity of 5-FU 
delivery is achieved when the drug is administered over 24 to 48 hours.

Addendum 22 

 

Among 91 patients, the Kohne regimen (9) produced a response rate of 44% (95% 
confidence interval:  24-54%) in a multi-institution randomized study.

The toxicity adverse experiences associated with the clinical use of 5-FU are well 
described in the literature, see Section 15.3. 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

1.3 

Background Pharmacologic Information on CPT-11 and OXAL 

 

 

 

1.31  CPT 11:  CPT-11 works principally by binding and stabilizing topoisomerase I as it 

works to uncoil DNA during cell division; this stabilized complex of inhibitor-enzyme-
DNA halts advancing replication forks, resulting in double-stranded DNA breaks and 
consequent apoptosis (13).   

 

CPT-11 is converted by carboxylesterases to its more active metabolite, SN-38 
(14,15).  A reversible, pH-dependent hydrolysis converts the closed lactone E ring 
form of both CPT-11 and SN-38 to the open carboxylate form of each compound.  
Only the closed ring (lactone) forms of CPT-11 and SN-38 are effective 
topoisomerase I inhibitors.  The mean terminal half-life of SN-38 in plasma is longer 
than that for CPT-11; the respective half-lives for the lactone forms are 11.5 ± 3.8 
hours and 6.8 ± 2.2 hours.  The time-to-peak concentrations of SN-38 is highly 
variable between patients, occurring 30 to 90 minutes after the end of infusion (16).  
Murine studies suggest that the liver may concentrate CPT-11, convert CPT-11 to SN-
38, and eliminate both compounds as well as the glucuronide conjugate of SN-38 via 
biliary secretion.  In rats, 55% of radiolabeled CPT-11 was excreted unchanged in the 
bile within 24 hours, while 21.7% was transformed to SN-38.  Overall, 73% of the 
radioactivity could be recovered from the feces of rats and 25% from the urine.  It 
recently was demonstrated that plasma concentrations of SN-38-glucuronide (an 
inactive metabolite) in patients occur 0.5 to 3 hours after the SN-38 peak and plasma 
levels generally exceeded that of SN-38 (17).  Bile concentrations of CPT-11 were 
10- to 60-fold higher than plasma concentrations in one patient during the first six 
hours following administration, while bile concentrations of SN-38 were 2- to 9-fold 
higher (16).  Renal clearance does not appear to be a major route of elimination for 
these compounds in humans (17). 

1.32  Oxaliplatin:  OXAL (trans-l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane oxalatoplatinum) is a novel 
antineoplastic platinum derivative with a 1,2-diaminocyclohexane [DACH] carrier 
ligand.  Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, platinum compounds 
are thought to exert their cytotoxic effects through the formation of DNA adducts that 
block both DNA replication and transcription, resulting in cell death in actively 
dividing cells as well as the induction of apoptosis.  Like cisplatin, OXAL reacts with 
DNA, forming mainly platinated intra-strand links with two adjacent guanines or a 
guanine adjacent to an adenine (18,19,20).  However, DACH-platinum adducts formed 
by OXAL are apparently more effective at inhibiting DNA synthesis (20,21) and are 
more cytotoxic than cis-diammine-platinum adducts formed from cisplatin and 
carboplatin (20,21,22).  The pharmacokinetics of platinum were evaluated in patients 
with advanced cancer who received 130 mg/m2 OXAL via a 2-hour infusion every 3 
weeks for 1 to 5 cycles.

Addendum 22 

Platinum levels were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry 
with a limit of detection of 1 ng/mL in plasma ultrafiltrate (23).  OXAL-derived 
platinum was distributed extensively from plasma.  No accumulation of platinum was 
observed in plasma ultrafiltrate (i.e., the fraction that contains active platinum).  Some 
accumulation of platinum was seen in erythrocytes after three courses of OXAL 
therapy.  However, this accumulation is considered to be of no clinical significance 
due to the irreversible binding of platinum to red blood cells.  Plasma protein binding 
was high (>99% by cycle 5) and did not change throughout five cycles of therapy.  The 
elimination of total platinum was slow, with approximately 33% eliminated within 48 
hours.  Fecal elimination accounted for less than 3% of the total platinum administered 
(24).  Total plasma platinum concentration from OXAL administration (seven courses 
of 2-hour therapy every three weeks administered concomitantly with 5-FU/LV 
weekly) does not accumulate substantially (23). 

1.4 

Trials of Single Agent CPT-11 or OXAL in Patients with Colorectal Cancer  

 

 

 

 

 

1.41  CPT-11:  A number of phase II studies have been reported in which patients with 

metastatic colorectal cancer received CPT-11 administered weekly, every other week, 
or every three weeks. 

1.411  Early Clinical Studies 

In the first published clinical study of CPT-11 in human colon cancer, Shimada 
reported on 67 Japanese patients, 46 of who had prior 5-FU treatment for 
advanced disease.  Subjects received CPT-11 100 mg/m2 once weekly, or 
150 mg/m2 once every other week (25).  Seventeen partial responses (27% 
response rate) were observed in the 63 who could be evaluated (95% 
confidence interval:  16-38%).  The median duration of response was four 
months.  Therapy was well-tolerated with the most common Grade 3-4 
toxicities experienced being leukopenia (16.1% of courses), anemia (14.5%), 
diarrhea (12.9%), nausea/vomiting (12.7%), and alopecia (11.1%).  The 
response rates and toxicities were comparable for the two-dosing schedules. 

1.412  Studies administering treatment weekly for four of six weeks 

 

 

Several phase II studies have used (26-30) CPT-11 at a starting dose of 
125 mg/m2 with treatment given weekly for four consecutive weeks, followed 
by a two-week rest period, prior to initiation of the next cycle.  A 23% 
response rate (95% confidence interval:  10-36%) was noted.  Response rates 
in previously treated patients ranged from 9% to 23%; in previously untreated 
patients from 26% to 32% (see Table 2, this section).  In these studies, 
diarrhea and leukopenia were the most frequently encountered Grade 3-4 
toxicities. The introduction of intensive use of loperamide into these trials 
reduced the severity of Grade 3-4 diarrhea (27).

A total of 213 French patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were treated at 
a starting dose of 350 mg/m2.  Therapy was administered every three weeks 
(31).  Of 178 previously-treated patients who could be evaluated, 32 (18%), 
(95% confidence interval:  12.6%-24.4%) achieved responses including 4 
complete responses.  Median duration of response was 9 months.  Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia was observed in 18% of cycles, leukopenia in 11%, and delayed 
diarrhea in 11%.  Responses were seen in 5-FU refractory patients which, the 
authors felt, suggests a lack of cross-resistance between CPT-11 and 5-FU. 
In the U.S., Pitot et al., determined a phase II dose of 320 mg/m2 every three 
weeks, which is somewhat lower than the phase II starting dose of 350 mg/m2 
recommended in Europe (32). 

1.42  OXAL 
 
 

1.421  Early Clinical Studies 
 

The safety profile of OXAL was evaluated in a phase I intra-patient escalation 
study of 44 patients with advanced cancer (33), who received 116 courses of 
OXAL through seven levels, from 45 mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2 every four weeks.  
The duration of administration was increased from 1 to 6 hours for doses of 
>60 mg/m2 in an effort to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity.  OXAL was 
administered without pre-hydration or post-hydration.  Initially, all patients 
experienced nausea and vomiting, as reported in an earlier study by Mathé et 
al., (34).  As a result, systematic pretreatment with antiemetics was given to all 
patients receiving ≥90 mg/m2 OXAL, which reduced Grade 3 or 4 nausea and 
vomiting to 11% (33).  Diarrhea was mild (primarily Grade 1 or 2 in 24% of 
therapy courses).  Hematologic toxicity was moderate.  Grade 1 or 2 
thrombocytopenia was dose related and occurred in 13% of patients receiving 
from 135 to 150 mg/m2, and 28.5% of patients receiving from 175 to 
200 mg/m2.  Similarly, only Grade 1 or 2 neutropenia was observed, and 
hemoglobin levels remained unchanged (33).  The recommended phase II dose 
was 135 mg/m2 administered over at least 1 hour every four weeks (33).  These 
findings were confirmed in other trials (34-38).

Addendum 22 

 

 

 

 

 

The dose-limiting side-effect of OXAL therapy was a transient peripheral 
neuropathy manifesting as paresthesia in the fingers, hands, toes and lips, as 
well as dysesthesias in the forearms, legs, mouth and throat triggered or 
enhanced by exposure to cold (33).  This toxicity usually appeared at doses 
≥90 mg/m2 and affected up to 75% of patients treated with 200 mg/m2. 

1.422  The efficacy of OXAL monotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal 

cancer was evaluated in five phase II trials, two with 63 previously untreated 
patients and three with 139 patients with metastatic disease previously treated 
with and mostly refractory to 5-FU (39-43).  The objective response rate 
achieved with OXAL as first-line therapy averaged 18% while that of OXAL 
as second-line therapy averaged 10%.

In Vitro Studies   

 

A number of studies of CPT-11 plus 5-FU have been done in vitro using cell 
cultures to explore the possibility of synergistic interactions between the two 
compounds.  Erlichman et al., examined the interactions of SN-38 (the active 
metabolite of CPT-11) plus 5-FU and leucovorin in HCT-8 cells in a variety of 
sequences (44).  Synergy was noted when SN-38 exposure preceded 5-FU 
exposure and antagonism was noted with the reverse sequence.  Guichard et 
al., and Mans et al., reported similar findings (45,46). 

1.512  Human Studies of CPT-11 Combined With 5-FU and CF 

 

1.5121  Bolus Schedules 

 

The regimen developed by Saltz et al., is being extensively tested in 
the U.S. (47).  The Saltz regimen consists of CPT-11 administered at 
125 mg/m2/dose over 90 minutes + 5-FU 500 mg/m2/dose and 
CF 20 mg/m2/dose given by IV bolus weekly for 4 weeks repeated in 
every-6-week cycles.  In the phase I study, a 17% response rate 
(95% confidence intervals:  2-32%) was observed in 41 heavily 
pretreated colorectal patients.  Dose-limiting side effects were 
Grade 3-4 diarrhea (in 18% of patients) and neutropenia in 29% of 
patients at the recommended phase II dose.  The program is currently 
the subject of an ongoing phase III trial in advanced colorectal cancer 
in which it is being compared to 5-FU plus CF and to CPT-11 alone.

Addendum 22 

 

Fonseca et al., have reported data regarding the Mayo CPT-11 regimen 
from a phase I trial (48).  The recommended phase II dose is:  CPT-11 
275 mg/m2/dose over 90 minutes on day 1 plus CF 20 mg/m2/dose, 
IV bolus, days 2-5, and 5-FU 400 mg/m2/dose by 90-minute infusion, 
days 2-5, repeated every 3 weeks. 

1.5122  Infusional Schedules 

 

 

Ducreux et al., have reported preliminary results of a study 
investigating the addition of CPT-11 to the De Gramont 5-FU and CF 
regimen (49).  CPT-11 is given on day 1 immediately prior to 
CF 200 mg/m2 over 2 hours followed by 5-FU given as a 400 mg/m2 
bolus over 2 hours.  This is followed by a 22-hour infusion of 
600 mg/m2 administered on days 1 and 2 on an every-other-week 
schedule.  The doses of CPT-11 have been escalated from 100 to 
200 mg/m2 to date.  The phase II dose of CPT-11 is 180 mg/m2/cycle 
given on day 1.  Not all patients are evaluable for either toxicity or 
response.  Neutropenia and diarrhea have been the primary toxicities. 

Vanhoefer et al., have reported on CPT-11 combined with 5-FU and 
CF infusion in the schedule developed by Wilke in which 5-FU is 
given in high dose as a 24-hour infusion (50).  The CPT-11 is 
administered immediately before the 5-FU and CF.  CF, 500 mg/m2, is 
infused over two hours.  In the original report 5-FU is infused over 24 
hours at a dose of 2600 mg/m2.  However in a phase III trial being 
conducted in a multi-institutional setting Vanhoefer chose to reduce 
the dose to 2000 mg/m2 because of the observed toxicity of the 
regimen at 2600 mg/m2 and 2300 mg/m2.  Therapy is scheduled weekly 
for 6 weeks with a 1-week rest between cycles.  The phase II dose of 
CPT-11 is 80 mg/m2.

1.52  OXAL Combined With 5-FU and CF 

1.521 

In Vitro Studies 

 

 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

In vitro and in vivo, OXAL has shown additive or synergistic cytotoxic 
properties with fluoropyrimidines (5-FU and gemcitabine), thymidylate 
synthase inhibitors (AG337), topoisomerase I inhibitors (CPT-11 and SN-38), 
microtubule inhibitors (paclitaxel), and DNA modifying/alkylating agents 
(cisplatin and cyclophosphamide) (51-53).  Although OXAL demonstrates 
additive/synergistic activity in combination with many standard anticancer 
agents in preclinical models, some combinations do not demonstrate increased 
in vivo activity and are sometimes associated with increased toxicity (54). 

1.522  Human Studies of OXAL Combined With 5-FU and CF 

 

 

 
 

 

1.5221  Bolus Schedules 

 

The addition of OXAL to 5-FU + CF results in treatment responses in 
patients whose tumors are considered to be 5-FU refractory (55).  In 
115 patients with advanced colorectal cancer that had progressive 
disease after treatment with a bolus schedule of 5-FU + CF who were 
retreated with OXAL + 5-FU + CF.  In order to optimize OXAL 
delivery, treatment cycles were given every three weeks and the 5-FU 
schedule was adjusted to accommodate this interval.  OXAL was 
given at the full single-agent dose of 130 mg/m2/dose.  The dose of 5-
FU administered was decreased by 25% from that patient’s last drug 
dose.  This approach allowed 5-FU to be administered with equal dose 
intensity to that of the every four-week regimen when the drugs were 
administered every three weeks.  Patients had measurable disease and 
scans were independently reviewed.  The response rate was 13%, the 
median time to progression was 4.3 months, and the median survival 
was 10.1 months.  Improvement in baseline performance score was 
noted in 47% of patients and a decrease in pain grade was noted in 
21% of patients.  

1.5222  Infusion Schedules 

 

OXAL administration has been coupled to 5-FU infusion mainly in two 
ways.  In the method developed by DeGramont patients are given a 
loading dose of 400 mg/m2  bolus 5-FU given after a two hours CF 
infusion at a dose of 200 mg/m2 (55).  The loading dose is then followed 
by a 22-hour 5-FU infusion of 600 mg/m2 via a pump programmed to 
provide a constant drug infusion rate.  This program is repeated on two 
consecutive day every two weeks.  In the method by Levi, patients are  

N9741 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

13 

Addendum 22 

given a variable dose of 5-FU depending upon the time of day in a 
method known as chronomodulation (55). 

There are two randomized trials of 5-FU + CF plus or minus OXAL 
where the 5-FU is given according to the DeGramont or Levi regimens.  
In the trial using the DeGramont regimen, 410 patients with advanced 
and previously untreated colorectal cancer randomized to receive or not 
receive OXAL 85 mg/m2 prior to the CF and 5-FU.  In the two-drug 
regimen the response rate was 29% compared to 55% in the three-drug 
regimen (p<0.001).  The times to progression were 5.9 and 8.1 months 
respectively (p=0.0003).  The overall survival may have been 
influenced by second-line therapy and was not statistically significantly 
different between treatment arms at 14.7 vs. 16.0 months (p=0.1). 

In the trial using the Levi regimen CF is given as a chronomodulated 
infusion via a programmable pump at a dose of 300 mg/m2 with 5-FU 
700 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks.  200 patients 
with advanced and previously untreated colorectal cancer were 
randomized to receive or not receive OXAL 125 mg/m2 as a six-hour 
infusion prior to infusion of the above-described doses of CF and 5-
FU.  In the two-drug regimen the response rate was 16% compared to 
53% in the three-drug regimen (p<0.001).  The times to progression 
were 4.4 and 8.3 months respectively (p= 0.045).  The overall survival 
may have been influenced by second-line therapy and was not 
statistically significantly different between treatment arms at 19.4 vs. 
16.6 months (p=0.8). 

In two additional phase II trials, 57 and 40 patients who were 
refractory to 5-FU + CF were treated with the three-drug DeGramont 
type regimen.  Response rates (confirmed by independent review on 
measurements made at least 6 weeks apart) were 22.8% and 17.5%, 
respectively.  Progression-free survival was 5.1 and 4.6 months.  
Overall survival was 11.1 and 10.5 months.  

In one additional trial of infusion 5-FU administration a group of 
57 patients with 5-FU refractory colorectal cancer was treated with 
OXAL 85 mg/m2 plus a 24-hour infusion of 5-FU.  This 24-hour 
infusion schedule is common in Germany where it is known as the AIO 
regimen after the cooperative group, which has advocated its use.  
Usually 5-FU when given alone is administered at a dose of 2,600 
mg/m2 every week.  In this study patients refractory to the AIO regimen 
were restarted on their prior regimen at 75% of the prior cycles 5-FU

dose preceded by OXAL 85 mg/m2 weekly for 6 of every 8 weeks.  
Using this regimen, the response rate (confirmed by independent 
review on measurements made at least 6 weeks apart) was 7%, the 
progression-free survival was 4.1 months, and the median survival was 
10.1 months. 

OXAL combined with CPT-11 

1.61 

In Vitro Studies  

Zeghari-Squalli reported on the results of an experiment in which the active metabolite 
of CPT-11, SN-38, was added simultaneously with OXAL to cells of HT29 colon 
cancer grown in cell culture (51).  Synergy was observed for the two drugs in 
combination using the isobologram method. 

1.62 

Early Clinical Trials 

Two groups have reported in preliminary fashion on their experiences with the 
combination of CPT-11 + OXAL in combination.  Wasserman et al., noted that in vitro 
synergy has been observed when the drugs are administered in combination (56).  This 
group treated 25 patients with escalating doses of the two drugs every three weeks.  
The OXAL was administered as a 2-hour infusion and CPT-11 was infused over 30 
minutes one hour later.  The recommended phase II dose is OXAL 200 mg/m2 and 
CPT-11 85 mg/m2.  Diarrhea and neutropenia limited the drug dose of 17 patients 
evaluable for response; 7 partial responses were observed (41% response rate). 

 

This same group of investigators gave the same combination in the same fashion to 
patients on an every two-week schedule in order to try and increase the dose intensity.  
At the time that the abstract was reported the maximum tolerated dose had not yet been 
reached.  That dose will be greater than or equal to OXAL 85 mg/m2 and CPT-11 
175 mg/m2.  

1.63 

Phase II Clinical Trials 

Scheithauer et al., have reported on 36 patients with measurable colorectal cancer 
refractory to 5-FU who were treated with CPT-11 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 and 
OXAL 85 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle (57).  Patients with 
absolute neutrophil counts of 1,000 to 2,000/uL on days 1 and 15 were also given 
G-CSF at a dose of 5 mcg/kg for 5 consecutive days.  G-CSF was added because the 
investigators note frequent dose-limiting myelosuppression in their phase I trial (57).  

All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response.  42% of patients were noted to 
have a response (2 complete and 13 partial) and 13 were stable.  Median time to 
response was 3 months.  The median survival is not yet available but will exceed 
11 months.  86% of patients required G-CSF.  Toxicity was measured on the WHO 
scale and included Grade ≥3 leukopenia in 12%, ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia 6%, 
≥Grade 3 diarrhea 19%, and ≥Grade 3 nausea or emesis 17%.  Peripheral neuropathy 
was infrequent and mild with 8% experiencing Grade 3 neuropathy.  This trial

indicates that the combination of CPT-11 plus OXAL is active in metastatic colorectal 
cancer. 

In a Phase II trial funded by Rhone Poulenc Rorer, which has not yet been reported, 
41 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with CPT-11 200 mg/m2/day 
+ OXAL 85 mg/m2/day, day 1, every three weeks (personal communication Langdon 
Miller and RPR) i.e., the regimen reported by Wasserman et al. (56).  Activity data for 
this trial has not yet been reported.  Toxicity of grade 3 or greater on a per patient basis 
included neutropenia in 14 (38%) and febrile neutropenia in 2 (4.8%).  Other toxicities 
included diarrhea in 12 (29%), peripheral neuropathy in 0, nausea in 3 (7.3%), and 
vomiting in 4 (9.7%).  In 14% of treatment cycles, neutropenia was observed and 
febrile neutropenia was seen in 1% of cycles.  11% of treatment cycles were 
complicated by diarrhea, 3% by nausea, and 7.5% by vomiting.

1.71  CPT-11 Toxicities in Human Trials 

 

 

 

 

The major dose-limiting toxicities of CPT-11 are diarrhea and leukopenia.  Severe 
diarrhea is most likely to occur after the second or third dose of CPT-11 on a weekly 
schedule.  Among patients in U.S. studies, the median duration of diarrhea was 2 days, 
although among patients developing Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the median duration was 
7 days.  Antidiarrheal agents, such as loperamide, paregoric, diphenoxylate-atropine 
(Lomotil®), bismuth, octreotide, atropine, and scopolamine are typically ineffective 
once Grade 4 diarrhea has occurred.  Early recognition of impending diarrhea and 
immediate initiation of an intensive course of loperamide appears to be the most 
effective approach to limiting the severity of diarrhea (see Section 9.1). 

The most prominent hematologic toxicity is neutropenia.  The simultaneous occurrence 
of Grade 4 diarrhea and Grade 4 neutropenia is rare but may render the patient more 
susceptible to polymicrobial sepsis and, potentially, death. 

Other toxicities that may occur during CPT-11 administration are abdominal cramping, 
nausea and vomiting, alopecia, and asthenia have been reported.  In addition, there 
have been infrequent reports of breathing difficulties occurring in patients treated with 
CPT-11.  Cases have occurred both in patients with primary lung cancer and metastatic 
colorectal cancer (28,29).  The clinical presentation is that of dyspnea associated with 
fever.  Treatment with corticosteroids may be of value; however, some patients have 
died from progressive pulmonary insufficiency, which has been attributed to 
pulmonary toxicity following CPT-11 administration.  The exact mechanism for the 
pulmonary toxicity remains unknown. 

Among the initial 788 patients treated on U.S. trials, there were 39 deaths (4.9%) on 
study.  Six deaths (<1%) were considered possibly related to drug; the rest were 
considered to be due to disease progression.  Deaths were usually related to septic 
events.  Detailed toxicity information for CPT-11 appears in Section 15.1.

1.72  OXAL Toxicities in Human Trials 

 

A review of several studies to evaluate overall safety in 682 patients who had received 
OXAL either as a single agent or in combination with 5-FU (39) was done to delineate 
the character and severity of OXAL-induced neurotoxicity.  Grade 3 neurotoxicity 
presenting as fine movement disturbance or moderate sensitive ataxia was observed in 
12% of patients at a median cumulative dose of 900 mg/m2 OXAL.  (Total cumulative 
doses of 780, 1170, and 1560 mg/m2 were correlated with an incidence of 10%, 50% 
and 75% neurotoxicity, respectively.)  The total cumulative dose of OXAL was the 
most significant prognostic factor for the occurrence of neurotoxicity.  In addition, the 
likelihood that neurologic symptoms will regress has been shown to correlate inversely 
with cumulative dose.  Symptoms resulting from Grade 1 and 2 neuropathy regressed 
in 82% of patients within 4 to 6 months, and disappeared entirely in 41% of patients 
within 6 to 8 months.  In summary, all studies reported to date that the neurotoxicity 
resulting from OXAL treatment was specific, cumulative, and, unlike cisplatin-induced 
neuropathy, was reversible in most patients (38).  An extensive description of toxicities 
associated with OXAL is provided in Section 15.63. 

1.8 

Rationale for the Regimens Chosen for Evaluation in This Study 

 

 

Investigators, members of the NCI GI Intergroup, representatives of Pharmacia Corporation 
(CPT-11), Sanofi-Synthelabo (OXAL), representatives of the NCI, and representatives of the 
FDA have met on several occasions to develop a strategy to compare a number of the most 
promising regimens which combine CPT-11 or OXAL, and 5-FU and also CPT-11 and OXAL 
for testing in a phase III trial in advanced disease.  There has been general agreement that the 
use of CF with 5-FU is standard therapy for adjuvant treatment.  In advanced disease, the 
addition of CF to 5-FU clearly increases the response rate over 5-FU alone (58).  Therefore, the 
5 regimens which contain 5-FU that were chosen for this trial all include CF.  

For the two study arms examining combinations of CPT-11 + 5-FU + CF, the Saltz and 
Mayo Clinic bolus regimens have been selected for study in this trial.  The Saltz regimen has 
been tested in a phase III trial in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.  That trial has 
completed accrual but not yet been analyzed at the time of this writing.  However, the Saltz 
regimen will have the longest follow-up and toxicity data for the combination regimens once 
that data is available.  The Mayo CPT-11 regimen takes advantage of the sequence-dependent 
synergy reported by Erlichman et al., in preclinical studies (44), and to incorporate a regimen 
that is similar to the commonly used 5-FU and CF regimen reported by Poon et al., (5).  These 
two bolus regimens administer the drugs in the fashion that is most commonly employed in 
practice in North America.  CPT-11 combined with 5-FU infusion will need to be evaluated in 
other trials.  Including an infusion schedule would have resulted in a 7-arm trial and this was 
felt to be impractical.

17 

Addendum 22 

For the two study arms examining combinations of OXAL + 5-FU + CF, the DeGramont and 
bolus 5-FU regimens have been selected.  The DeGramont regimen has resulted in the best 
response rates and survival data and is the regimen with which there is the greatest amount of 
experience worldwide.  The bolus regimen administers the drugs in the fashion that is most 
commonly employed in practice in North America.  The development teams felt that American 
investigators and payers would want to know if the added expense and complexity of infusion 
as compared to bolus therapy was justified based on relative results. 

The OXAL plus CPT-11 regimens which have been tested include those reported by 
Wasserman, Scheithauer, and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.  The Scheithauer and Rhone-Poulenc 
Rorer regimens are the only ones for which phase II data exists.  The Scheithauer data 
indicates activity for OXAL plus CPT-11 in combination.  However, the use of G-CSF in this 
regimen is not ideal because it is not a part of the other regimens.  As the activity data from the 
Phase I trial of the Rhone-Poulenc Rorer regimen is also very promising (56), we have chosen 
to use the Rhone-Poulenc Rorer OXAL plus CPT-11 Regimen. 

The control arm in this study was chosen as the regimen of 5-FU/CF reported by Poon et al., 
(5).  In this regimen, the dose of CF is 20 mg/m2, that of 5-FU 425 mg/m2 and both drugs are 
administered by IV bolus on days 1-5 every 4-5 weeks.  This regimen is one of several 
commonly given in the United States in both the adjuvant and advanced disease settings.   
1.81  As first specified in Addendum 2, Arm E consisted of OXAL 130 mg/m2 as a two-hour 
infusion on day 1, followed by 5-FU 320 mg/m2 and CF 20 mg/m2 given IV bolus days 
1-5, with this schedule repeated every 3 weeks.  This schedule was based on a 
115-patient, Phase-II trial in Europe sponsored by Sanofi-Synthelabo.  In the European 
trial, patients who had previously failed 5-FU based chemotherapy had OXAL added 
at 130 mg/m2 to the same 5-FU regimen that the patient had failed on.  In order to 
accommodate the optimal every 3-week delivery of OXAL, patients that had been on a 
four-week 5-FU schedule had the 5-FU dose reduced by 25% from the last 5-FU dose 
they had received, but then given every three weeks.  The toxicities in the European 
trial were acceptable consisting of 10% grade ≥3 leukopenia, 18% grade ≥3 
neutropenia, 10% grade ≥3 vomiting, 20% grade ≥3 diarrhea, and 8% grade ≥3 
neurological toxicity. 

As of October 8, 1999, 16 patients had been randomized to Arm E.  Of these 
16 patients, three patients died on treatment due to causes that are at least possibly 
drug-related.  These three deaths had several common characteristics, and included 
neutropenia, extreme fatigue, and anorexia developing approximately 5 days after the 
course of treatment, leading to death.  Based on this data, on October 8, 1999, an 
immediate dose reduction was implemented for all patients currently being treated on 
this arm, and all future patients randomized to this arm, to what at the time was dose 
level -2 in the protocol (OXAL 100 mg/m2, 5-FU 240 mg/m2).  This dose level is a 
substantial dose reduction in both agents on this arm. 

N9741 
 

 
 

 

18 

Addendum 22 

 

1.82  As of Addendum 6, we have modified the recommended dose reductions and dose-

reduction levels by reducing dose levels for each agent individually and focusing dose 
reductions to specific toxicities for Arms E, F, and G.  This decision is based primarily 
on the initial patient experience on the trial, which indicated that reducing OXAL first 
(as opposed to 5-FU or CPT-11 first) for neutropenia and diarrhea was of limited 
utility.  The dose modifications are now specific to the likely causal agent of the 
toxicity on these arms, with OXAL dose reductions occurring first for neurologic 
toxicities or thrombocytopenia, and 5-FU (Arms E,F) or CPT-11 (Arm G) dose 
reductions occurring first for diarrhea or neutropenia.  This is supported by additional 
unpublished data from Sanofi-Synthelabo indicating that this has been a successful 
strategy in their trials. 

 
1.83  As of Addendum 8, reasons for dropping three treatment arms: 

On March 17, 2000, data was made public at a meeting of the Oncology Drug Advisory 
Committee (ODAC) to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) that affected this trial 
significantly.  At this meeting, the results of two trials that had been presented in 
abstract form at the spring 1999 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO) were updated (76,77).  This new data from two randomized trials indicated that 
the addition of CPT-11 to a standard 5-FU plus leucovorin regimen in the first-line 
therapy of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer resulted in improved patient 
outcome.  The findings were consistent and showed a near doubling of response rate, 
extension of time to progression, and prolongation of survival even when second-line 
treatments were taken into account.  This led ODAC to recommend the approval of 
CPT-11 plus 5-FU and leucovorin as the new standard first-line therapy in this setting 
replacing the Mayo 5-FU plus leucovorin regimen.  

The findings led to consultations between representatives of the NCI, FDA, and 
cooperative group gastrointestinal committee chairs involved in the 6C trial.  
A decision was made to collapse the trial from 6 to 3 arms.  The arms eliminated were:  
Arm B, CPT-11 + 5-FU/LV; Arm D, 5-FU plus leucovorin (the former standard 
therapy arm); and Arm E, the OXAL + 5-FU/LV arm.  These decisions were made for 
several reasons.  First, because the new standard of therapy had increased the response 
rate, time to progression, and survival considered to be expected for treatment in this 
setting, it now appears that the likelihood of a statistical significant difference between 
two regimens of the same drug combinations is a remote possibility, and one not likely 
to be seen with reasonable sample sizes.  In addition, preliminary interim toxicity 
information on patients entered on this study indicated that these three regimens were 
the more toxic of the six choices.  Finally, simplifying the study would make it both 
easier for investigators to explain and patients to understand.

Addendum 22 

In order to reflect the new data that reset the standard treatment in advanced 
colorectal cancer, complete this trial in the most expedited manner, maximize the 
safety of the trial for enrolling patients, and simplify the consent process, the trial was 
reduced to three arms.  No further enrollment is permitted on the three closed study 
arms.  Patients on the Arm D control arm are to be followed for all study endpoints 
but taken off study for treatment at investigator discretion.  Representatives of all 
involved cooperative groups have had an opportunity for input into this decision and 
support it. 

1.9a  Quality of life has been identified as an endpoint second only to survival in terms of 

importance for inclusion in cancer clinical trials (59) and the approval of new therapeutic 
agents (60).  Recently the NCCTG demonstrated that the UNISCALE single-item instrument 
was as reliable, valid, and practical to implement in a community-based clinical trials settings 
as other longer more involved instruments for measuring overall QOL (61).  It is important, 
however, to include other domains so that further detail is obtainable (59,60).  For this purpose 
we will use the McCorkle and Young Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) supplemented by items 
designed specifically for this disease and treatment.  The SDS consists of 13 symptoms:  
insomnia, fatigue, bowel, breathing, cough, concentration, nausea frequency, nausea intensity, 
pain frequency, pain intensity, outlook, appetite, and appearance.  The SDS scale was 
developed for cancer patients and has been proven reliable and valid (62,63,64).  For the 
disease and treatment specific items, we will use single-item numeric analogue scales 
(65,66,67).  This approach has been validated in general by Cleeland et al., in the development 
of The Brief Pain Inventory (66-68), and in cancer patients (65,69) and has been used 
successfully in numerous NCCTG Oncology Clinical Trials (61).  The specific items to be 
assessed include constipation, diarrhea, cramping, pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesias, and sensory 
neuropathy.  Each of these items will be analyzed as separate individual constructs rather than 
as a summated psychometrically validated scale. 

1.9b 

Translational Research - Pharmacogenetic Studies 

 

 

1.9b1  There has never been a more exciting time for the treatment of advanced colorectal 
cancer.  Three distinct therapeutic classes (fluoropyrimidines, platinum complexes, 
topoisomerase I inhibitors) have demonstrated activity in patients with advanced 
disease and preclinical support for improved outcome with combination therapy is 
evident (80-83).  As with all anticancer agents, a subset of patients receiving a member 
of these three classes will have systemic toxicities.  These toxicities have serious acute 
and chronic patient implications, can be an obstacle for further therapy, and are a 
major contributor to the cost of cancer care.  In addition, treatment failure is common 
among patients receiving these agents.  However, there are currently no prospective 
tools for identifying the patients at risk for excessive toxicity or suboptimal treatment 
outcome after anticancer therapy (84). 

1.9b2  A clinically useful biochemical or molecular predictive test should be evaluable on 

accessible tissue (e.g., surrogate for tumor, as biopsies of metastasis are often not 
available), use widely available technologies, and be rapid (84).  Many approaches have 
been taken to identify patient or tumor characteristics that are predictive for response  

N9741 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

20 

Addendum 22 

to therapy or survival without a major impact on current therapeutic decision making 
for advanced colorectal cancer.  However, most studies have evaluated a specific target 
in isolation rather than a comprehensive approach (84). 

1.9b3  Recent clinical studies suggest that genomic solutions are worthy of more definitive 

evaluation.  For example, variant alleles in the thiopurine methyltransferase gene 
identify patients who will experience severe hematological toxicity after azathioprine, 
6-mercaptopurine, or related agents (85).  A similar association is seen with 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) where specific mutations alter functional 
enzyme activity and give an increased risk of hematological, gastrointestinal, and/or 
neurotoxicity from 5-fluorouracil therapy (86,87).  More generalized genomic 
alterations such as tumor microsatellite instability or allelic imbalance in 8p have been 
associated with patient survival after adjuvant chemotherapy for stage B2 and C 
colorectal cancer (88).  Improvements in technology now make genomic analysis a 
more viable option.  High throughput techniques for mutation detection are now 
becoming widely available and have provided a scale of genomic research that was not 
envisioned 10 years ago (89,90).  Together, data such as these provide support for the 
use of genomic approaches to optimizing colorectal therapy. 

1.9b4  The current trial offers a unique opportunity for pharmacogenomic research.  The 

study design included three distinct arms on which patients receive two of the three 
drugs, 5-fluorouracil (with leucovorin and modulation); OXAL or CPT-11.  The 
expected toxicity profile will thus be different for the individual study arms allowing 
questions to be asked regarding association between a marker and risk of toxicity.  The 
availability of uniform information on toxicity, tumor response, and patient survival 
makes it a powerful framework on which to ask pharmacogenomic questions. 

1.9b5 

Insulin-Like Growth Factors:  Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an important 
mitogen required by some cell types to progress from the G1 phase to the S phase of the 
cell cycle (102).  Like IGF-1, IGF-2 may function as an autocrine and paracrine growth 
factor in a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal tumors (103).  IGF-1 and IGF-2 have 
been reported to have potent ability to protect a broad range of cells from a variety of 
pro-apoptotic challenges.  These actions are mediated through the type 1 IGF-receptor 
(IGF-1R), a tyrosine kinase that resembles the insulin receptor (104).  The availability of 
free IGF for interaction with the IGF-1R is modulated by the IGF binding proteins 
(IGFBPs) especially IGFBP-3.  IGFBPs can have opposing actions to IGF-1, in part by 
binding IGF-1 and IGF-2 (105) but also by direct inhibitory effects on target cells (106).  
More than 90% of circulating IGFs are complexed with IGFBP-3 (107).  There is 
evidence that determinants of tissue IGF bioactivity are regulated in parallel with 
circulating IGF level (108,109).  In vitro studies demonstrate that IGF-1 renders colon 
cancer cells resistant to apoptosis (110).  Other studies indicate that IGF-1 protects both 
colon and breast cancer cell lines against death induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy (111-
115).  Six IGF binding proteins (BP) are thought to influence IGF-1 and IGF-2 
bioactivity by direct and/or indirect mechanisms (107).  We thus propose to also measure 
IGFBP-3, which binds 80-90% of circulating IGF-1.  These various observations support 
the examination of the relation between serum IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3 levels and 
outcome in advanced colorectal cancer.

Addendum 22 

 
1.9b6  As of Addendum 16, additional genetic variants in TS have been identified.  Their 
association with 5-fluorouracil efficacy and toxicity will be evaluated.  The variant 
CYP3A5*6 will also be evaluated with the hypothesis that the presence of CYP3A4/5 
allele may be associated with irinotecan toxicity.  See Section 14.0 for additional 
background. 

1.9c  As of Addendum 9:  In a memo from Dr. Percy Ivy (CTEP/DCTD/NCI) dated August 11, 

2000, investigators conducting clinical trials involving OXAL were alerted of eleven cases of 
pulmonary fibrosis with two deaths in patients who received OXAL on Sanofi-Synthelabo 
sponsored clinical research studies.  Approximately 51,000 patients received OXAL from 1999 
to April 3, 2000, the time frame in which the cases occurred.  Eleven cases have been reported 
to worldwide regulatory authorities.  In six of these cases, the pulmonary event was possibly 
related to the administration of OXAL.  Four deaths occurred in these 11 patients, 2 deaths 
were due to pulmonary fibrosis according to the consulting pulmonologist.  Although the 
frequency of fibrosis does not exceed the rate of spontaneous occurrences in the general 
population according to the Sanofi-Synthelabo memo, these cases are reported due to their 
possible relationship to the administration of OXAL.  At the time of this occurrence, no cases 
of pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in this trial.  However, this trial has been modified to 
monitor for such an adverse event as well as unexplained respiratory problems. 

1.9d  As of Addendum 12:  In May of 2001 the treatment program on Arm A, CPT-11 + 5-FU/LV or 

the Saltz regimen was modified.  Patients treated on this treatment in this trial experienced a 
high toxicity rate, including a 4.8% death rate within the first two months of treatment.  This 
result compares to a 1.8% death rate during that time interval in the other two arms in this trial.  
Discussions with leading colorectal cancer experts and the NCCTG External Data Monitoring 
Committee led to the recommendations that the initial doses of CPT-11 be reduced from 125 
mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 and of 5-FU from 500 mg/m2 to 400 mg/m2.  This was the dose reduction 
that had all ready been specified in the protocol for use in cycle two for patients who 
experienced moderate toxicity during cycle 1.  In addition the specification was made that 
patients had to be free of diarrhea or neutropenia at the time of their weekly treatments on 
weeks 2-4 of cycle 1.  Patients who had experienced toxicity during the first cycle of therapy 
exceeding grade 2 were to have doses reduced for subsequent treatments in that cycle.  
Intensive monitoring measures to insure that these changes were effective in improving the 
side effect profile have also been instituted.  Patients beyond cycle 1 of therapy did not have a 
higher rate of treatment related problems since their doses were adjusted in the study according 
to their individual experience.  To retain the maximum acceptable dose intensity on a patient-
by-patient basis, provision for a single-dose escalation to the original regimen is specified for 
patients who experience grade 1 or less toxicity during cycle 1. 

 

Based on this change in dose on what was considered the ‘control’ regimen, it was determined 
that the sample size for the trial needed to be increased.  The original accrual goal of 
1125 patients on Arms A, F, and G was increased to 1525 patients in the following manner.  As 
of Addendum 12, the new accrual goals are 300 additional patients on the modified CPT-11 + 
5-FU/LV regimen, 300 additional patients on the OXAL + 5-FU/LV regimen, and 100 
additional patients on the OXAL + CPT-11 regimen.  The total accrual goal, including patients 
already randomized to the closed arms of the study, is 1705 patients, with the number per arm 
as follows:  original Arm A, 275 patients, modified Arm A, 300 patients, Arm B, 60 patients,

Arm C, 65 patients, Arm D, 60 patients, Arm E, 45 patients, Arm F, 575 patients, Arm G, 
375 patients. 
As of Addendum 12:  In a memo from Dr. Percy Ivy (CTEP/DCTD/NCI) dated March 23, 
2001, investigators conducting clinical trials involving OXAL were alerted to a single case of a 
patient with apparent hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which was identified as possibly 
related to oxaliplatin.  Patients with HCT <25%, PLTs <100,000, and creatinine >1.6 mg/dL 
should be evaluated as in Section 8.1 and treatment with OXAL should be held if HUS is 
confirmed. 
 
As of Addendum 13:  Based on the toxicity observed on this trial and CALGB C89803, an 
NCI-Constituted External Review Group reviewed all deaths that occurred within 60 days of 
study entry on N9741 and C89803.  As a result of this review, several additional changes to 
this protocol have been made, including more sensitive criteria for dose delay/reduction, more 
intense monitoring of fluid and electrolyte levels, and recommendations for antibiotics and 
octreotide (see Sections 4.0, 8.1, 9.2 and 9.91). 
As of Addendum 14:  Arm G was closed to accrual due to achieving the protocol specified 
accrual. 
As of Addendum 15:  The outcome of patients treated on the Arm F appears to be superior to 
the outcome of patients treated on Arm A.  Therefore, we are suspending enrollment to Arm A. 
1.9e  As of Addendum 20:  Intergroup N9741 was the largest U.S. trial to date addressing new active 
agents in advanced colorectal cancer combined with 5-FU.  The trial clearly showed improved 
response rates, time to disease progression, and survival in patients receiving oxaliplatin and 
infusional 5-FU/LV. 
Concurrently, across countries and health care financing structures, there are ever-increasing 
concerns about the economic implications of new treatment approaches in all specialty areas.  
Outside the U.S., economic consequences of these treatments are formally considered in the 
product approval process.  In the U.S., cost implications are actively considered by non-
Medicare insurers and are a factor influencing diffusion into routine clinical practice.  A strong 
case for a retrospective Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) can be made based on the price 
difference between oxaliplatin vs. irinotecan and the need to change organizational behavior 
from office-based to infusional 5-FU/LV.

Treatment 
2.11 

The primary objective of this trial is to compare the time to progression in patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (previously untreated for 
advanced disease) who receive OXAL + 5-FU + CF or CPT-11 + OXAL (the two 
experimental regimens) to those receiving CPT-11 + 5-FU + CF (the control regimen). 

2.12  A secondary objective of this trial is to compare the time to progression of patients 

receiving the two experimental regimens. 
The primary secondary outcome measure in this trial is overall survival. 

2.13 
2.14  Other secondary objectives include evaluation of toxicity, response rate, and time to 

treatment failure. 
To compare quality-of-life parameters in patients on these regimens. 

2.15

2.21 

2.22 

The aim of the pharmacogenetic study is to evaluate the association of allelic variants 
in five candidate genes with patient toxicity and/or outcome (tumor response, patient 
survival) after chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer. 
The aim of the IGF study is to determine whether serum levels of Insulin-Like Growth 
Factors-1 (IGF-1), IGF-2, and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP-
3) are independent predictors of response rate, time-to-tumor progression, and survival 
in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

To randomize a patient, fax (507/284-0885) a completed eligibility checklist to the 
NCCTG Randomization Center between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. central time Monday 
through Friday. 

Patient and Physician Fact Sheet has been given to the patient; treating physician has 
discussed its contents with the patient. 

IRB approval(s) is required for each treating site and a signed 310 form(s) is to be on file 
at the Randomization Center before patient accrual.  NCIC-CTG centres require REB 
approval.  A signed HPB 3005 form for all participating investigators must be sent to the 
NCIC-CTG office prior to a centre being locally activated for patient accrual. 

Patient eligibility and the existence of a consent form will be checked by Randomization 
Center personnel before a patient will be randomized into this study. 
•  Patient has given permission to store sample(s) for future research of colorectal 

cancer. 

•  Patient has given permission to store sample(s) for future research to learn, prevent, or treat 

other health problems. 

•  Patient has given NCCTG permission to give their sample(s) to outside researchers. 

6.3b  Randomization Center will register patients separately to the translational research component of 

this study (see Section 14.0). 
Treatment assignment will be calculated using a dynamic allocation procedure which 
balances the marginal distributions of the stratification factors between the treatment 
groups.  The factors defined in Section 5.0, together with institution, will be used as 
stratification factors.

All eligible patients enrolled on the study by a participating treatment centre will be 
entered into a patient registration log provided by the NCIC-CTG.  This will 
automatically provide a serial number for that patient which will be used on all 
documentation and correspondence with NCIC-CTG.  After randomization, NCCTG will 
also supply a patient identifier which must also be used on all documentation and 
correspondence. 

All randomizations will be done centrally by the NCIC-CTG and will be obtained 
between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday by calling 
the NCIC-CTG Clinical Trials Assistant at (613) 533-6430 or by faxing the eligibility 
checklist to (613) 533-2941.  At the time of randomization, a copy of the completed 
eligibility checklist must be available.  The following information will be required:

The NCIC-CTG will contact the NCCTG Randomization Center to randomize the 
patient.  The NCIC-CTG will then contact the referring institution by telephone to 
confirm the registration and relay the treatment assignment for that patient.  Registration 
will also be confirmed by e-mail, fax, or mail. 
SWOG Group Members and Affiliates:  SWOG Group Members and Affiliate 
investigators will call the Southwest Oncology Group Statistical Center at 206/667-4623 
between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. (PT) Monday through Friday, excluding 
holidays.  The Statistical Center will confirm that the patient is eligible and will request 
the date informed consent was obtained and the date of IRB approval for each entry.  The 
Statistical Center will then contact the NCCTG Randomization Center to register and 
randomize the patient after which the Statistical Center will contact the institution to 
confirm registration.  
SWOG CCOP Institutions:  SWOG CCOP institutions will call the Southwest Oncology 
Group CCOP Office at 206/652-CCOP (206/652-2267), 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (PT),

Treatment Schedules - Use actual weight or estimated dry weight if fluid retention.  See Section 9.6  
in regard to use of cryotherapy. 

Body surface area should be recalculated (current body weight) prior to each cycle if there is a  
change of >5% change in body weight.  Use actual weight. 

When it has been determined that the patient is tolerating therapy without excessive toxicity at a  
stable drug dose level, day 1 of each cycle must be administered at an NCCTG, CALGB, ECOG,  
NCIC-CTG, SWOG or EPP institution.  After day 1, for multi-drug regimens, 5-FU and CF may  
be administered by the patient’s local physician.  In this case, a written statement outlining drug  
dosage, method of administration, follow-up tests required, potential side effects, and telephone  
number to call to discuss any question with the responsible investigator must be sent with the  
patient to provide necessary information to the local physician. 

If patient has a CR confirmed for 2 consecutive cycles, at physician discretion, treatment may be  
discontinued and begin observation.  Such patients should follow the observation portion of the test  
schedule.  At time of progression, treatment may be reinitiated on the same study arm at the same  
dose level that the patient was receiving at time of discontinuation.  At progression, NCCTG patients  
registered to Arm A may be eligible for N9946.  Similarly, NCCTG patients registered to either Arm F  
or G may be eligible for N0048.  Please consider offering these studies to such patients.

Prior to each treatment, the patient must be assessed clinically.  Re-treatment decisions should be based on the parameters enumerated below.  However, 
if, in the judgement of the treating physician, the patient is continuing to have adverse event and further treatment could precipitate worsening of 
unresolved side effects, treatment should be delayed and patient reassessed in one week.  Careful notation of reasons should be documented in the 
medical record/research record.

Addendum 22 

Continuation of the recommended dose modification table for Arm A (Saltz Regimen): 

Other nonhematologic adverse events1,2 
 

Dose modifications for other nonhematologic adverse events during a course of therapy, at the start of subsequent courses of 
therapy, and at time of retreatment are also based on NCI toxicity criteria (CTC Version 2.0) and are the same as recommended 
for diarrhea above. 

If the patient experiences significant adverse event requiring a dose reduction at the start of the next course, then the dose will remain lowered for that entire subsequent course.  If that course 
is completed with no further adverse event greater than Grade 2, then the dose may be increased, at the investigator’s discretion, one level at a time during an entire course in the following 
courses until the patient again experiences an adverse event greater than Grade 2.  When this occurs, the dose will remain one level lower than the dose that caused the adverse event for all 
subsequent courses. 
If a patient requires omission of the week 2 or week 3 dose, the investigator may decide to consider that one of the two rest weeks.  This patient would then receive a 1-week, rather than a 2-
week, break after the completion of 4 doses in a 6-week treatment course (i.e., treat-omit-treat-treat-treat-rest or treat-treat-omit-treat-treat-rest).  The intention is to maintain greater dose 
intensity over the treatment period if possible. 
Some patients will develop adverse event and require omission of the week 4 dose.  In these patients, the investigator may decide to start the next course two weeks later thus shortening the 
course length to five weeks (three-weeks' treatment, two-weeks' rest).  However, all dose modification conditions still apply. 
The dose of CF will not be adjusted due to adverse event.  It should remain at 20 mg/m2 for all courses.  CF will be given immediately prior to each  
5-FU dose; thus, if 5-FU is delayed, CF will be delayed. 
Patient is off study if adverse event requires a dose-reduction step beyond the three dose-reduction steps (levels -1, -2, and -3).

Loperamide:  Loperamide is recommended to treat delayed diarrhea associated with 
CPT-11 therapy.  It is not recommended for treatment of diarrhea related to 5-FU, 
OXAL, or CF.  For patients on CPT-11-containing regimens, Pharmacia Corporation will 
supply Loperamide free of charge.  All patients will be instructed to begin taking 
loperamide immediately at the earliest signs of diarrhea (i.e., first poorly formed or loose 
stool or first episode of an increase from baseline in bowel movements in one day) that 
occur in association with 5-FU or as observed more than 9 hours after receiving CPT-11.  
Loperamide should be taken in the following manner:  4 mg at the first onset of diarrhea 
then 2 mg every two hours around the clock until diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours.  
Patients may take loperamide 4 mg every four hours during the night.  All patients will 
be given loperamide and an instruction sheet to take home on the first day of therapy 
(Appendix VI).  There have been no reports of patients who could not tolerate 
loperamide taken to ameliorate CPT-11-induced diarrhea.  However, should a 
circumstance develop in which there is concern regarding loperamide intolerance in an 
individual patient, use of other narcotic antiperistaltic agents (e.g., Lomotil, codeine) 
may be considered at investigator discretion.

Octreotide:  In patients whose diarrhea is not resolved within 48 hours with loperamide, 
add octreotide 100 mcg SQ, tid, until diarrhea is resolved for 24 hours. 

Atropine:  An early cholinergic syndrome can occur during or shortly following CPT-11 
administration and usually manifests with symptoms of lacrimation, diaphoresis, 
flushing, nasal congestion, or abdominal cramping and occasional hyperperistalsis that 
can lead to diarrhea.  This syndrome may be treated with 0.25-1 mg atropine IV or SQ  
(unless there is a relative or absolute contraindication to its use such as but not limited to 
closed-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, or previous untoward reactions to the 
administration of atropine).  For patients with recurrent problems with cholinergic 
symptoms, up to 1 mg of IV or S.C. atropine may be considered for prophylaxis in 
subsequent cycles.  Additional antidiarrheal measures may be used at the discretion of 
the treating physician.

9.41  CPT-11, 5-FU and OXAL may be is emetogenic.  Dexamethasone, 10 mg IV, 
should be included as part of the CPT-11 pretreatment antiemetic regimen and 
may be included at investigator discretion for CPT-11-containing arms unless 
there is a relative or absolute contraindication to corticosteroids (i.e., diabetes, 
known sensitivity to corticosteroids, severe muscle weakness or myalgias, etc.).  
Other antiemetics, such as Compazine, Zofran® or Kytril® should also be used, 
if clinically indicated.  

Anticoagulants:  Patients who are taking coumadin for treatment of thrombosis may 
participate in this study; however, the prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored 
weekly until stable at therapeutic levels for ≥2 weeks due to a previous report of a 
possible drug interaction (increased PT in one patient on coumadin who had received 
CPT-11).  Subcutaneous heparin or fractionated heparin is permitted.  Patients with long-
term venous access devices who are taking 1 mg of coumadin for prophylaxis against 
catheter thrombosis are not required to have weekly monitoring but monitoring can be 
done at physician discretion. 

Growth Factors:  Routine prophylatic use of G-CSF is not recommended on this trial.  
Use of GM-CSF is not permitted.  Therapeutic G-CSF use in patients with serious 
neutropenic complications such as tissue infections, sepsis syndrome, fungal infection, 
etc., may be given at the investigator’s discretion. 

Oral cryotherapy:  Patients on arms containing OXAL should not receive oral 
cryotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle as this may exacerbate laryngopharyngeal 
dysesthesia caused by OXAL.  (See Section 15.64 for guidelines on the management of 
laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia management.) 

Hypersensitivity:  Platinum hypersensitivity can cause dyspnea, bronchospasm, itching 
and hypoxia (see Table 3, Section 15.644).  Appropriate treatment includes supplemental 
oxygen, steroids, epinephrine, bronchodilators and vasopressors may be required. 

Pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesias:  OXAL may cause discomfort in the larynx or pharnyx 
associated with dyspnea, anxiety, swallowing difficulty and is exacerbated by cold.  (See 
Table 3, Section 15.644.)  Appropriate therapy includes use of antibiotics, cold 
avoidance and monitoring.

care provided until neutropenia and diarrhea resolve.

Persistent abdominal pain, cramping or diarrhea, neutropenia (ANC <500) and diarrhea, 
fever and diarrhea, see Nursing Guidelines Section 15.154 for mandatory supportive care

10.0  Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring 
 

10.1 

This study will utilize the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 2.0 for adverse event 
monitoring and reporting.  The CTC version 2.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home 
page (http://ctep.info.nih.gov/CTC3/ctc_ind_term.htm).  All appropriate treatment areas 
should have access to a copy of the CTC version 2.0. 
 
NCCTG Institutions: 
10.11  Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  First, 
identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTC.  Next, determine whether 
the event is expected or unexpected (refer to Section 15.0, Drug Information) and if 
the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.12).  
With this information, determine whether an adverse event should be reported as an 
expedited report (see Section 10.2) or as part of the routinely reported clinical data. 

 

Expedited adverse event reporting requires submission of an Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS) report.  Telephone notification of NCI and 
NCCTG may also be required.  Telephone and AdEERS reports are to be completed 
within the timeframes specified in Section 10.2.  All expedited adverse event reports 
should also be submitted to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB). 

 
10.12  Assessment of Attribution 

 

When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the 
following attribution categories are utilized: 
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the investigational agent(s). 
 

10.13  When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following 

apply: 

•  When an investigational agent(s) is used in combination with a commercial agent(s), 
the combination is considered investigational.  Expedited reporting of adverse events 
follows the guidelines for investigational agents. 

•  When a study includes an investigational agent(s) and a commercial agent(s) on a 
separate arm, follow the guidelines for investigational agents only if the event is 
specifically associated with the investigational agent(s).  If the event is associated 
with a regimen containing only commercial agent(s), expedited reporting follows the 
guidelines for commercial agents.

Reactions definitely not treatment-related should not be reported.  However, a report should be submitted if there is a reasonable 
suspicion of drug effect. 
Grade 4 myelosuppression or Grade 3 or higher pulmonary fibrosis are to be reported (see Section 10.12).  In leukemia patients, 
aplasia resulting in death (grade 5) must be reported. 
Reporting for this toxicity required during or after treatment. 
Contact Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) (301) 230-2330 (available 24 hours/day) and NCIC-CTG (613) 533-6430 or fax (613)

“Related” adverse events include any adverse event possibly, probably or definitely related to protocol treatment. 
 
For serious and related adverse events that are considered “expected,” an increase in the rate of an occurrence 
which is judged to be clinically important must also be reported. 
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in 
other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death 
or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also usually be considered serious.

10.81  As of Addendum 2, the first 30 patients randomized to Arm B, the sequential 

CPT-11 + 5-FU + CF regimen, and Arm G, the CPT-11 + OXAL regimen, will 
require special adverse event monitoring (Adverse Event Monitoring Report 
Form) during the first two treatment cycles.  Any Grade 3 or 4 adverse events are 
to be reported by fax to the NCCTG Operations office on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 
3 for Arms B and G using the protocol-specific adverse event monitoring form.  
Institutions will be notified at the time of randomization if this provision is 
applicable to each patient.  As of Addendum 6, the Adverse Event Monitoring 
Report Form is no longer required.

10.82  As of Addendum 12, patients randomized to Arm A, the CPT-11 + 5-FU + CF 

Saltz regimen will require special adverse event monitoring (Adverse Event 
Monitoring Report Form) during the first treatment cycle.  Any grade 2, 3 or 4 
adverse events are to be reported by fax to the NCCTG Operations Office on day 
1 of cycle 2 for Arm A using the protocol-specific adverse event monitoring 
form.  The Adverse Event Monitoring Report Form is no longer required as of  
Addendum 16. 

10.83  As of Addendum 16 Grade 1 Adverse Events are not required to be submitted 

(via the Nadir/AE Log) for those Adverse Events observed beyond those 
specified in the table in 10.8.   

Evaluation during therapy 

A schedule of tests and procedures is provided in Section 4.0.  Patients will be seen by a 
physician at the beginning of each cycle on all treatment arms.  In addition, on Arm A, 
patients must be seen by a MD, DO, PA, or NP prior to each weekly treatment for the 
first two cycles.  On the off-treatment weeks, the patient may be seen by an experienced 
nurse or the patient may be contacted by telephone; however, if there are concerns about 
adverse event (worsening medical events or new medical events) during the interim 
weeks, the patient must be seen and evaluated by a physician.  A nurse visit/phone 
contact form is provided and should be kept on file with the patient research record 
(Appendix X).  The form is used at designated times within the cycle as noted in the test 
schedule.

Addendum 22 

11.2 

Evaluable disease 

 

 

11.21  Any evaluable disease will be measured by imaging study that can be assessed as 

to changes in size but cannot be clearly measured in two dimensions (e.g., 
mediastinal mass on chest x-ray; photograph of confluent cutaneous metastases).  
An abdominal mass without clearly defined margins is not considered evaluable. 

11.22  Acceptable imaging modalities for evaluable disease:  CT scan, MRI, chest 

x-ray, physical examination, ultrasound, and PET scan. 

11.3  Objective Status Criteria  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.31  For a patient to qualify for complete response, partial response, or regression, 

none of the factors constituting progression may be present (see below). 

11.32  Complete response (CR):  total disappearance of all evidence of tumor. 

11.33  Partial response (PR):  measurable disease only 

 

 

11.331  Bidimensional indicator lesion(s). 

 

≥50% reduction in the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular 
diameters of the indicator lesion(s), single or multiple sites, chosen prior 
to therapy. 

11.34  Criteria for regression (REGR):  evaluable disease only 

 

Definite decrease in size of evaluable tumor that can be documented by 
photographs, physical examination, x-ray films, ultrasound (US) or other 
imaging modalities. 

11.35  Progression (PROG) 

 

 

 

 

 

Tumor progression will be declared if one or more of the following criteria are 
met. (It is understood that in the event of equivocal or conflicting observations 
that the investigator may elect to declare the patient stable and continue therapy 
on study to gain additional information.) 

11.351  Appearance of new lesion(s).  

11.352  Increase in tumor size. 

 

 

11.3521  Patients with measurable indicator lesion(s) who have met the 

criteria for partial regression: 

 

Significant increase in the size of indicator lesion(s) compared 
to the smallest measurements while on study.

Addendum 22 

Progression will be declared when the indicator lesion has 
increased in size from the smallest measurement by at least 
50% of the decrease in size between pretreatment 
measurements and smallest measurement at the point of 
maximum tumor reduction. 

Example - bidimensional indicator lesion 

Pretreatment - Product of perpendicular diameters = 12 cm2. 

Smallest measurements at the point of maximum tumor 
reduction  = 2 cm2. 

The reduction in the product of perpendicular diameters is 
10 cm2 (12 cm2 - 2 cm2).  50% of the reduction is 5 cm2 (10 cm2 
divided by 2).  Therefore, the product of perpendicular 
diameters meeting the criteria for progression is 7 cm2 (2 cm2 + 
5 cm2).  

11.3522  Patients with measurable indicator lesion(s) who have met the 

criteria for complete response: 

 

Progression will be declared if a measurable tumor mass meets 
the criteria in Section 11.1 or if new lesions appear. 

11.3523  Patients with measurable indicator lesion(s) who have not met 

the criteria for complete or partial response: 

 

>25% increase in measurements of indicator lesion(s) 
compared to pretreatment measurements. 

11.3524  Patients with evaluable disease who have met the criteria for 

tumor regression: 

 

Definite increase in tumor size compared to the smallest size of 
the tumor while on study. 

11.3525  Patients with evaluable disease who have not met the criteria 

for tumor regression: 

 

Definite increase in the tumor size compared to pretreatment 
tumor size. 

11.36  Stable (STAB) 

 

Failure to meet the criteria for complete response, partial response, regression, or 
progression.

If a patient refuses the treatment assignment (and is classified as a cancel), it is necessary 
to provide follow-up information.  The patient will go directly to the event-monitoring 
phase of the study.  On-study material is to be submitted.  Although Southwest Oncology 
Group patients may be canceled by NCCTG, they remain in the Southwest Oncology 
Group database. 

Patients with confirmed CR (CR on 2 consecutive cycles) may (at investigator 
discretion) discontinue therapy to begin observation.  Such patients should follow the 
observation portion of the test schedule for each cycle.  Treatment may be reinitiated at 
the time of progression (see Section 7.4).  Alternatively, such patients may continue to 
receive treatment until disease progression. 

13.21  Observation Phase:  Such patients should follow the observation portion of the 

test schedule for each cycle. 

13.22  Reinitiating Treatment:  Treatment may be reinitiated at the time of progression 

(see Section 7.4).

Pharmacologic/Ancillary Studies: 

71 

Addendum 22 

14.1 

 

 

This study will take advantage of the infrastructure in place for this trial to provide 
complementary pharmacogenomic and serum analyses in clinical samples.  A 30 ml blood 
sample in three vacutainer tubes (two tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant [lavender top], 
and one plain tube [red top]) will be obtained from each patient.  Blood is to be obtained at 
study registration.  Each blood tube will be labeled with a unique identifier and will contain 
no clinical or demographic information.  From EDTA tubes, genomic DNA will be extracted 
using standard techniques, quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy, and stored at 4º prior to 
use.  EDTA tubes will also yield plasma, which will be stored.  Red top tubes will yield 
serum, which will be extracted and stored frozen prior to use.  Complete patient 
confidentiality will be maintained for the genomic DNA samples and serum analyses as only 
the anonymous patient identifier will be available for identification. 

Pharmacogenetic Studies:  Building on the considerable knowledge of the biochemical 
pathways regulating drug activity, a candidate gene approach will be used in this study.  The 
cellular target for 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy is thymidylate synthase (TS).  In colorectal 
cancer, high TS mRNA and protein are associated with poor objective response and patient 
survival (91,92).  TS expression appears to be regulated by a highly polymorphic tandem 
repeat in the TS promotor enhancer region (TSER) (93,94).  This polymorphism is of 
significance as greater in vitro transcription occurs with the triple repeat than observed for the 
double repeat (93).  Patients with the TSER*3/*3 genotype have greater tumor TS protein 
than TSER*2*2 patients (94).  Our hypothesis is that the 38% of colorectal cancer patients 
with a TSER*3/*3 genotype will be more resistant to 5-fluorouracil (93).  Additional genetic 
variants in TS have been identified, including a 6 basepair deletion in the 3’UTR (118).  The 
association of these additional TS variants with 5-fluorouracil efficacy and toxicity will also 
be evaluated.  
 
5-Fluorouracil activity is influenced by the cellular folate pools, which in turn are influenced 
by the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).  A C to T missense mutation 
at nucleotide 677 of the MTHFR gene has been associated with altered tissue folate levels 
and toxicity from 5-fluorouracil-containing chemotherapy (119).  Our hypothesis is that the 
45% of patients with a MTHFR C/C genotype will be at higher risk of toxicity. 

Most of administered 5-fluorouracil is degraded by DPD (87).  High DPD is associated with 
drug resistance while low activity identifies patients at risk for severe toxicity (87,95).  DPD 
is highly variable and mutations have been identified (96).  This study will use 4 DPD SNPs 
to assess the association with toxicity or outcome; DPYD*2 (allele frequency 1%), DPYD*5 
(28%), DPYD*6 (5%), and DPYD*9A (34%) (96). 

Irinotecan is a prodrug and must form SN-38 before it can inhibit topoisomerase I and have 
antitumor activity.  Polymorphic genes have a putative influence on irinotecan cytotoxicity.  
Irinotecan can be degraded to an inactive metabolite (APC) by CYP3A4/5 (97).  Single 
nucleotide polymorphisms, which cause amino acid change, promoter variation, alternative 
splicing and protein truncation have been identified in both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, resulting 
in alterations in protein expression (120).  Variants such as CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*3, 
CYP3A5*3, and CYP3A5*6 will be evaluated, with the hypothesis that the presence of a 
variant CYP3A4/5 allele will be associated with higher irinotecan toxicity via impaired 
inactivation by these enzymes.  Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 are substrates for 
several cellular transporter proteins, including ABCB1 (MDRI), ABCC1, and ABCC2 (121).  
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes have been identified, and our hypothesis is 
that patients with variant alleles will have a higher risk of irinotecan toxicity via impaired 
drug efflux.  SN-38 undergoes glucuronide conjugation via UGT1A1 (99).  UGT1A1 has a 
variable number tandem repeat in its promoter, which is inversely associated with in vitro 
transcription, enzyme activity, and cytotoxicity (99).  The hypothesis is that patients 
homozygous for a 6-repeat unit (frequency 33%) will have a higher risk of toxicity.

Addendum 22 

The pharmacology of OXAL is less well defined.  However, all platinum agents appear to be 
influenced by intracellular levels of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family (100).  This 
multigene family is a key component of detoxifying pathways and is reponsible for 
conjugation of reactive radicals.  The frequency of a deletion in GST M1 (frequency 53%) 
and a single nucleotide polymorphism in GST P1  (AA frequency 51%) will be evaluated to 
determine the influence of detoxification genotype on cytotoxicity and outcome (101).  In 
addition, genetic variation in XRCC1 (122), and XPD (123) have been associated with 
response to OXAL.  The hypothesis is that patients with the XRCC1 Arg/Arg genotype 
(frequency 41%) or XPD 751 C/C genotype (14%) will be more resistant to OXAL therapy. 

Additional genetic variants have been identified in candidate genes which have a putative role 
in regulating the activity and/or toxicity of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, or OXAL.  Additional 
genetic variants of interest to this clinical study will also be identified in the future.  
Association of these candidate genes with toxicity and outcome will be conducted.  In 
addition, analyses will be carried out in those patients with toxicities that cannot be explained 
by the polymorphisms described above.  Those patients will be screened to identify other 
variants in candidate genes that might be responsible for the observed toxicity phenotype.  

Serum IGF Studies:  Our experimental hypothesis is that levels of IGF-1 and IGF-2 are 
inversely associated with response rate, time-to-tumor progression, and overall survival; 
whereas, levels of IGFBP-3 are positively associated with these outcomes.  IGF-1, IGF-2, and 
IGFBP-3 will be assayed in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Pollak using ELISAs with reagents 
provided by Diagnostic Systems Laboratory (Webster, Texas).  This methodology is more 
reproducible than and and highly correlated (r=0.98) with a radioimmunoassay technique 
previously employed (116).  The IGFBP assays do not cross-react with other IGF binding 
proteins.  Blinded quality control samples are included in each batch so that the mean 
intrapair coefficients can be assessed.  The inter- and intra-assay coefficents are 8 and 6%.  
IGF-1 (interclass correlation 0.98) and IGFBP-3 (0.96) concentrations have been shown to be 
stable in chilled whole blood over 24 to 36 hours, the approximate time between blood draw 
and arrival by overnight courier compared to immediate processing and freezing (117). 

Blood samples will be drawn for genotyping of DNA.  Two 10 cc EDTA (purple top) and one 
10 cc (red top) tubes for a total of 30 ml whole blood will be drawn at preregistration 
(baseline). 

See Appendix XVIII for specimen logistics.  Unprocessed whole blood specimens will be 
sent the day of collection to Mayo Central Laboratory for Clinical Trials (MCLCT) for 
subsequent forwarding to the Molecular Genetics (ETV4A) Laboratory, Stephen Thibodeau.

15.11  Formulation and storage:  Irinotecan (CPT-11) is available as single-dose vials 

containing 100 mg in 5 mL (20 mg/1 mL).  Irinotecan is also available as 40-
mg/2-mL single dose vials.  Store at controlled room temperature 15° to 30°C 
(59° to 86°F).  Vials should be kept in the carton protected from light until the 
time of use. 

15.12  Preparation:  The calculated dose is diluted in 500 mL of D5W. 

15.13  Stability:  The diluted solution is stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature 

and in ambient lighting and 48 hours at refrigerated temperatures. 

15.14  Administration:  The dose should be administered as an intravenous infusion 

over 90 minutes (excluding Arm G). 

15.15  Known potential toxicities: 

 

 

 

 

15.151  Hematologic:  Myelosuppression (neutropenia, leukopenia including 

lymphocytopenia and anemia).  Thrombocytopenia is uncommon. 

15.152  Hypersensitivity Reactions:  Hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or 

generalized rash/erythema.  Flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest 
tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, and chills. 

15.153  Dermatologic:  Alopecia, rash, injection site irritation (necrosis has not 

been observed). 

15.154  Gastrointestinal:  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  CPT-11 can induce both early 

and late forms of diarrhea that appear to be mediated by different mechanisms.  
Both forms of diarrhea may be severe.  Early diarrhea (occurring during or 
within 24 hours of administration) may be preceded by complaints of 
diaphoresis and abdominal cramping and may be ameliorated by atropine.  Late 
diarrhea (occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CPT-11 can be 
prolonged, may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and can be life-
threatening.  Rarely, CPT-11-induced colitis has resulted in hematochesia.  Late 
diarrhea should be treated promptly with loperamide (suggest:  loperamide 4 mg 
at first onset of diarrhea, then 2 mg q 2h around the clock until diarrhea-free for 
at least 12 hours).  If diarrhea persists beyond 48 hours, add octreotide, (see 
Section 9.2), consider IV hydration as an inpatient or outpatient.  If diarrhea 
cannot be controlled, hydration and hospitalization should be considered.  
Patients with severe diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and 
electrolyte replacement, if they become dehydrated.  Patients should consult 
with their physician before using laxatives or magnesium-containing antacids. 
 
 

74 

Addendum 22 

Some patients with gastrointestinal toxicity including abdominal cramping, 
diarrhea, nausea, and dehydration, have also developed neutropenia, fever, and 
subsequent sepsis leading to toxicity-related deaths. 
 
For persistent abdominal pain, cramping or diarrhea (grade >2 for > 48 hours), 
ANC <500 with grade >2 diarrhea, fever > 38°C with grade > 2 diarrhea, 
consideration should be given to the use of an oral quinolone antibiotic such as 
ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, or other agents in this 
antibiotic class. The managing physician should use clinical judgement 
regarding the use of these agents in patients who can be managed as outpatients.  
Hospitalization with electrolyte support and intravenous antibiotics is strongly 
encouraged if clinically warranted.  In hospitalized patients, antibiotic coverage 
for both anaerobic and aerobic pathogens  may be warranted.  Antibiotics may 
be discontinued when afebrile for >48 hours, ANC >1000, and diarrhea grade 
<1; antibiotics may be continued at investigator discretion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15.155  Hepatic:  Liver enzyme abnormalities. 

15.156  Respiratory:  Dyspnea.  

15.157  Neurologic:  Insomnia and dizziness.  (Dizziness may sometimes have 

represented symptomatic evidence of orthostatic hypotension in patients 
with dehydration.) 

15.158  Body as a whole:  Abdominal pain and asthenia. 

15.16  Drug Procurement:  CPT-11 is manufactured by Pharmacia Corporation and 

distributed by the DCTD, NCI as 40 and 100 mg vials.  Irinotecan (NSC 616348) 
may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or their authorized designees) at 
each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that drug be shipped directly to the institution where the patient 
is to be treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions  
(unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  Completed Clinical Drug 
Requests (form NIH-986) should be submitted to the Pharmaceutical 
Management Branch by fax (301/480-4612) or mailed to the Pharmaceutical

15.17  Nursing Guidelines:   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15.171  Patient education is especially important.  Ensure that the patients are 

aware of the importance of compliance with treatment for diarrhea 
management.  Stress the need for prompt recognition and early 
intervention.  Motivate the patient to report any complications to the 
health care team immediately. 

15.172  Cholinergic symptoms of lacrimation, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, 

flushing, abdominal cramping and diarrhea can occur at the beginning, 
during, or immediately after the CPT-11 infusion.  It is suggested that 
the patients remain in the treatment area for a minimum of one hour 
following the completion of the very first CPT-11 infusion.  If diarrhea 
occurs within one hour of infusion, refer to Section 9.2 for management. 

15.173  Symptom management of expected nausea or vomiting.  Premedicate 
with antiemetics including dexamethasone and serotonin antagonists, 
unless contraindicated.  Refer to Section 9.3 for management of the 
nausea and vomiting. 

15.174  Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with CPT-11.  Instruct patient to 

report any dyspnea, shortness of breath, or cough. 

15.175  Hepatic enzyme elevations have been transient and have not required 

intervention. 

15.176  Monitor CBC and PLT’s closely.  Leukopenia is a frequent toxicity. 

15.177  Advise patient of possible hair loss. 

15.178  Avoid laxatives or magnesium-based antacids such as Mylanta, 
Maalox, Rolaids, MOM, Mag-Ox 400, and Tylenol with 
antacid unless consultation with the physician has been obtained. 

15.179  Mild dehydration can often be corrected by drinking such sports drinks 
as Gatorade, Powerade, etc.  If patient develops diarrhea, consider this.

volume of stool.  Loperamide should be taken in the following manner:  4 mg at 
the first onset of diarrhea, then 2 mg every two hours around the clock until 
diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours.  Patients may take 4 mg of loperamide every 
four hours during the night. 

15.23  Known potential toxicities: 

 

 

The adverse effects reported during clinical investigations of loperamide are 
difficult to distinguish from symptoms associated with the diarrhea syndrome.  
Adverse experiences recorded during clinical studies with loperamide were 
generally of a minor and self-limiting nature.  They were more commonly 
observed during the treatment of chronic diarrhea.  The following patient  
complaints have been reported and are listed in decreasing order of frequency 
with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions which is listed first since it may 
be the most serious.  Hypersensitivity reactions (including skin rash) have been 
reported with loperamide use.  Other known toxicities include:  abdominal pain, 
distention or discomfort, nausea and vomiting, constipation, tiredness, 
drowsiness or dizziness, and dry mouth. 

15.24  Nursing guidelines:   

 

 

 

15.241  Advise patient to avoid loperamide if there is presence of blood or 

mucus in the stool or if the diarrhea is accompanied by a fever. 

15.242  Advise patient of importance of adequate hydration and proper diet 

while on loperamide. 

15.243  If a dose is missed, advise patient to avoid doubling up on doses. 

15.25  Drug procurement:  Loperamide will be distributed by the DCTD.  Completed 

Clinical Drug Requests (form NIH-986) should be submitted to the 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch by fax (301-480-4612) or mailed to the

15.44  Drug procurement:  Commercially available as a tablet (5, 10, 15, 25, mg), 

cryodessicated powder for oral solution and in parenteral formulations (3 and 
5 mg ampule; 50, 100, and 350 mg vial). 

15.5  Atropine Sulfate (ATROP) 

15.51  Formulation and storage:  Atropine Injection 0.05 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, 0.4 mg/ml, 

0.5 mg/ml, and 1 mg/ml.  Store at controlled room temperature. 

15.52  Preparation:  None required. 

15.53  Stability:  Refer to expiration date on the package. 

15.54  Administration:  Oral Sub-Q, IM, or IV.  Although at least one manufacturer 

recommends that atropine sulfate be given IV slowly and with caution, the drug 
is generally given IV rapidly since slow injection of the drug may cause a 
paradoxical slowing of the heart rate. 

 
15.55  Known potential toxicities: 

 

Blurred vision, clumsiness or unsteadiness, confusion, difficulty in breathing, 
dizziness, drowsiness, dryness of mouth, nose, or throat, fast heartbeat, fever, 
hallucinations, muscle weakness, seizures, slurred speech, tiredness, unusual 
excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability, unusual warmth, dryness, 
and flushing of skin, allergic reaction (skin rash or hives), increased intraocular

Addendum 22 

 

pressure (eye pain), orthostatic hypotension (dizziness, feeling faint, or 
continuing lightheadedness), difficult urination, headache, nausea or vomiting, 
and unusual tiredness or weakness. 

Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of atropine with excitement, 
agitation, drowsiness, or confusion.  Geriatric patients are especially susceptible 
to the anticholingeric side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and 
urinary retention (especially in males).  Caution is also recommended when 
anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of 
precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma.  Memory may become severely impaired in 
geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the 
continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of 
acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions of the brain, including 
memory functions. 

15.56  Contraindications: 

 
 

 

 

 
 
 

Hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs. 
Ocular:  Narrow-angle glaucoma; adhesions (synechiae) between the iris and 
lens. 
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia; unstable cardiovascular status in acute 
hemorrhage; myocardial ischemia. 
GI:  Obstructive disease; paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of the elderly or 
debilitated patient, severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon complicating 
ulcerative colitis; hepatic disease. 
GU:  Obstructive uropathy, renal disease. 
Musculoskeletal:  Myasthenia gravis. 
Asthma:  Atropine is contraindicated in asthmatic patients. 

15.57  Drug Procurement:  Commercially available from various companies. 

 

15.58  Nursing guidelines:  

15.581  Cardiac effects with atropine are unpredictable and paradoxical.  

Average doses (e.g., 0.4-0.6 mg) may produce a slight decrease in heart 
rate due to central vagal stimulation.  Paradoxically, 1-2 mg causes 
progressively increasing tachycardia which may peak in 2-4 minutes. 

15.582  Because slow injection of atropine can cause a slowing of the heart rate, 
it should be given rapidly. Observe patient closely during administration.  

15.583  Store in a tight, light-resistant container at 15-30 degrees C.  Avoid 

freezing. 

15.584  Advise patient that atropine will inhibit salivation and produce 

xerostomia which will last generally less than 48 hours following 
discontinuation of the drug. 

 

 

 

80 

Addendum 22 

15.585  In patients with obstructive uropathy (e.g., BPH), atropine may cause 
urinary retention.  Instruct patient to report any increased difficulty in 
urinating. 

15.586  Advise patient that atropine may inhibit penile erection and cause 

impotence. 

15.587  Atropine can cause a cutaneous vasodilation, referred to as the “atropine 

flush.” 

15.588  Atropine may increase intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure 
glaucoma.  Be aware of patient’s ocular history.  Give drug with caution. 

 

 

 

 

 

15.6  Oxaliplatin (OXAL) (IND 57004) 

15.61  Preparation and storage:  OXAL is presented in the form of a freeze-dried 
powder for infusion in vials containing 50 mg and 100 mg of OXAL.  The 
freeze-dried powder is reconstituted by adding 10 mL (for the 50 mg vials) or 20 
mL (for the 100 mg vials) of water for injection or 5% glucose solution and then 
by diluting in an infusion solution of 500 mL of 5% glucose solution.  All IV 
lines/catheters must be flushed with Dextrose 5% in Water, both before and after 
OXAL administration.  OXAL should be stored at controlled room temperatures 
between 20 to 25°C in the light-proof packaging provided.  As an investigational 
agent, OXAL must be kept in a secure area and may be supplied only to subjects 
treated under the direction of the investigator and in accordance with this 
protocol.  Special drug accountability records must be maintained. 

15.62 

Incompatibilities: 

 

 

 

Do not mix or administer with saline or other chloride-containing solution.  
OXAL is unstable in the presence of chloride. 

Do not combine with alkaline solutions such as 5-fluorouracil (pH 9.2) or other 
alkaline medications (pH >7) or media.  OXAL is unstable under alkaline 
conditions and will degrade. 

Do not use needle or intravenous infusion sets containing aluminum components 
for preparation or administration due to the risk of degradation of OXAL upon 
contact with aluminum.

Addendum 22 

15.63  Known potential toxicities: 

 

 

 

 

Neurotoxicity:  The most commonly observed OXAL toxicity is acute and 
cumulative neurotoxicity, observed in patients treated at doses above 
100 mg/m2/cycle.  This neurotoxicity has included paresthesias and dysesthesias 
of the hands, feet, and perioral region as well as unusual pharyngo-
laryngodysesthesias characterized by a loss of sensation of breathing without any 
objective evidence of respiratory distress (hypoxia, laryngospasm, or 
bronchospasm).  OXAL neurotoxicity appears to be exacerbated by exposure to 
cold.  Patients on this study will be counseled to avoid cold drinks and exposure 
to cold water or air.  Should a patient develop pharyngo-laryngodysesthesia, their 
oxygen saturation should be evaluated via a pulse oximeter; if normal, an 
anxiolytic agent should be given and the patient observed in the clinic until the 
episode has resolved.  Because this syndrome may be associated with the 
rapidity of OXAL infusion, subsequent doses of OXAL should be administered 
as a 6-hour infusion (instead of the normal 2-hour infusion). 

Acute and cumulative neurotoxicities are dose limiting for OXAL.  The acute 
neurotoxicity is characterized by paresthesias and dysesthesias that may be 
triggered or exacerbated by exposure to cold.  These symptoms occur within 
hours of exposure and are usually reversible over the following hours or days.  
Cumulative doses of OXAL above 680 mg/m2 may produce functional 
impairment characterized by difficulty performing activities requiring fine 
sensory-motor coordination; impairment is caused by sensory rather than motor 
changes.  

The likelihood of experiencing neurotoxicity is directly related to the total 
cumulative dose of OXAL administered.  The relative risk of developing 
neurotoxicity was 10%, 50%, and 75% in patients who received total cumulative 
OXAL doses of 780 mg/m2, 1,170 mg/m2, and 1,560 mg/m2, respectively.  Both 
acute and cumulative neurotoxicities due to OXAL have lessened in 82% of 
patients within 4 to 6 months, and have completely disappeared by 6 to 8 months 
in 41% of patients.  In addition, the likelihood that neurologic symptoms will 
regress has been shown to correlate inversely with cumulative dose.  

Clinical ototoxicity occurs in less than 1% of patients following OXAL 
administration, and severe ototoxicity has not been reported.

82 

Addendum 22 

Hematologic:  Single-agent OXAL generally produces only mild hematologic 
toxicity; no Grade 4 anemia has been reported, and less than 1% of patients have 
Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.  When OXAL is combined with 
5-FU/LV schedules for which myelosuppression is dose-limiting, the resulting 
toxicity is greater than that observed with the 5-FU/LV regimen alone.  The 
bolus infusion of OXAL/5-FU/LV may increase the risk of developing life-
threatening enteric sepsis secondary to neutropenia and diarrhea.  Patients with 
grade 4 ANC and grade 3 diarrhea should be monitored closely and 
hospitalization considered for appropriate hydration; treatment with antibiotics, 
appropriate for gram negative or anaerobic sepsis, should be instituted for fever 
or clinical deterioration.  Patients should be monitored closely and provided with 
aggressive supportive care until neutropenia and diarrhea resolve. 

Gastrointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of 
OXAL treatment and require premedication with antiemetic medications 
(anti-5HT 3 medications are effective).  Diarrhea is also common, and 
occurs in 44% of patients treated with single-agent OXAL and 68% of 
those treated with OXAL plus 5-FU/LV.  The addition of OXAL to the 
regimen produces a significant increase in both the frequency and 
severity of diarrhea and mucositis usually expected in patients receiving 
5-FU/LV on an infusion schedule.  Grade 1-2 elevation of liver enzymes 
is common during OXAL therapy.  Elevation of liver enzymes is often 
associated with hepatic metastases. 

Cutaneous:  Erythema or skin eruptions are uncommon with single agent 
OXAL, and the incidence of alopecia is <2%.  The incidence of cutaneous 
toxicity is much higher in combination with 5-FU (overall - 22%; Grade 3 & 4 - 
2%).  When OXAL in combination with 5-FU is administered by infusion, the 
incidence of alopecia is higher (6% overall; Grade 3 & 4 - 2%). 

Allergic Reactions:  Other platinum compounds are associated with allergic 
reactions, but such reactions have been uncommon with OXAL and have varied 
from rashes to anaphylaxis.  Severe allergic reactions were reported in 0.5% of 
patients during clinical development.  One patient has died of an anaphylactic-
like reaction.  In all other known cases, the reaction resolved with symptomatic 
treatment. 

As of Addendum 9:  Respiratory:  Among over 50,000 patients that have been 
treated with OXAL, there have been 11 patients that have developed respiratory 
problems.  Four deaths occurred in these 11 patients, 2 of which were due to 
pulmonary fibrosis.  As the relationship of such toxicity to OXAL cannot be 
confirmed, you must closely monitor patients for unexplained respiratory 
problems (i.e., pulmonary fibrosis, cough, dyspnea, rales, pulmonary infiltrates, 
hypoxia, and tachypnea) and hold OXAL until interstitial lung disease is ruled 
out for cases of Grade ≥3.

Addendum 22 

Other:  A single case of a patient with apparent hemolytic uremic syndrome 
(HUS) possibly related to oxaliplatin has been identified.  Patients with HCT 
<25%, PLTs <100,000, and creatinine ≥1.6 mg/dL should be evaluated in 
Section 8.1 and treatment with oxaliplatin should be held if HUS is confirmed.  
Other toxicities associated with OXAL have been mild.  They include fever 
(with or without infection) in 15% of patients receiving monotherapy and 5% of 
those receiving OXAL in combination therapy.  Transient decreased vision has 
been reported in <0.1% of patients.  No significant cardiac toxicity has been 
observed in patients treated with OXAL.  Three patients experienced reversible 
supraventricular arrhythmias during OXAL administration; one of these patients 
tolerated additional cycles of OXAL with a recurrence of the arrhythmia.  Few 
cases of phlebitis or extravasation have been observed.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
has been reported in a few patients treated with oxaliplatin.  This complication 
may lead to the need for kidney dialysis, usually on a temporary basis.  Fatigue 
and hyponatremia have also been reported. 

15.64  Nursing guidelines (see Section 9.6 for clarification of ice chips use): 

 

 

15.641  GI toxicity in the form of nausea and vomiting is similar in frequency 

and severity to that seen with cisplatin.  This can be severe, but not 
always dose-limiting.  Monitor for nausea and vomiting and treat 
accordingly. 

15.642  Dose-limiting side effect can be paresthesias of hands, fingers, toes, 

pharynx, and occasionally cramps which develops with a dose-
related frequency (>90 mg/m2).  Duration of symptoms tend to be 
brief (less than a week) with the first course, but longer with 
subsequent courses.  Phase I patients have reported onset or an 
exacerbation of paresthesias by touching cold surfaces or exposure 
to cold.  Advise patient of these possibilities and instruct patient to 
report these symptoms to the health care team. 

15.643  These sensory neuropathies developed after subsequent courses with 

increasing intensity (grade 3 toxicity after fourth course) and with 
increasing duration.  In 63% of the patients tested in phase I at high 
doses (135-200 mg/m2), neuropathies became long-term with slow 
reversal over several months.  Disabling walking and hand writing 
difficulties, as well as mouth and throat dysesthesias and laryngospasms 
were seen.  Instruct patient to report any swallowing difficulties or gait 
changes. 

15.644  Laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia (LPD), occurs in about 15% of patients 
and is acute, sporadic, and self-limited.  It usually occurs within hours of 
infusion, is induced or exacerbated by exposure to cold, and presents 
with dyspnea and dysphagia.  The incidence and severity appear to be 
reduced by prolonging infusion time.  In order to minimize the risk of 
LPD, instruct patient to avoid ice and cold drinks the day of infusion.  If 
LPD occurs, stop infusion immediately and observe patient.  Rapid 
resolution is typical, within minutes to a few hours.  This can recur with 
retreatment.

combination.  Advise patient. 

15.646  Mild-moderate diarrhea has been seen -- usually of short duration.  Treat 

accordingly. 

 
15.647  Respiratory problems (i.e., pulmonary fibrosis, cough, dyspnea, rales, 
pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxia, air hunger, and tachypnea) have been 
observed in patients given OXAL.  In rare cases, death has occurred due to 
pulmonary fibrosis.  Monitor lung sounds frequently for signs of pulmonary 
toxicity.  Discuss with M.D. consideration of holding OXAL until interstitial 
lung disease is ruled out in patients experiencing respiratory symptoms 
=Grade 3.  Instruct patient to report any SOB, dyspnea, chest pain, rales, or 
wheezing to the health care team immediately.  Report symptoms to the 
treating M.D. for possible assessment of oxygenation.  This can be done via 
either finger oximetry or arterial blood gas evaluation to confirm the absence 
or presence of pulmonary infiltrates and/or hypoxia.  Treatment choices 
include no intervention, steroids, diruretics, O2, or assisted ventilation.  

15.648  Acute vein irritation can occur with infusion.  Apply heat to arm of infusion 
if you are using a peripheral line.  However, extravasation of drug can cause 
severe pain, redness, soreness, and exfoliation of the skin in the affected area 
with loss of affected vein for a long period.  If a patient has a problem with 
pain or sclerosis when chemotherapy is given peripherally, discuss with 
M.D. the possibility of a central line placement.  

15.649  Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) may result in kidney damage.  
Oxaliplatin is to be discontinued in cases where hematocrit is <25%, 
thrombocytopenia <100,000, and creatinine ≥1.6 mg/dL.

Addendum 22 

OXAL is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by the Division of 
Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI.  OXAL is provided to the NCI 
under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between 
Sanofi-Synthelabo and the NCI, DCTD (See Appendix XIII). 
Drug Ordering:  Once the patient’s eligibility is established and the individual 
has been registered, a supply of OXAL NSC 266046, may be requested by the 
Principal Investigator (or their authorized designees) at each participating 
institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that 
drug be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  
PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior  
approval from PMB is obtained).  Completed Clinical Drug Requests (NIH-986) 
should be submitted to the PMB by fax (301) 480-4612 or mailed to the 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP, DCTD, NCI, 9000 Rockville Pike, 
EPN Rm. 707, Bethesda, MD 20892. 
Drug Accountability: The Investigator, or a responsible party designated by the 
investigator, must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of 
all drugs received from DCTD using the NCI Drug Accountability Record Form.  
(See the NCI Investigators Handbook for Procedures for Drug Accountability 
and Storage at http://ctep.info.nih.gov/handbook/handbook/default .htm) 
 

Statistical Considerations and Methodology: 

Note Sections 16.1-16.5 refer to previous designs of the study.  The current design 
(as of Addendum 12) is given in Section 16.6. 

16.1  Design:  This will be a randomized phase III trial with equal allocation to each of 

6 regimens:  5-FU + Leucovorin (the control regimen), 5-FU + Leucovorin + 
CPT-11 given in two different combinations, 5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL given 
in two different combinations, and CPT-11 + OXAL.  The primary endpoint of 
this study is time to tumor progression. 

 

16.11  Time-to-tumor progression is defined as the time from start of therapy to 

documentation of disease progression.  Patients who die without documentation 
of progression will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of 
death unless there is documented evidence that no progression occurred before 
death.  Patients who fail to return for evaluation after beginning therapy will be 
censored for progression on the last day of therapy.  Patients who experience 
major treatment  
violations will be censored for progression on the date the treatment violation 
occurred. 

 

 

16.12 

In patients with a confirmed CR who discontinue therapy and then restart therapy upon 
evidence of progression, time to tumor progression will be defined as the time from start 
of therapy to documentation of further disease progression following the reinitiation of 
therapy. 

16.2 

Accrual:  Accrual to this trial should be rapid.  The previous NCCTG study in this patient 
population (89-46-52) accrued approximately 160 patients a year.  As the current trial is an 
intergroup effort, enrollment should be substantially increased relative to that study.  We 
anticipate that CALGB, SWOG, and ECOG will each contribute a minimum of 150 patients a 
year, and NCIC will contribute at least 50 patients a year.  Therefore we expect to be able to 

N9741 
 

 
 

 
 

 

86 

Addendum 22 

accrue at least 600 patients a year.  With this accrual rate we plan to accrue 1710 eligible patients 
(285 per arm) for the first stage of the trial in 3 years.  After the 1710 eligible patients have been 
accrued for the first stage of the trial, accrual to selected experimental arms may continue for an 
additional cohort of patients.  Accrual will not be suspended between the first and second stages of 
accrual of this study. 

16.3  Goals:  The primary goal of the study is the comparison of each of the five 

experimental regimens to control.  This comparison will be based on all patients 
randomized while the control arm is open to accrual (defined to be the first stage 
of the study).  The overall type I error rate for comparisons relevant to the 
primary goal is bounded above by 0.05.  The secondary goal of the trial is a 
comparison of the experimental regimens.  The type I error rate for comparisons 
relevant to the secondary goal is also bounded above by 0.05. 

16.4  Analysis plans and power:  In the most recent NCCTG randomized phase III trial 

in this patient population (89-46-52), the median time to tumor progression on 
5-FU + Leucovorin was 6 months.  Several other recent trials have reported 
median times to progression in this patient population ranging from 4 to 6 
months.  In this trial, we will assume a median time to progression of 5 months 
for the control group, and base our power calculations on an exponential hazard 
model.  Based on the calculations below, a total of 1710 eligible patients (285 
per arm) will be required for the analysis comparing each experimental arm to 
control.  After the initial 1710 patients are enrolled, accrual to the control arm 
will cease.  These 1710 patients will constitute the first stage of the trial.  
Accrual may continue to the experimental arms for an additional cohort of 
patients to provide sufficient power for comparisons between the experimental 
arms.  Sample size for the comparisons between experimental arms will be based 
on an analysis which will occur when the 1710 patients necessary for the 
analyses of the primary goal have been entered.  The purpose of this analysis 
will be to determine whether the second stage of the trial should occur, and its 
sample size, not to compare the experimental regimens to control. 

16.41  Analysis and power considerations for the primary goal:  The primary 

goal of this trial is to compare each of the five experimental regimens to 
control.  The primary analysis for this goal will be a comparison of each 
of the five experimental regimens to the control regimen using a one-
sided (unstratified) log-rank test at level 0.01.  This insures that the total 
type I error rate for comparisons with control is bounded above by 0.05.  
Allowing for a 2% rate of lost to follow-up, if we accrue 285 eligible 
patients per arm over 3 years, and conduct the final analysis for the first 
stage of the study after 258 progressions have been observed in the 
control group (at which time all patients will have been followed for a 
minimum of approximately 6 months), each test will have 90% power to 
detect an increase in the median time to progression from 5 months to 7 
months (corresponding to a hazard ratio of progression of 1.4 comparing 
control to each experimental regimen), and 80% power to detect an increase 
in median time to progression from 5 months to 6.7 months (corresponding  

 

 

 

 

 

 

87 

Addendum 22 

to a hazard ratio of progression of 1.33 comparing control to each 
experimental regimen). 

16.411  Interim analysis for the primary goal:  In this study we will conduct a 
single interim analysis designed to provide information relevant to the 
primary goal.  This analysis will occur after one-half of the required 
number of events for the primary analysis have occurred (i.e. after 
129 progressions have been observed in the control group).  This interim 
analysis is designed to A) possibly remove experimental arms, and B) 
possibly remove the control arm.   

 

 

16.4111  A).  At the time of the interim analysis, we will compare each 

experimental arm to the control arm.  If at the time of the 
interim analysis the ratio of the observed hazard rate on the 
experimental regimen divided by the observed hazard rate on 
the standard regimen equals or exceeds one, we will consider 
terminating accrual to that experimental regimen and conclude 
that an advantage for that experimental regimen has not been 
established.  Removing an experimental arm from the trial at 
this interim analysis will result in minimal loss of power 
(<=2% [70]). 

16.4112  B).  At the time of the interim analysis we will compare the 
distribution of time to progression on the control arm to the 
distribution on each experimental arm using a one-sided log-
rank test.  If the one-sided p-value for any of the comparisons 
is smaller than 0.0005 in favor of the experimental regimen, 
we will consider closing the control arm of the study.  This is 
based on the multiple-arm version of the O’Brien-Fleming 
stopping bounds.  This method of analysis also shows that the 
extra conservatism induced by the Bonferroni p-value 
adjustment assures than the final analysis plan for the first  
stage has proper type I error rates despite the interim analysis 
(71).  If this interim analysis results in dropping the control 
arm, we will conclude that the experimental arm that tested 
superior to the control arm is superior to the control arm, but 
not that this experimental arm is superior to the other 
experimental arms.  No conclusions regarding the secondary 
goal of the trial (the comparison between experimental arms) 
will be drawn from this interim analysis. 

 

 

16.412  If this interim analysis results in the closing of the control arm of the 

study, each experimental arm will be compared to the control arm using 
only those patients randomized while the control arm was open.  This 
analysis would occur approximately six months after the control arm 
was closed.  Each comparison would be conducted using a one-sided 
log-rank test at level 0.01.

Addendum 22 

16.413  If the interim analysis for the primary goal results in the closing of the 

control arm, and in addition an experimental arm has been recommended 
for closure based on a comparison with the control arm, then both the 
experimental arm and the control arm will be closed. 

16.414  Release of data at the conclusion of the first stage:  At the 

conclusion of the first stage of the trial and after review by the 
NCCTG External Data Monitoring Committee, the results of the 
comparisons of each of the experimental arms to the control arm 
will be released to the study team to report as appropriate.  
Comparisons between any experimental arms continued into the 
second stage of accrual will not be released until the conclusion 
of the second stage of the trial. 

16.42  Analysis and power considerations for the secondary goal:  The secondary goal 
of the trial is a comparison of the experimental regimens.  To provide sufficient 
power for these comparisons, after the 1710 patients necessary to satisfy the 
primary goal of the trial have been accrued, accrual may be continued to two or 
more experimental regimens (details are specified below).  Accrual to the control 
arm will not continue to the second stage.  The potential sample size for the 
second stage will be based on providing sufficient power for the planned 
comparisons specified in the analysis of the second stage section below, and the 
median time to progression in the arm with the lowest hazard rate at the 
conclusion of the first stage.  Specifically, sufficient patients will be accrued to 
provide 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of progression of 1.4 for each 
planned pairwise comparison, using the lowest observed hazard rate at the 
conclusion of the first stage as the basis for comparison.  The necessary 
additional sample size for various combinations of time to progression and the 
number of arms carried forward to the second stage are given in Table 4.

16.421  Accrual to the second stage:  An analysis will be conducted at the 
time at which the 1710 patients necessary for the first stage of the 
trial have been accrued.  This will be considered an interim analysis 
for the secondary goal of the study, as accrual may continue beyond 
this analysis based on the results of this analysis. The goal of this 
analysis will be to determine if the second stage of accrual is 
necessary.  This analysis will focus only on whether the trial should 
continue to the second stage, and will not be used to make any 
comparisons relevant to the primary goal of the study.  This 
analysis will be blinded to the study team and will be presented to 
the NCCTG External Data Monitoring Committee. 
16.4211  Analysis at the conclusion of the first stage:  At the time of the 
closing of the control arm (i.e., the conclusion of the first stage 
of the study), the potential final comparisons for the secondary 
goal of the trial will be known (based on the first-stage interim 
analysis), and are listed in Sections 16.4221-16.4224.  Also, at 
this time the potential sample size for the second stage will be 
known (also based on the first-stage interim analysis), and is 
shown in Table 4.  At this time two analyses will be 
conducted.  First, each of the planned final comparisons for 
the secondary goal (selected from Sections 16.4221-16.4224) 
will be made.  Statistical significance at this interim analysis 
will be based on a Lan-Demets version of the O’Brien-
Fleming boundaries, assuming that this is an interim analysis 
in a trial with the current number of events designed to 
proceed to the number of events that coincides with the 
appropriate total sample size listed in Table 4.  If any of these 
pairwise comparisons reach statistical significance, then the 
inferior arm in that pairwise comparison will not continue to 
the second stage.  In addition, if five arms were continued at 
the time of the first-stage interim analysis (therefore, 
Section 16.4224 applies for the final analysis), for the purpose 
of determining which arms will continue to the second stage  

N9741

Addendum 22 

of accrual, the following testing procedure will be used in 
addition to the tests specified in Section 16.4224.  If Test 3, 4, 
or 5 of Section 16.4224, conducted at the time of the close of 
the first stage of accrual (with significance levels based on a 
Lan-Demets versions of the O’Brien-Fleming boundaries) 
require that the best regimen from either Test 1 or 2 of Section 
16.4224 is not continued to the second stage of accrual, then 
the inferior regimen from that test will also not continue to the 
second stage of accrual.  Second, we will compute the 
conditional power for each of the planned final comparisons 
for the secondary goal (listed in Sections 16.4221-16.4224).  If 
the conditional power for at least one of the comparisons is not 
at least 50%, accrual will not continue to the second stage. 

 

 

16.422  Analyses for the secondary goal:  The secondary goal of this study is a 

comparison of the experimental regimens.  No comparisons will be made 
between experimental regimens dropped at the first-stage interim analysis and 
those continued at the time of the first-stage interim analysis.  Comparisons 
between arms that did not continue to the second stage based on the analysis 
conducted at the conclusion of the first stage and those that continue to the 
second stage will use all patients entered while both arms were open to 
randomization.  These comparisons are protected by the use of appropriately 
adjusted p-values at the time of the second-stage interim analysis (the analysis 
conducted at the end of the first stage).  Comparisons between the 
experimental arms will be made using both the initial 285 per arm patients 
accrued in the first stage, and the additional patients accrued in the second 
stage.  Experimental arms will be compared using a stratified two-sided log-
rank test.  In conducting this test, patients will be stratified according to the 
stage of the study to which they were accrued (first vs. second).

If two experimental arms are continued at the time of the 
first-stage interim analysis, the interim and final analysis of 
the second stage will be based on a two-sided log-rank test 
at level 0.05 comparing those two regimens continued to 
the second stage. 

If three experimental arms are continued at the time of the 
first-stage interim analysis, the interim and final analysis 
of the second stage will be based on three pairwise two-
sided log-rank tests at level 0.0167 comparing each of the 
three experimental regimens continued to the second 
stage.

Test 5:  Best arm from Test 2 vs. CPT-11 + OXAL

16.5  Revised design as of Addendum 8:   
 

16.51  This is a randomized phase III trial with equal allocation to each of 3 regimens:  

5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 (the control regimen), 5-FU + Leucovorin + 
OXAL, and CPT-11 + OXAL.  The primary endpoint of this study is time to 
tumor progression. 

 
16.52  Accrual to this trial should be rapid.  As of the implementation of Addendum 8, 

accrual from NCCTG, CALGB, and NCIC CTG was 50 patients a month.  
SWOG and ECOG are in the process of opening the study; therefore, we expect 
accrual to rise to at least 75 patients a month (at least 900 patients a year).  As of 
Addendum 8, approximately 135 patients have been randomized to the three 
study arms.  With this accrual rate, we plan to accrue the remaining 990 required 
patients (330 per arm) necessary to meet the total accrual goal of 1125 patients 
in just over one year.   

 

16.53  Goals:  The primary goal of the study is the comparison of each of the 

two experimental regimens to the control regimen (Arm A).  This 
comparison will be based on concurrently randomized patients only.  
The overall type I error rate for comparisons relevant to the primary goal 
is bounded above by 0.05.  The secondary goal of the trial is a 
comparison of the two experimental regimens.

16.54  Analysis plans and power:  In the Pharmacia Corporation trial that supported the 
approval of the Arm-A regimen as first-line treatment in advanced colon cancer, 
the median time to progression on the CPT-11 + 5-FU + CF regimen was 
5 months.  In this trial, we will assume a median time to progression of 5 months 
for the control group, and base our power calculations on an exponential hazard 
model.  Based on the calculations below, a total of 1125 eligible patients 
(375 per arm) will be required for the analysis comparing each experimental arm 
to control.

16.541  Analysis and power considerations for the primary goal:  The 

primary goal of this trial is to compare each of the two 
experimental regimens to control.  The primary analysis for this 
goal will be a comparison of each of the experimental regimens 
to the control regimen using a two-sided log-rank test stratified 
by the stratification factors listed in Section 5.0 at level 0.025.  
This insures that the total type I error rate for comparisons with 
control is bounded above by 0.05.  Allowing for a 2% rate of 
lost to follow-up, if we accrue 375 eligible patients per arm over 
2 years, and conduct the final analysis for the first stage of the 
study after 326 progressions have been observed in the control 
group (at which time all patients will have been followed for a 
minimum of approximately 6 months), each test will have 90% 
power to detect an increase in the median time to progression 
from 5 months to 6.66 months (corresponding to a hazard ratio 
of progression of 1.33 comparing control to each experimental 
regimen). 

 

 

 

 

 

16.5411Interim analysis for the primary goal:  In this study we will 

conduct a single interim analysis designed to provide 
information relevant to the primary goal.  This analysis will 
occur after one-half of the required number of events for the 
primary analysis have occurred (i.e., after 163 progressions have 
been observed in the control group).  This interim analysis is 
designed to A) possibly remove experimental arms, and B) 
possibly remove the control arm.   

16.54111  A).  At the time of the interim analysis, we will 

compare each experimental arm to the control arm.  
If at the time of the interim analysis the ratio of the 
observed hazard rate on the experimental regimen 
divided by the observed hazard rate on the standard 
regimen equals or exceeds one, we will consider 
terminating accrual to that experimental regimen 
and conclude that an advantage for that 
experimental regimen has not been established.  
Removing an experimental arm from the trial at this 
interim analysis results in minimal loss of power 
(≤2% [70]). 

 

16.54112  B).  At the time of the interim analysis, we will 

compare the distribution of time to progression on 

93 

Addendum 22 

the control arm to the distribution on each 
experimental arm using a one-sided log-rank test.  If 
the one-sided p-value for any of the comparisons is 
smaller than 0.0004 in favor of the experimental 
regimen, we will consider closing the control arm of 
the study.  This is based on the O’Brien-Fleming 
stopping bounds (78). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16.5412If this interim analysis results in the closing of the control arm of 

the study, the other experimental arm will be compared to the 
control arm using only those patients randomized while the 
control arm was open.  This analysis would occur approximately 
six months after the control arm was closed.  This comparison 
would be conducted using a two-sided log-rank test at level 
0.025. 

16.5413If the interim analysis for the primary goal results in the closing 
of the control arm, and in addition an experimental arm has been 
recommended for closure based on a comparison with the 
control arm, then the study will be closed. 

16.5414Release of data at the conclusion of the first analysis:  At 
the conclusion of the first analysis of the trial (the time at 
which time to tumor progression is formally analyzed), 
and after review by the NCCTG External Data 
Monitoring Committee, the results of the comparisons of 
each of the experimental arms to the control arm for the 
primary endpoint of time to tumor progression will be 
released to the study team to report as appropriate. 

16.542  Analysis and power considerations for the secondary goal:  The 

secondary goal of the trial is a comparison of the experimental regimens.  
This analysis will be based on a two-sided logrank test at level 0.05, and 
will occur at the time at which the primary analysis for time to tumor 
progression occurs.  This analysis will have >90% power to detect a 
hazard ratio of 1.33 between the two experimental arms.

16.6  Revised design as of Addendum 12:   
 

94 

Addendum 22 

16.61  As of Addendum 12, the initial doses on the 5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 arm 
were reduced due to concerns regarding toxicity.  At the implementation of this 
addendum, there were approximately 275 patients on each of the three arms:  
5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 (the control regimen), 5-FU + Leucovorin + 
OXAL, and CPT-11 + OXAL.  As of Addendum 12, the trial is continuing as a 
three-armed trial of a modified regimen of 5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 for 
300 additional patients, 5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL for 300 additional patients, 
and CPT-11 + OXAL for 100 additional patients.  The analysis plan described 
below includes three analyses:  (1) an analysis comparing 5-FU + Leucovorin + 
CPT-11 (the control regimen) to 5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL and to CPT-11 + 
OXAL using patients randomized prior to Addendum 12, (2) an analysis 
comparing 5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL to CPT-11 + OXAL using patients 
enrolled both pre- and post-Addendum 12, and (3) a comparison of a modified 
regimen of 5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 to 5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL using 
patients enrolled subsequent to Addendum 12. 

 
16.62  For the comparison of the two experimental arms to the control arm in patients 

enrolled prior to Addendum 12 (Analysis 1), we will follow the plan described in 
Section 16.541.  The reduction in sample size from 375 per arm to 275 per arm 
reduces the power to detect a hazard ratio for time to progression of 1.33 for this 
analysis from 90% to 80%. 

 
16.63  For the comparison of the two experimental arms (5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL 

and CPT-11 + OXAL) (Analysis 2), we will use the patients concurrently 
randomized to these two arms  both pre- and post-Addendum 12.  This will result 
in a total of 375 patients per arm.  For this analysis we will use the plan 
described in Section 16.542. 

 
16.64  For the comparison of the modified regimen of 5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 to 

5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL, we will use the 300 patients per arm enrolled to 
these arms subsequent to Addendum 12.  The sample size of 300 patients per 
arm allows 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.4 comparing the modified 5-
FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 regimen to 5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL based on a 
two-sided log-rank test at level 0.05, and the following assumptions:  1 year of 
accrual, 6-months minimum follow-up, and median time to progression of 7 
months in the poorer arm. 

16.65  Safety analysis:  After the first 100 patients have been enrolled onto the modified 

5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 arm, a formal safety analysis will be conducted.  
The rates of all toxicities, including grade 5 events, will be computed and 
reported to the NCCTG External Data Monitoring Committee for all of the arms 
of the study both pre- and post-Addendum 12.  In addition to this specific 
analysis, immediate reporting of toxicity and drug dosing for the modified Arm 
A regimen will be required for cycle 1 for each patient.

Addendum 22 

16.66  Accrual to this trial should be rapid.  As of the implementation of Addendum 12, 
accrual was approximately 75 patients a month.  Based on this accrual rate, and 
allowing time for institutions to reopen the study through their IRBs, we expect 
to be able to accrue the required 700 patients needed to complete the study in 
approximately 1 year.  

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

16.7 

Secondary endpoints and analyses.   

 

 

 

Secondary endpoints include overall survival, time-to-treatment failure, objective tumor 
response, toxicity, and quality of life. 

16.71  Survival 

16.711  Overall survival will be compared between arms using log-rank tests.  
The type I error rates for each survival comparison will be identical to 
the corresponding time-to-progression comparisons as outlined in 
Section 16.5.  Overall survival may be greatly influenced by second and 
third line therapies, therefore, attempts will be made to document any 
treatments received after tumor progression.  Cox proportional hazards 
analyses (including time-varying coefficient models) will be used to 
adjust for covariates for analyses of both time to progression and overall 
survival. 

16.712  The comparison of the survival endpoints for this study will require 

additional follow-up.  In particular, the final analysis for the secondary 
endpoint of overall survival will occur when 280 deaths have been 
observed on the control arm (approximately 18 months after the close of 
enrollment).  Assuming a median survival in the control group of 
14 months, this analysis will have 85% power to detect a hazard ratio for 
survival of 1.33 comparing each experimental regimen to the control 
regimen. 

16.713  Interim analysis for overall survival.  An interim analysis for overall 

survival will be conducted at the time of the primary analysis for time to 
tumor progression.  The significance levels for this analysis will be 
based on the Lan-DeMets version of the O'Brien-Fleming stopping 
bounds, based on the proportion of the required number of deaths (280) 
that have been observed at the time of the interim analysis (79). 

 

 

16.72  Time-to-treat failure is defined to be the time from the date of randomization to 

the date at which the patient is removed from treatment due to progression, 
toxicity, refusal or death.  If the patient is considered to be a major treatment 
violation or is taken off study as a non-protocol failure, the patient will be 
censored on the date they are removed from treatment.

Addendum 22 

16.73  Objective tumor response:  Tumor response will be reported only in patients 

with measurable disease.  An objective tumor response is defined as an objective 
status of CR or PR that is maintained for at least 4 weeks. 

16.74  Quality of Life:  All QOL scores will be translated into percentages (0-100) 

representing the relative position of an individual along the theoretical 
dimension specified by the QOL instrument.  The primary QOL endpoint will be 
the area under the curve (AUC) formed by aggregating the individual QOL  
scores over time.  Secondary QOL endpoints will include the absolute 
percentage change from baseline value to each evaluation as well as the 
maximum and minimum value observed during treatment.  Normality testing via 
the Shapiro-Wilk (72) procedure will determine whether or not parametric or 
nonparametric procedures will form the basis for analysis (two-sample t-test, 
Wilcoxon rank sum). 

 

 

 

Sloan et al., (73) set out a procedure for estimating clinically relevant 
effects for QOL endpoints involving an algorithm using the empirical rule 
and a framework due to Cohen (74) for effect sizes pertaining to 
sociobehavioral endpoints.  From this framework, we define small, 
moderate, and large effect sizes of 3, 8, and 13 units on the transformed 
scale of 0-100 for each of the QOL tools.  These are representative of 
effects equivalent to 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 standard deviations of the transformed 
tool scores respectively. 

Comparison of the QOL tools (UNISCALE, SDS) and individual numerical 
analogue items between the two experimental groups and control will have 
approximately 85% power to detect a difference of 0.3 standard deviations and 
approximately 99% power to detect a difference of 0.4 standard deviations 
(moderately small effect sizes, [74], p. 37) using a two-sided procedure and a 
2.5% type I error rate.  The supplemental QOL items in Appendices XIV and 
XV will be compared across the treatment groups on a per item basis only.  No 
summative score will be calculated or compared from these items.   

Missing data will be handled in a number of ways.  First, all analyses will be run 
using only the data that is available.  Second, imputation will be carried out by 
use of last-value-carried-forward (LVCF) and average-value-carried-forward 
(AVCF) and the analyses run again.  Collectively, these three approaches have 
been demonstrated to be useful for identifying the impact of missing data on 
results as long as the amount of missing data is no more than 20% (75). 

16.75  Toxicity and dose intensity:  Toxicity and dose intensity will be tabulated for 

each arm.

Addendum 22 

16.76  As per Addendum 12:  One goal of continuing the trial beyond Addendum 12 is 

to gather data that can be used to gain indirect insight into the comparative 
efficacy between the original and the modified 5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 
regimens. Given that there will never be randomized data to compare these 
regimens, this is likely best data that will ever be available to compare the 
original to the modified regimen.  Both the original and the modified regimen 
will have been compared to the same regimen (5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL) in 
the same patient population in a sequential manner.  While this is a non-
randomized comparison and the results of any such analysis must be interpreted 
cautiously, we will base any inferences on the following criteria.  Using the 
patients enrolled prior to addendum 12, a hazard ratio comparing the original 5-
FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 regimen to the 5-FU + Leucovorin + OXAL regimen 
will be computed, along with an associated 95% confidence interval. Separately, 
using the patients enrolled subsequent to addendum 12, a hazard ratio comparing 
the modified 5-FU + Leucovorin + CPT-11 regimen to the 5-FU + Leucovorin + 
OXAL regimen will also be computed, along with an associated 95% confidence 
interval.  Any indirect comparisons between the new and modified 5-FU + 
Leucovorin + CPT-11 regimen will be based on a comparison of these two 
hazard ratios, and particularly the amount of overlap between the two confidence 
intervals. 

16.8  Translational studies, as of Addendum 9: 

 

16.81  Pharmacogenomic Studies:  The goal of the pharmacogenomic component of this 
study is to determine if polymorphisms at several candidate genes are predictive 
of various patient outcomes (i.e., toxicity, response to therapy, etc.).  In 
particular, we will test for the association of the following polymorphisms with 
outcome: 

16.811  TSER:  The hypothesis is that patients with a TSER*3/*3 genotype will 
have a poorer response to 5-FU containing regimens than patients with 
the *2/*2 genotype.  Exploratory analyses will combine patients with the 
*2/*3 genotype with both the 2/*2 and *3/*3 groups sequentially. 

 
16.812  DPD:  The hypothesis is that in patients receiving a 5-FU containing 
regimen, DPD mutations will be associated with risk of toxicity and 
probability of response to chemotherapy.  

16.813  CYP3A4:  The hypothesis is that patients who carry a G allele in the 
promoter region at position will be at greater risk for toxicity when 
treated with a CPT-11 containing regimen. 

16.814  UGT1A1:  The hypothesis is that patients homozygous for a 6-repeat 

unit will be at greater risk for toxicity when treated with a CPT-11 
containing regimen.

N9741 
 

 
 

 

 

98 

Addendum 22 

16.815  GST M1:  The hypothesis is that carriers of the null allele in GST M1 

(GSTM1-) will be at differential risk of toxicity and response in patients 
treated with an OXAL-containing regimen. 

 

16.82 

Insulin-Like Growth Factor Studies:  The goal of the IGF component of this study is to 
determine whether serum levels of IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3 are predictive of various 
patient outcomes (response, survival, etc.)  The hypothesis is that levels of IGF-1 and 
IGF-2 are inversely associated with response rate, time-to-tumor progression, and overall 
survival; whereas, levels of IGFBP-3 are positively associated with these outcomes.  In 
exploratory analyses, we will assess whether levels of IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3 
correlate with other clinical predictors of survival.  Moreover, we will assess whether 
levels of IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3 modify the influence of systemic chemotherapy on 
response rate, time-to-progression, and survival. 

16.83  Multiple comparisons:  The translational analysis for this protocol will compare outcome 

measures (toxicity, response, etc.) within several possible genotype combinations on 
polymorphism by polymorphism basis as well as comparing outcomes based on 3 IGF 
markers.  In addition, these analyses will be conducted using various combinations of the 
treatment regimens (i.e., each arm separately, combining the two 5-FU containing arms 
vs. the non 5-FU arm, etc.)  Formal protection for multiple comparisons will not be 
attempted.  However, as a general protection against multiple comparisons, a two-sided 
significance level of 0.01 (as opposed to the usual 0.05) will be used to declare statistical 
significance for any finding.  In exploratory analyses, we will assess whether levels of 
IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3 correlate with other clinical predictors of survival.  
Moreover, we will assess whether levels of IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3 modify the 
influence of systemic chemotherapy on response rate, time-to-tumor progression, and 
survival. 

16.84 

Sample size and power considerations:  As of the implementation of Addendum 9 (which 
added the translational blood draw to the study), approximately 190 of the required 
1125 patients on Arms A, F, and G had been accrued.  Therefore, we expect to acquire 
blood samples on approximately 900 patients or 300 per arm.  Based on the calculations 
below, we expect that this sample size will provide sufficient statistical power for the 
variety of analyses that we are proposing. 

 

 

Analyses will be conducted comparing the various outcomes of interest (adverse events 
of specific types, overall risk of adverse events, objective tumor response, time to 
progression, and overall survival) with patient status on each of the polymorphisms and 
IGFs tested.   

16.841  Pharmacogenomic analyses, dichotomous outcomes:  In the following table, we 

provide general power considerations detecting a statistically significant 
difference in outcomes for various prevalences of candidate polymorphisms and 
differences in outcomes between the patient groups for a dichotomous outcome.  
The sample sizes provided are the smallest sample size for each given prevalence and 
effect-size combination that provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant 
difference in outcome using a two-sided test of binomial proportions at level 0.01,  
assuming the worst case that the outcome of interest is present in 50% of patients 
in one of the patient groups.

Number of patients necessary to provide 90% power, dichotomous outcome. 

We consider differences in proportions in the range of 20% (i.e., adverse event 
or response rates in two groups that differ by ≥20%) to be clinically meaningful.  
The sample size in this study will provide high power to detect differences of 
this magnitude except in the case of a very low prevalence polymorphism.  Our 
review of published allele frequency data suggests that the frequencies of the 
genotypes of interest will be common enough, several in the range of 40% to 
60%. 

16.842  Pharmacogenomic analyses, time-to-event outcomes:  In the following table, we 

provide general power considerations for various prevalences of candidate 
polymorphisms and hazard ratios between the patient groups for a time-to-event 
outcome.  The sample sizes provided are the smallest sample size for each given 
prevalence and hazard-ratio combination that provide 90% power using a two-
sided log-rank test at level 0.01.  These calculations assume one year of accrual, 
one year minimum follow-up, and a median time-to-event of one year in the 
‘control’ group.

Based on these sample sizes, we feel that this study will have good power to 
detect clinically relevant differences in outcome for all but very low prevalence 
polymorphisms. 

 
 

16.843  IGF levels:  The association of IGF levels and the various outcomes of interest 
will be analyzed using a variety of methods.  IGF levels will be analyzed as a 
continuous variable (after suitable transformation to assure normality), as a 
dichotomous variable (above and below the median level), and by splitting into 
quintiles of the distribution.  The median split is the least powerful of these 
approaches.  Power considerations for the median-split analysis are the same as 
for the 50% prevalence columns of the tables in Section 16.731 and 16.732.  
Therefore, we feel that this study will have excellent power to detect clinically 
relevant differences in outcomes for all 3 IGFs investigated. 

Addendum 16 

16.85  Statistical methods:  A variety of statistical methods will be used for the different 

analyses.  Correlation of dichotomous outcomes and genotype or IGF status will be 
tested using chi-squared tests; odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals will 
be reported as estimates of the association.  Univariate logistic regression models will be

Addendum 22 

used to explore the association between continuous variables and binary outcomes; 
multivariate logistic regression will be used to adjust for known risk factors 
(performance status, stage, age, etc).  Associations between genotype or IGF status and 
time-to-event variables (time to progression, overall survival) will be illustrated 
graphically using Kaplan-Meier curves, with hypothesis testing using the log-rank test 
for univariate associations and Cox regression modeling for multivariate associations. 

 

16.9a  NCCTG Inclusion of Women and Minorities 

 

 

 

16.9a1  This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, gender, or 

ethnic origin. 

16.9a2  There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of 

OXAL, 5-FU or CPT-11-based treatment in subsets defined by race, gender, or 
ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect such differences exist.  Therefore, 
although the planned analysis will, as always, look for differences in treatment 
effect based on racial and gender groupings, the sample size is not increased in 
order to provide additional power for ethnic subset analyses. 

16.9a3  To predict characteristics of patients likely to enroll in this trial, we reviewed the 

total accrual into the NCCTG advanced colorectal cancer trial 89-46-52, 
classified by membership, gender, and race.  This demonstrated that 5.2% 
(43/922) of patients could be classified as minorities by race and that 43% 
(396/922) of patients were women. 

16.9a4  However, for more than two years, NCCTG has been taking steps to develop 

clinical and research association with Native Americans, African Americans, and 
Hispanics in the midsection of North America.  We expect that these new 
relationships will soon increase the numbers of those specific minority groups 
recruited into NCCTG trials.

16.9c  Overview of Cost Effective Analysis 

16.9c1  As of Addendum 20:  The planned CEA will use the primary data from N9741 
(efficacy and toxicity) to develop a lifetime projection.  The model intends to 
take a societal perspective and make both a baseline incremental CEA projection 
($ per life year) and a 95% confidence interval range.  A 16-point checklist of 
CE standards will be used (see table on next page).  The lack of differences in 
overall quality of life between strategies eliminates a major concern in 
interpreting the trial results.

TITLE: 

A Randomized Phase III Trial of Combinations of Oxaliplatin (OXAL), 5-Fluorouracil

Adenocarcinoma of the Colon and Rectum (NCCTG N9741)

PARTICIPANTS: 
 
This is an important form.  Please read it carefully.  It tells you what you need to know about this 
study.  If you agree to take part in this research study, you need to sign the form.  Your signature 
means that you have been told about the study and what the risks are.  Your signature on this form 
also means that you want to take part in this study. 
 
Why is this study being done? 
 
The original purpose of this study was to compare several combination chemotherapy regimens when 
given to patients who have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.  The side effects and 
survival experienced by patients receiving these drugs and the effects of treatment on the participant’s 
quality of life (changes to daily routines and feelings of overall health) were also evaluated.  
 
Recently, a group of clinical trials experts and cancer patients have reviewed information about 
participants enrolled in this study.  In this review, a difference in the potential benefits between the 
treatments being studied was identified, with the regimen of the oxaliplatin (OXAL), 5- Fluorouracil (5-
FU) and leucovorin (CF) having a better outcome.  While this information is being further reviewed, 
enrollment of new patients to all other treatments except the OXAL, 5-FU, and CF treatment is stopped 
(please see attached Patient Information Update Consent Form Supplement).  
 
Other reasons for doing this study are to see if genetic factors affect side effects and overall survival. 
 
An optional blood draw of 30 ml (about 2 tablespoons) will be taken ≤14 days prior to the start of the 
study for genetic testing or at any treatment cycle.  This blood draw will be used to look at DNA for this 
study and also stored for future testing.  Because the genetic tests in this study are not used for regular 
medical care, you will not be told the results of the test(s).  The test results will not be put in your 
medical record. 
 
How many people will take part in the study? 
 
The plan is to have about 1705 people take part in this study. 
 
What will happen in the study? 
 
You will get OXAL by vein over 120 minutes followed by CF given over 120 minutes followed by 5-FU 
(given over a few minutes of time) followed by 5-FU given over 22 hours.  The CF and 5-FU are given 
on two consecutive days.  Treatment is repeated every 14 days.  This requires placement of an IV tube 
into a vein under the skin of the chest wall.  
 

Appendix I

Addendum 22 
You will receive a complete physical examination and be seen by a physician or health care professional 
at the beginning of each cycle.  Samples of your blood will be obtained along with chest x-rays and CT 
scans to evaluate your health status.  For the first two cycles, on the weeks you do not receive treatment, 
a nurse will see you or contact you by telephone to talk about how you are feeling and if you are having 
any side effects. 
 
You will continue to be treated until your disease fails to respond to the treatment.  If you achieve a 
complete remission of your cancer, at your physician’s discretion, treatment may be halted and reinitiated 
if your cancer returns. 
 
To study the treatment’s effect on quality of life, participants will be asked to fill out brief forms with 
questions about changes in daily routines and health.  This will take about 10-15 minutes  The forms will 
be given to the participants during their visits to the clinic.   If the participant is not feeling well enough 
to fill out the form, a copy will be given to the participant to take home.  The participant will be called 
within the week to go over the questionnaires and get the answers.  Family members or friends are not 
allowed to fill out the questionnaires for the participant.  Because quality of life may change over time, 
the participant will be asked to fill out the same form a number of times during the study (before starting 
the first cycle of treatment, then before every sixth cycle of treatment, and after the last cycle of 
treatment). 
 
How long will I be in the study? 
 
After treatment has been completed you will continue to be followed every 3 months for the first year, 
every 6 months for 2 years after that, and then once a year after that. 
 
Will any biological sample(s) be stored and used in the future by the North Central Cancer 
Treatment Group (NCCTG)?  
 
Another part of this research study involves storing a small sample of your leftover blood to be used for 
future research studies of colorectal cancer.  The sample may be stored for a long time, even after your 
death.  You have a say in how your stored sample is used in future research.  You can still take part in the 
treatment study without giving your sample for storage. 
 
The possible benefits of research from your blood include learning more about cancer and other diseases.  
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records.  Your sample will be 
stored safely at NCCTG and will be given a code (rather than your name) when it is used in research.  
This code will allow your sample to be used without anyone knowing that it is your sample just by 
looking at the label.  The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small.  The 
sample will be the property of the NCCTG. 
 
The research that may be done with your blood is not designed to specifically help you.  It might help 
people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.  Reports about research done with your tissue 
will not be given to you or your doctor. 
 
Sometimes blood is used for genetic research (research about diseases that are passed on in families).  
Even if your blood is used for genetic research, the findings will not be linked with your medical records 
and they will not be given to people outside of the research process.

What are the risks of the study? 
 
Side effects may be associated with treatment in this research study.  There is potential risk of death 
associated with chemotherapy.  Every effort will be taken to lessen side effects, but there is no way to tell 
which side effects may happen or how bad they may be.  It is possible that unforeseen or unexpected side 
effects will result from combining these drugs. 
 
 
 

Appendix I

Addendum 22 

  
Oxaliplatin (OXAL) can cause nausea (feeling sick to your stomach); vomiting (throwing up); diarrhea 
(frequent bowel movements).  In some patients OXAL has caused vomiting and nausea associated with 
temporary inactivity of the muscles in the intestines.  This generally disappears by itself but some 
patients have required hospitalization for administration of fluids by vein to prevent dehydration until the 
bowel function recovers.  OXAL may also cause some unusual feelings:  numbness or tingling in the 
hands and feet (this is intensified with exposure to cold) or a feeling of tightness or fullness in the throat 
that may make it feel like it is difficult to breathe or swallow.  Some patients will notice soreness and 
redness in the area where the drug is injected for up to several days after treatment.  There can be pain 
with OXAL infusion and the risk of skin irritation.  Other side effects include inflammation or infection 
of the bowel; rarely, patients have had confusion or other mental changes; a feeling of imbalance (as if 
you might fall down); lowering of the white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelet count which may 
put you at risk of infection, bleeding or bruising; you may develop a rash or an allergic reaction; fever 
may occur; brief change in your vision (blurring); change in your heart beat (rapid heart beat) while you 
are being given OXAL by vein, loss of hair; being very tired; changes in blood tests measuring body 
salts; and abnormal liver function.  OXAL, when combined with 5-Fluorouracil and leucovorin, may also 
cause a serious infection starting from the bowel if you have had bad diarrhea and a low blood count.  
This type of infection can lead to death. 
 
One case of anemia and kidney damage (called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [HUS]) has been reported 
with the use of OXAL. 
 
A few patients treated with oxaliplatin have developed a condition known as “Tumor Lysis Syndrome.”  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome is a complication that can occur when cancer cells are destroyed by treatment.  
The destruction of cells may damage the kidneys and change calcium levels in the body.  This 
complication may lead to the need for kidney dialysis usually on a temporary basis. 
 
More than 50,000 patients have been treated with OXAL.  In the patients treated with this drug, there 
have been 11 patients who got lung problems such as cough, shortness of breath, or trouble breathing.  
These events can be life-threatening.  This caused scar tissue in the lungs.  It is possible that OXAL 
brought about this problem in some or all of these cases.  You are asked to make your doctor aware of 
any new side effects related to breathing and your doctor has been asked to be alerted to such side 
effects.  We will stop OXAL if you get any of these problems. 
 
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU):  Given alone or together with leucovorin may cause soreness in the mouth, 
diarrhea that could lead to dehydration, skin rash, lowering of the blood counts which could lead to 
infection or bleeding, watery eyes, vein discoloration or irritation, and thinning of the hair.  Rarely, use 
of 5-FU is associated with unsteadiness of movement.  There is a theoretical possibility that the side 
effects of OXAL when used in combination with 5-FU could be worsened, especially those relating to 
the diarrhea and to lowering of the blood count. 

Appendix I 
Page 5 of 8  
Addendum 22 

 
Leucovorin (CF):  Is not known to produce side effects in the doses employed in this study, although this 
drug may increase side effects caused by 5-FU. 
 
Risks/Side Effects of Intravenous Injection:  Escape of the chemotherapy drug from the vein where the 
injection is given into may cause inflammation in the area of the injection.  
 
Risks/Side Effects Insertion of Port:  Risks associated with central venous catheters may occur.  These 
risks include infection, bleeding, and perforation of the lung (the latter, if the catheter is centrally 
inserted).  All care will be taken to minimize these side effects, but they are unpredictable in both nature 
and severity. 
 
This study may hurt an unborn or a breast-fed child.  There is not enough medical information to know 
what the risks might be to a breast-fed infant or to an unborn child of a man or woman who takes part in 
this study.  Men who are able to father a child and women who can become pregnant must use one of 
these birth control plans during this study:  condoms, diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, 
intrauterine device (IUD), surgical sterilization, under the skin implants, abstinence.  Another choice is 
for your sexual partner to use one of these birth control plans.  Breast-feeding mothers must stop breast-
feeding to take part in this study.  Women who can still become pregnant must have a pregnancy test 
before taking part in this study.  If you are a woman who can become pregnant, blood will be taken from 
a vein in your arm with a needle within 7 days before you enter the study.  You will be told if you are 
pregnant or not.  If you are pregnant, you will not be able to take part in the study. 
 
Are there benefits to taking part in this study? 
 
No benefit can be guaranteed by taking part in this study, and the chance of benefit from this 
investigational treatment cannot be accurately predicted.  Tumor shrinkage associated with treatment 
may make one feel better or live longer than might have been the case without treatment. 
 
What other choices do I have if I don’t take part in this study? 
 
A doctor will discuss these alternative programs in detail as they may relate to your decision to 
participate.  Possible alternatives include the use of 5-FU with or without CF and with or without 
CPT-11, other investigational studies, or no chemotherapy treatment. 
 
What are the costs of tests and procedures? 
 
The drugs 5-FU and CF are commercially available.  You and/or your health care plan will be 
responsible for all costs associated with this treatment.  
 
The Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis of the National Cancer Institute will provide you with 
the investigational drug OXAL.  Should OXAL become commercially available or approved for this 
indication during the course of the study, you may be asked to purchase subsequent doses of the 
medicine.

Certain tests and examinations need to be done regularly to safely plan the treatment, measure how 
effective the treatment is, and evaluate any side effects.  These tests include physical examinations, x-
rays, scans, and blood tests.  Costs for these tests and examinations will be billed to you and/or your 
health care plan.  The use of medications or other types of treatment to help control side effects could 
result in added costs to you and/or your health care plan.  Some health insurance plans may not cover 
these procedures.  You should check with your insurance company before enrollment to see  if 
insurance coverage is available under your plan. 
  
Any tests, examinations, or other procedures that are performed solely for research purposes will be 
discussed and will not be billed to you.  
 
What are my rights if I take part in this study?   
 
Taking part in this research study is your decision.  You do not have to take part in this study, but if you 
do, you can stop at any time.  Your medical care now or in the future will not be affected whether or not 
you take part in this study. 
 
The investigators may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if it is in your best interest, if 
you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is stopped.  You will be told of important new findings 
or any changes in the study or procedures that may happen. 
 
You do not give up any of your rights by taking part in this study. 
 
Who can answer my questions? 
 
You may talk to Dr. (                                ), telephone (___________________), at any time about any

A Randomized Phase III Trial of Combinations of Oxaliplatin (OXAL), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), and 
Irinotecan (CPT-11) as Initial Treatment of Patients With Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Colon 

  
Thank you for enrolling in study N9741.  Even though we can only identify you through your assigned 
study number, the progress and side effects experienced by every patient who signed up for this study are 
being closely monitored by me, as the author and leader of the study, by your physician, and by other 
clinical investigators. We do this as a matter of course in order to assure your safety as a study 
participant.   
 
Since March 2002, the study has been open only to Arms A (CPT-11 followed by leucovorin and 5-FU) 
and F (Oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and leucovorin).  Arm A has been considered to be the standard of care for 
treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer. 
 
The NCCTG Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), a group of clinical trials experts and cancer patients, 
has reviewed information about participants enrolled in this study.  In this review, a difference in the 
potential benefits between the treatments was identified. While the study leadership, investigators, 
statisticians, and NCI gather and evaluate information, the study leadership and the DMC have requested 
that accrual of new patients to all arms except ARM F be stopped. 
 
The Data Monitoring Committee found the following in its review:  First, the outcomes for the group of 
patients treated with Arm F appear to be better than those treated on Arm A.  In addition, fewer side 
effects were experienced by the group of patients treated on Arm F.  Thus, it appears that the study may 
turn out to demonstrate that Arm F will be the best overall arm.  However, it is important to recognize 
that each arm of the study had some patients who responded well.  Some of the patients on all of the arms 
received a benefit from their treatment.  
 
We take seriously our obligation to keep all patients informed of research developments, and we expect 
to have completed a reliable analysis about the precise benefit of Arm F within a short period of time. In 
the meantime, discuss this information with your study team and your physician to answer any questions 
you may have.  
 
Thank you for your assistance and for your important contribution to the future well being of colorectal 
cancer patients everywhere.

PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREVENTING

AND TREATING DIARRHEA                

Be aware of your bowel movements.  At the ﬁrst signs that stools are softer than usual, runny or watery, or if 
you have more bowel movements in a day than normal, begin taking loperamide.  If you do not start taking 
loperamide right away, severe diarrhea may occur.  This can last several days and require 
hospitalization.  Please follow these directions carefully.

• Take two caplets (4 mg) at the ﬁrst signs of any changes (see above).

• Continue taking one capsule (2 mg) every two hours until you have returned to your normal pattern of 
bowel movements for 12 hours.  Start taking loperamide again (same doses and frequency) if diarrhea
returns.

• During the night, you may take two capsules every four hours instead.

•

If you have diarrhea, stop taking any laxatives and avoid dairy products.

• Please call your doctor if you have any questions about taking loperamide, if your diarrhea is not under

control after three days, if you are feeling extremely weak, or if you think you are having any side effects.

• Be sure to drink plenty of ﬂuids each day (several glasses of water, fruit juice, soda, soup, etc.).  This will

help prevent dehydration (note:  ﬂuids do not cause diarrhea).

• Side effects of loperamide may include tiredness, drowsiness or dizziness.  If you experience these effects,

avoid driving motorized vehicles or operating machinery.

Administering Quality-of-Life Questionnaires:   

Instructions for Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) 

 
The instructions given below are intended to serve as a guide for administering the Symptom Distress 
Scale and Uniscale Patient Form.  In the event an individual other than a CRA must administer a QOL 
questionnaire, the instructions below should be followed in the same way as if the individual were 
fulfilling the role of the CRA. 
 
1. 

The QOL questionnaire must be completed by the patient alone, without coaching or suggestions 
as to the “correct” answer by health care personnel, relatives, or anyone else.  Patient instructions 
are located on the inside of the front cover. 

The CRA should give the questionnaire directly to the patient before he or she is seen by the 
physician at the clinic visits indicated in the protocol (at study entry and at each subsequent 
evaluation of treatment).  Generally, there is a brief period while the patient is waiting to see the 
physician.  This would be an excellent time to ask the patient to complete the questionnaire, 
since it only takes a few minutes. 

The CRA may provide clarification but should not rephrase questions, suggest answers, or 
discuss answers.  If any questions arise regarding administration of the questionnaire, the CRA 
can call the eligibility/treatment person whose phone number is listed on the protocol resource 
page at the front of the written protocol. 

The CRA should collect the questionnaire as soon as it is has been completed, check the answers 
to see that each question has been answered, and gently remind the patient to answer any 
questions that may have been inadvertently not answered.  If the patient states that he or she 
prefers not to answer some or any of the questions, the CRA should not encourage the patient to 
do so, but subsequently should provide an explanatory comment. 

Questionnaires should not be mailed to patients, except in very exceptional circumstances such 
as failure to give the questionnaire to the patient during a clinic visit.  If such a circumstance was 
to occur, the completed questionnaire should be accompanied by a note from the CRA explaining 
why the questionnaire was mailed to the patient. 

The patient should be encouraged to complete the questionnaire in the clinic, preferably before 
seeing the physician, and should not take the questionnaire home for return (in person or by mail) 
at a later time.  (Varying the environment in which the questionnaire is completed by allowing 
completion at times other than at the time of the clinic visit introduces unnecessary variables into 
the study.)  Should the patient insist on taking the questionnaire home, and failure to comply with 
the patient’s wishes is likely to result in the questionnaire not being completed at all, then the 
patient may take the questionnaire home with the instructions that it is to be completed the same 
day.  When the questionnaire is returned, the CRA should check the data on which the 
questionnaire was completed and attach a note to it stating why the patient took it away from the 
clinic before completion. 

The information provided by the patient in the completed questionnaire is confidential and 
should not be discussed with, or shown to, anyone who is not mentioned in the consent form 
signed by the patient.

With Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Colon and Rectum 

 
These instructions supplement the protocol for EPP participants.  The protocol is to be followed in areas 
not described in this appendix. 
 
 
1.0  EPP Randomization and Registration Procedures (Revised 2/01) 
  
I.  EPP institutions will register a patient on-line through the Clinical Trials Management Unit (CTMU). 
Questions pertaining to eligibility criteria should be directed to the CTMU, medical questions should be 
directed to the Study Chair. 

 

II.  A signed HHS 310 form documenting the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for this study 
must be on file at the CTMU before the EPP institution can enter a patient. IRB approval date must be 
less than one year prior to the date of registration.   
 
III.  All investigators must be registered with CTEP, DCTD by the annual submission of the FDA Form 
1572 and a current CV.  To obtain an NCI/CTEP investigator number, investigators should complete and 
submit (by USMail or Express Courier, faxes are not acceptable) an FDA Form 1572, with an original 
signature, and a current curriculum vitae to the CTMU at: 
 

The EMMES Corporation

6.0   EPP Adverse Event (AE) Reporting (Revised 2/01) 
 
A hyperlink to the CTEP home page that contains CTC version 2.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting is available on the EPP web-site. EPP investigators are responsible for reporting adverse events 
according to the guidelines provided below, including notification to their local IRB. All reporting should 
be conducted within the time frames below, and completed forms should be submitted to the CTMU as 
outlined below. Once received, the CTMU will forward the forms to NCCTG, who will forward them to 
the appropriate authorities. 

 

6.1   Explanation of terms used in adverse event reporting 
 
Adverse event (AE) - An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical 
treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or 
procedure.  
 
 

Appendix XII 
Page 4 of 6 
Addendum 22 

 

The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the investigational agent(s). 
The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent (s). 
The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent (s). 
The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent (s). 
The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent (s). 

To select the correct toxicity name for an adverse event, refer to the NCI’s Common Toxicity Criteria 
(CTC) Version 2.0. The NCI has an available Index to the CTC Version 2.0 that provides help for 
classifying and locating toxicities.  The CTC can be found on the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program 
(CTEP) homepage at http://ctep.info.nih.gov/CTC3/ctc.html.  If you need further assistance, please 
contact the CTMU. 
 
Grade - The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0 must be used to determine the grade 
(severity) of the adverse event. 
 
Attribution - Attribution is defined as the determination of whether an adverse event is related to a 
medical treatment or procedure.  Attribution categories are as follows: 
 
 
•  Unrelated 
•  Unlikely to be related 
 
•  Possibly related 
 
•  Probably related 
•  Definitely related 
 
 
Expectedness - an adverse event is unexpected (unknown) if the type of event (or its specificity or 
severity) is not listed in the drug package insert or the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR).  It is expected 
(known) if it has been reported previously by other physicians and is listed in the drug  
package insert or the PDR. 
 
Commercial Agent - a commercial agent is any drug included in the protocol therapy that is not supplied 
under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND).  In N9741, 5-FU and Leucovorin are the 
commercial agents. 
 
Investigational Agent - an investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational 
New Drug Application (IND).  In N9741, Oxaliplatin and CPT-11 are the investigational agents. 
 
Treatment arms which contain an Investigational agent should be reported according to Investigational 
guidelines. 
 
6.2  Procedures for reporting 
 
Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  Grade the severity of the 
event using the CTC v. 2.0.  Then, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (refer to 
Section 15.0 of the protocol, Drug Information) and if the adverse event is related to the protocol 
treatment or procedure.  With this information, determine whether an adverse event should be reported as 
an expedited report or as part of the routinely reported clinical data. All grades of all adverse events felt 
to be at least possibly treatment related, including those with separate reporting requirements, should be 
reported on the EPP Toxicity Form.  
 
Expedited adverse event reporting requires submission of a written report to the CTMU.  Telephone 
notification of NCI and CTMU may also be required.  Telephone and written reports are to be completed  
within the timeframes specified in the table below.  All expedited adverse event reports should also be 

Appendix XII 
Page 5 of 6 
Addendum 22 

submitted to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
 
Effective January 1, 2001, all ADR’s are to be reported via the AdEERS web-based system 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov/adeers).  If the system is unavailable, you may fax the reports to the CTMU  
(Attn: EPP Protocol Monitor 202-478-0163) using the Adverse Event Expedited Report templates posted 
on the EPP website.  
 
Deaths within 30 days of the patient’s last treatment, regardless of attribution to the study treatment or 
procedure, with the exception of signs or symptoms definitely related to the patient’s disease or disease 
progression requires an expedited report. 
 
Deaths are required to be reported via the EPP Death Form within 7 days of knowledge of the event. Any 
death more than 30 days after the patient’s last study treatment or procedure which is felt to be at least 
possibly treatment related must also be submitted as a Grade 5 AE, with a CTC type and attribution 
assigned.

Appendix XIII 

 

NCI/Sanofi-Synthelabo CRADA 

The agent, OXAL, used in this protocol is provided to the NCI under a Cooperative Research 
and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Sanofi-Synthelabo (hereinafter referred to as 
Collaborator) and the NCI Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.  Therefore, the 
following obligations/guidelines apply to the use of OXAL in this study: 
 
1. 

OXAL may not be used outside the scope of this protocol, nor can OXAL be transferred 
or licensed to any party not participating in the clinical study.  Collaborator data for 
OXAL are confidential and proprietary to the collaborator and should be maintained as 
such by the investigators. 

 
2. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
3. 

For a clinical protocol where there is an investigational agent used in combination with 
(an)other investigational agent(s), each the subject of different CTAs or CRADAs, the 
access to and use of data by each Collaborator shall be as follows (data pertaining to 
such combination use shall hereinafter be referred to as  
“Multi-Party Data”): 

a. 

b. 

c. 

NCI must provide all Collaborators with written notice regarding the existence 
and nature of any agreements governing their collaboration with NIH, the design 
of the proposed combination protocol, and the existence of any obligations that 
would tend to restrict NCI's participation in the proposed combination protocol. 

Each Collaborator shall agree to permit use of the Multi-Party Data from the 
clinical trial by any other Collaborator to the extent necessary to allow said other 
Collaborator to develop, obtain regulatory approval, or commercialize its own 
investigational agent. 

Any Collaborator having the right to use the Multi-Party Data from these trials 
must agree in writing prior to the commencement of the trials that it will use the 
Multi-Party Data solely for development, regulatory approval, and 
commercialization of its own investigational agent. 

The NCI encourages investigators to make data from clinical trials fully available to 
Collaborator(s) for review at the appropriate time (see # 5).  The NCI expects that 
clinical trial data developed under a CTA or CRADA will be made available exclusively 
to Collaborator(s), and not to other parties. 

Appendix XIII

Addendum 22 

When a Collaborator wishes to initiate a data request, the request should first be sent to 
the NCI, who will then notify the appropriate investigators (Group Chair for cooperative 
group studies, or PI for other studies) of Collaborator's wish to contact them. 

Any data provided to Collaborator(s) must be in accordance with the guidelines and 
policies of the responsible Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), if there is a DMC for 
this clinical trial. 

Any manuscripts reporting the results of this clinical trial should be provided to CTEP 
for immediate delivery to Collaborator(s) for advisory review and comment prior to

Appendix XVI, N9741 Patient and Physician Fact Sheet 

Below is a list of side effects that may happen in patients who are treated with the drugs oxaliplatin 
(OXAL), irinotecan (CPT-11), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (CF) as they are given in this study.  
Other side effects not known at this time may also happen.  The health care team should be notified of 
any side effects that occur and are more than mild side effects.  Please carefully read and follow the 
instructions in the warning message below. 
 

•  Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) 
•  Vomiting (throwing up) 
•  Diarrhea (frequent bowel movements)  
•  Abdominal cramping 
•  Dehydration 
•  Fever  
•  Low white blood cell count  (This can 
increase the risk of serious infection.) 

•  Low red blood cell count or anemia (This 

can make you feel dizzy, faint, or cause 
shortness of breath or chest pain.) 

•  Low platelet count (This can increase the 

risk of bruising and bleeding.)  

•  Shortness of breath 

 

•  Redness, swelling, or sores of the lips, 

gums, tongue, mouth, or throat 
•  Ulcers of the intestine with the 

possibility of intestinal bleeding and 
blood or black tarry material in the stool 

•  Tingling or an unusual feeling in the 

hands, feet, mouth, and throat, and 
tightness in the throat (This may be 
worse or more likely to happen with 
exposure to cold temperatures.) 

•  Imbalance, unsteadiness of movements, 

or feeling as if you might fall down 

•  Cough 
•  Lessened ability to get oxygen 
•  Temporary inactivity of muscles in the 

intestines 

•  Loss of appetite 
•   Weakness 
•  Sweating 
•  Flushing (redness in the face) 
•  Runny nose and watery eyes 
•  Hair loss 
•  Vision problems 
•  Allergic reactions 
•  Redness or other rash-like skin 

conditions 

•  Liver damage 
•  Kidney damage 
•  Skin sores or severe inflammation 

(redness) at the injection site 

•  Vein discoloration or irritation 

WARNING: 

 

Side effects (especially diarrhea and lowering of the white blood cell count) may be more serious when the drugs are 
given in combination.  If you develop a fever of 100.5 degrees or more at a time when the white blood cell count is low, 
you may need to be admitted to the hospital for antibiotic treatment until your count returns to a safe level.  Diarrhea 
that occurs at a time when the white cell count is very low can be especially dangerous.  It may lead to a life-threatening 
infection that requires hospitalization for intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotics.  You can become critically ill and some 
patients have died from this type of infection.  In order to lessen the chance of this type of infection: 
 
•  You must pay attention to your bowel movements.  If they become softer than usual or if you have any more bowel 

movements than what is normal for you, you must begin taking loperamide (Imodium®) as directed by your doctor.  
If your soft bowel movements or diarrhea do not stop within 36 hours, you must call your doctor. 

 
•  Mild dehydration can often be corrected by drinking such sports drinks as Gatorade, Powerade, etc.  If you develop 

diarrhea, consider this. 

 
•  Should you become weak, lightheaded, or feel faint, call your doctor at once.   
 
•  The use of laxatives and magnesium-containing antacids (Milk of Magnesia, Rolaids®, Mylanta®, Maalox®, etc.) 
should be avoided during the study because they can make the diarrhea worse.  Do not use either of these before 
asking your doctor. 

 
•  You should check your temperature on a regular basis and call your doctor at once if you develop a fever of  

100.5 degrees or more. 

 

Seek emergency medical care if any of the above symptoms occur.   
Contact your local doctor at:_____________________________.   

Please call if you have any questions.

April 5, 2000 
 
Dear Participant and Family: 
 
I am writing to inform you of new findings based upon analysis of data from two ongoing colorectal 
cancer clinical trials involving the drug, CPT-11.  This is important information we want to share with 
you. 
 
Also, you are receiving this letter because you are a participant or because your late family member was a 
participant in NCCTG N9741, A Randomized Phase III Trial of Two Different Regimens of CPT-11 Plus 
5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin, Two Different Regimens of Oxaliplatin (OXAL) Plus 5-Fluorouracil and 
Leucovorin and One Regimen of OXAL and CPT-11 Compared to 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin as 
Initial Treatment of Patients With Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Colon and Rectum. 
 
New data from two randomized trials testing the addition of CPT-11 to a standard regimen of  
5-Fluorouracil plus leucovorin has shown the following for the group of patients treated with CPT-11 and 
5-Fluorouracil plus leucovorin. 
 
1.  Improvement in the amount of time from the start of treatment to the time the disease gets worse.  
 
2.  Improvement in the amount of time from the diagnosis of advanced disease to the time of death. 
 
3.  Increase in the number of participants who achieve a response (shrinkage of tumor). 
 
This led to a decision by the Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) to recommend the approval 
of CPT-11 plus 5-FU and CF as a new standard of care for advanced colorectal cancer. 
 
In addition, representatives of the National Cancer Institute, the Food and Drug Administration, and 
committee chairs from all participating cooperative groups throughout the United States were asked for 
input and decided to reduce the number of treatment arms from six arms to three arms (delete arms B, D 
and E).  The rationale for these changes is as follows: 
 
1.  Arm B (CPT-11 plus 5-Fluorouracil and leucovorin).  Of the six arms previously being studied, 

preliminary information suggested that there were more serious side effects on this arm. 

 
2.  Arm D (5-Fluorouracil plus leucovorin).  This arm was the former standard therapy arm.  Also, of the 

six arms previously being studied, preliminary information suggested that there were more side 
effects on this arm. 

 
3.  Arm E (OXAL and 5-Fluorouracil/leucovorin).  Of the six arms previously being studied, 
preliminary information suggested that there were more serious side effects on this arm. 

 
4.  It was believed that simplification of the study would make it easier for study participants to 

understand and allow the trial to reach an answer more quickly. 

Appendix XVII

Addendum 22 

 
In March of 2000, new information became available that led to investigators involved in this study and 
in consultation with the National Cancer Institute decide to change the trial to the current three-arm 
study.  First, information from two studies indicated that Arm A of this study improved the tumor 
shrinkage rate, average time to tumor worsening, and the average time that patients with advanced 
colorectal cancer survived over patients enrolled in the program that was Arm D in this study.  Because 
of this, it was felt to be impossible to continue to enroll patients into Arm D and the entire study design 
was looked at again.  At that same time, several patients had severe side effects from the treatments 
prescribed in Arm B and Arm E of the study, including some deadly side effects.  These severe side 
effects usually occurred at the time of the first set of treatments. 
 
Clinical trials remain an important tool for finding ways to prevent cancer and improve health for all 
Americans.  We greatly appreciate each person’s participation in this important cancer trial.   
We remain confident that this trial ultimately will provide valuable information to permit progress in the 
treatment of colorectal cancer.  A more complete analysis of the study data will be done at a later time, 
and we expect to publish these findings in the years ahead.    
 
Sincerely,

Dear ___________________:

You are currently participating in a clinical trial that utilizes oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and
irinotecan for advanced adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum.

Based on information learned on this study, the researchers have made the decision that it would
be beneficial to extend the collection of survival information beyond the 3 years you originally
consented to doing.  Therefore, starting 3 years after study entry, you will be contacted once a
year.

By signing this letter, you are giving the researchers permission to contact you for this extended
period of time.

We want to thank you for your participation in this important clinical trial.

Sincerely,

Henry C. Pitot, M.D.
