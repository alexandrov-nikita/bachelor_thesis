Protocol Synopsis 

A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study 
to Evaluate AMG 162 in the Treatment of Bone Loss in 
Subjects Undergoing Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy For 
Non-metastatic Breast Cancer 
3 
Treatment of bone loss in patients undergoing 
aromatase inhibitor therapy for non-metastatic breast 
cancer (BC). 
To determine whether AMG 162 compared with placebo 
will preserve lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) 
during aromatase inhibitor therapy in subjects with non-
metastatic BC after 12 months. 
The secondary objectives are to assess the effect of 
AMG 162 compared with placebo on the following: 
(cid:120)  BMD of the total hip and femoral neck 
(cid:120)  The safety and pharmacokinetics of AMG 162 in 

patients with non-metastatic BC undergoing 
aromatase inhibitor therapy 

The study will also explore the effect of AMG 162 on 
vertebral and non-vertebral fracture incidence and 
overall survival. 
This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study in subjects with non-metastatic 
BC undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy.  
Approximately 208 subjects will be randomized to 
receive either AMG 162 or placebo using an allocation 
ratio of 1:1. The randomization schedule will be stratified 
based on duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy at the 
time of study entry ((cid:100) 6 months vs > 6 months). 
All subjects will receive daily supplemental calcium plus 
vitamin D, and will participate in the study for 24 months.  
All subjects who were randomized to the original 24-
month study who received at least one dose of 
investigational product and who completed the 24-
month treatment phase will be asked to participate in 
the safety follow up phase.  Safety data will be 
collected by clinic visit or telephone contact 
approximately every 6 months for up to 2 years after 
the 24-month treatment period. 
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will 
monitor subject safety on an ongoing basis throughout 
the trial. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in 
the lumbar spine BMD from baseline to Month 12.

Statistical Considerations  This study is designed to evaluate the benefit of AMG 

162 relative to placebo (calcium and vitamin D alone) to 
increase BMD during the 12-month treatment period.   
The primary null hypothesis is that there is no difference 
in percent of change of BMD for lumbar spine between 
AMG 162 and placebo after 12 months of randomized 
treatment. 
The sample size of 104 subjects per treatment arm will 
provide at least 90% power to detect 2% difference

between AMG 162 dose and placebo in the percent of 
change of BMD for lumbar spine at Month 12. 
The analysis of the percent change from baseline in 
lumbar spine BMD will employ a likelihood-based 
repeated measures model (Longford, 1993) that includes 
treatment (AMG 162 or placebo), duration of aromatase 
inhibitor therapy ((cid:100)6 months vs. > 6 months), baseline 
BMD value, machine type, baseline BMD value by 
machine type interaction, visit and visit by treatment 
interaction as fixed effects. 
Safety will be characterized by evaluating incidence and 
severity of adverse events, and toxicity grade shift in lab 
values. The number and percentage of subjects who 
develop anti-AMG 162 antibodies will be tabulated by 
study visit.

1.1 

OBJECTIVES   

Primary  

 

Page 15 of 91 

The primary objective of the study is to determine whether AMG 162, compared to 
placebo, will preserve lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) during aromatase 
inhibitor therapy in subjects with non-metastatic BC after 12 months.   

1.2 

Secondary  

The secondary objectives are to assess the effect of AMG 162 compared to placebo on 
additional parameters of osteoclast suppression and overall bone health.  Individual 
objectives are as follows:   

(cid:120)  BMD of the total hip and femoral neck  
(cid:120)  Safety and pharmacokinetics of AMG 162 administration up to 24 months in subjects 

with non-metastatic breast cancer (BC). The safety profile of AMG 162 includes 
adverse events, laboratory assessments, vital signs, and anti-AMG 162 antibody 
response.  Safety will be followed for up to 2 years after the end of the 24-
month treatment phase (as described in Section 7.13). 

1.3 

Exploratory 

Exploratory objectives are to evaluate the following parameters during the 24-month 
administration with AMG 162. 

(cid:120)  BMD of the 1/3 distal radius (left forearm) and total body;  
(cid:120)  Bone resorption and formation as measured by serum C-Telopeptide (CTX) and 

procollagen Type I N-terminal peptide (PINP). 

(cid:120)  The effect of AMG 162 compared with placebo on vertebral and non-vertebral 

fracture incidence

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

Disease  

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, with an incidence rate of over 
210,000 cases per year and prevalence rate in excess of 2 million in the US alone 
(Jemal et al, 2003).  Endocrine therapy is recommended for nearly all women with 
estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR). In postmenopausal women with 
breast cancer, the concentration of estradiol in breast-carcinoma tissue is about 10 times

the concentration in plasma, probably in part because of the presence of intratumoral 
aromatase (Thijssen and Blankenstein, 1989). Aromatase inhibitors lower the estrogen 
level in the tumor reducing circulating estrogen from 1% to 10% of pretreatment levels in 
patients with ER+ or ER-/PR+ (Lake and Hudis, 2002).  Aromatase inhibitors have been 
shown to be superior to the available hormonal therapy in multiple efficacy endpoints, 
including objective response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP), and possibly 
survival, in both first and second line settings in postmenopausal women with advanced 
hormone receptor positive breast tumors (Dombernowsky et al, 1998; Nabholtz et al, 
2000; Mouridsen et al, 2001). The benefit of aromatase inhibitors has been also shown 
in adjuvant setting in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors, 
either as the first-line therapy or after completing 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with 
tamoxifen (Goss et al, 2003). 

Because of the endocrine changes induced by cancer treatment (chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, and hormone ablation), women with breast cancer are at increased risk of 
developing osteoporosis. Further confounding this issue is the increasing use of 
aromatase inhibitors which unlike selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), 
deplete estrogen in the body.  There are no guidelines on how to manage accelerated 
bone loss caused by cancer therapy in women with breast cancer. Medical 
recommendations include lifestyle modification including smoking cessation and regular 
exercise, and supplemental dietary calcium and vitamin D.  Studies have shown 
risedronate (30 mg/day for 2 weeks then 10 weeks off) and clodronate at 1600 mg daily 
(not available in the US) for two years can reduce bone loss due to a chemotherapy-
induced menopause (Saarto et al, 1997). However, both risedronate and clodronate are 
not well and widely tolerated because of renal toxicity.  To date, no trials have been 
performed using anti-osteolytic agents or bone anabolic agents for the treatment of 
accelerated bone loss that occurs during or after treatment with aromatase inhibitors.

2.2 

AMG 162 Background 

 

Page 17 of 91 

AMG 162 is a fully human monoclonal antibody to Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-
(cid:78)B Ligand (RANKL; IgG2), with high affinity (Kd 3 X 10-12) for RANKL.  It blocks binding 
of RANKL to RANK and prevents terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts.  It 
also binds specifically to primate RANKL and does not bind to Tumor Necrosis Factor 
(TNF)(cid:68), TNF(cid:69), TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), or CD40L.   

RANKL is a critical factor in the terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts 
(Lacey et al, 1998; Yasuda et al, 1998; Burgess et al, 1999).  Genetic experiments 
demonstrated that mice with a disrupted RANKL gene have increased bone density and 
absence of osteoclasts (Kong et al, 1999).  Disorders of RANKL signaling have been 
implicated in many bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption, such as 
osteoporosis (Bucay et al,1998; Kostenuik et al, 2001; Bekker et al, 2001). Refer to the 
Investigators Brochure for more information. 

2.2.1 

Preclinical Studies 

AMG 162 binds and neutralizes the activity of human and cynomolgus RANKL.  This 
neutralizing activity is shared by both native Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and by engineered 
forms of OPG, including human OPG-Fc.  Both AMG 162 and huOPG-Fc also inhibit the 
hypercalcemic effect of soluble human RANKL in normal mice.  In healthy cynomolgus 
monkeys, AMG 162 produced an acute and profound reduction in bone resorption as 
assessed by levels of the surrogate marker serum N-telopeptide (N-Tx).  However, AMG 
162 has no pharmacologic effects in mice or rats because it does not cross-react with 
rodent RANK Ligand. 

Because of the lack of cross-reactivity of the molecule with rodent and murine RANKL, 
AMG 162 has not been evaluated in many of the validated models of human disease.  
However, the pharmacologic effects of RANKL antagonists in rodent disease models 
validate the potential usefulness of AMG 162 in human diseases.  In a model of 
postmenopausal osteoporosis, treatment of ovariectomized rats with rat RANKL (OPG 
linked to polyethylene glycol) caused an increase in bone mineral density (BMD). 

2.2.1.1  Pharmacokinetic Studies   
The pharmacokinetics of AMG 162 was examined in rats and both the pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics were examined in cynomolgus monkeys. The pharmacokinetic 
properties of AMG 162 appear to be dramatically affected by cross-reactivity to RANKL.

In cynomolgus monkeys, AMG 162 had a prolonged mean residence time (MRT), and 
low EC50 for sNTX such that pharmacologically active serum concentrations were 
maintained for 35-days for SC dose of 1 mg/kg. Clearance was non-linear with dose, 
and volume of distribution similar to plasma volume. AMG 162 produced a rapid (within 4 
hours) and profound (up to 72% inhibition from baseline) reduction in bone resorption 
that lasted up to 35 days following a single dose of 1 mg/kg, as assessed by levels of 
NTX. Upon multiple dosing anti-AMG 162 binding antibodies were detected in over 50% 
of cynomolgus monkeys. The incidence of anti-AMG 162 antibodies decreased as dose 
increased. For long-term treatment in cynomolgus monkeys a dose of 50 mg/kg was 
shown maintain pharmacologically effective serum levels in the majority of animals for 
up to 12 months.

2.2.1.2  Toxicology Studies  

Preclinical studies evaluating the safety of AMG 162 included tissue cross-reactivity, 
assessment of acute toxicity on the cardiovascular and respiratory system, and 
repeated-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  AMG 162 did not cross react 
with unexpected tissues in a standard panel of human tissues.  Immunoreactivity was 
observed in monkey and human lymph node, a tissue known to express high levels of 
RANKL (Lacey et al, 1998).  Hemodynamics, electrical activity of the heart 
(electrocardiograms), and respiratory rate were not affected by a 30 mg/kg single dose 
of AMG 162.  The initial repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that 
10 mg/kg administered weekly for 4 weeks was well tolerated.  AMG 162 has been 
administered to monkeys monthly for 1 year at doses of 1, 10 and 50 mg/kg.  With the 
exception of the 2 unexpected deaths in the high dose male group, no definitive 
toxicologically significant effects were observed following 12 months of SC dosing.  The 
2 unexpected deaths were not considered to be attributed to AMG 162 based on the 
difference in timing of the deaths, the non-specific nature of the lesions, and similarity to 
lesions observed in control animals.  Differences from control were noted for various 
clinical pathology but were highly variable within treated and control groups and were not 
attributed to AMG 162 treatment.  Antibodies to AMG 162 were observed in animals at 
all doses.  Antibody positive animals had decreased drug levels and decreased effect on 
bone markers and BMD compared with antibody-negative animals.  The no-observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) following monthly subcutaneous treatment of AMG 162 for 
12 months is considered to be 50 mg/kg.  This dose results in systemic exposure that is

50- fold greater compared to exposure from the current high dose in osteoporosis trials 
(210 mg 6-monthly). 

Additional information may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 

2.2.2 

Safety Profile  

As of 24 March 2006, over 11,400 subjects have enrolled into clinical studies and 
have received at least 1 dose of investigational product (AMG 162, matching 
placebo, or active control).  Over 5,000 subjects have received AMG 162.  Single 
doses up to 3 mg/kg SC or IV (weight-based) and 210 mg SC (fixed dose) have 
been studied.

AMG 162 has been generally well tolerated in the clinical studies conducted to 
date.  No unexpected adverse events of clinical concern have been observed.
Adverse events that have been considered by an investigator to be related to 
AMG 162 treatment have generally been diverse and mild to moderate in severity. 

Safety data available from five phase 1 studies that have been completed and a 
phase 2 study that has completed 24-months of treatment in which data is 
available have demonstrated the tolerability of AMG 162.  The incidence of 
adverse events, including serious adverse events, was similar between subjects 
who received AMG 162 and those who received the active comparator or placebo 
treatment.  Evaluation of vital signs and ECGs indicated no notable changes in 
AMG 162-treated subjects compared with control-treated subjects. No clinically 
significant trends indicative of an AMG 162 treatment effect were noted in clinical 
laboratory measurements.  Expected changes in bone turnover markers and 
serum albumin-adjusted calcium associated with the pharmacologic action of 
AMG 162 were observed.  Transient hypocalcemia has been observed in some 
subjects participating in clinical studies with AMG 162.  In most cases, the 
incidences of hypocalcemia were not associated with any clinical symptoms.

The detection of binding antibodies to AMG 162 in subjects has been uncommon. 
However when detected, these antibodies were of a transient nature and did not 
neutralize the biological activity of AMG 162 when tested in a bioassay.  No 
evidence of an effect on pharmacokinetics or bone turnover marker levels was 
observed in the subjects who developed binding antibodies. 

Interim results from a phase 2 study in postmenopausal women showed that the 
effect of AMG 162 on bone resorption appears to be fully reversible.  
Discontinuing AMG 162 may lead to reversal of the gains made in bone density.  
To ensure these losses in bone density are not excessive, patients who 
discontinue AMG 162 should be followed carefully.  Alternative approaches to 
maintaining prior gains need to be discussed with the patient. 

Additional information is in the Investigator Brochure. 

2.2.3 

Clinical Efficacy  

Based on data from study 20010124, a single SC or IV dose of AMG 162 was effective 
in reducing markers of bone turnover (eg, urine NTX /creatinine) in a dose-dependent 
manner.  The effect was observed as early as 12 hours following dosing.  The maximum 
mean decrease in urine NTX/creatinine was approximately 80% and the duration of 
effect was at least 6 months at higher doses (1 and 3 mg/kg AMG 162) in healthy 
postmenopausal women.

In a Phase 2 study, the treatment effect of AMG 162 was evident as early as 1 month 
after dosing based on the lumbar spine and total hip BMD changes.  At the lumbar 
spine, a mean percent change from baseline of 1.0% was observed in the placebo group 
at 6 months compared with 3.8% to 6.0% in the AMG 162 groups and 5.0% in the 
alendronate group.  A positive effect was observed at the femoral neck (0.5% in the 
placebo group, 1.9% to 3.2% in the AMG 162 groups, and 2.3% in the alendronate 
group) and the total hip (0.2% in the placebo group at 6 months compared with 2.0% to 
3.3% in the AMG 162 groups and 2.0% in the alendronate group).  No detrimental effect 
on BMD at a cortical bone site (distal 1/3 radius) was observed. 

In subjects receiving AMG 162, a rapid and dose-dependent decrease was observed in 
the levels of the bone resorption markers, evident at day 4, the earliest post baseline 
time point.  The maximum mean decrease in serum CTX was 88% with AMG 162

(compared with 70% with alendronate); the duration of the decrease reflected by these 
markers indicated a sustained effect for 6 months in the 100- and 210-mg AMG 162 6-
monthly dose groups.  The decrease was partially reversible in subjects in the 14- and 
60-mg 6-monthly groups, but the 60-mg dose was clearly more effective than the 14-mg 
dose. 

The decrease in bone resorption markers occurred faster with AMG 162 than with 
alendronate, as indicated by a significantly greater reduction in serum CTX with all 
doses of AMG 162 at the day 4 through month 5 time points.  A delayed decrease 
(approximately 1 month) in the levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was 
observed with AMG 162 treatment, confirming that AMG 162 is primarily a bone 
antiresorptive agent and that bone resorption and bone formation remain coupled with 
AMG 162 treatment. 

2.3 

Rationale  

Bone loss after medically induced hormone ablation is of growing concern in women with 
breast cancer.  There is increasing awareness of the significant disease free survival 
benefit of aromatase inhibitors in BC women with ER+ or ER-/PR+.  Because aromatase 
inhibitors reduce estradiol levels significantly, it suggested a rapid bone loss due to low 
estrogen level.  Since breast cancer patients generally have better survival outcome, 
and with this rapid bone loss, these patients are at increased risk of developing 
osteoporosis.  The risk of fracture at the hip increases 2.6-fold for every standard 
deviation decline in hip BMD.  Patients with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors 
represent a growing population who experience rapid and devastating bone loss.  The 
increased risk for fracture results in significant morbidity and mortality.

Major advances that highlight the use of aromatase inhibitors have changed the 
standard of care in women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer.  In premenopausal 
women, the ovary is the main source of estrogen.  In the postmenopausal women, 
peripheral estrogen synthesis in the skin, muscle, and adipose tissue becomes the 
primary source of circulating and local estrogen.  Estrogen stimulates the osteoblast to 
produce OPG and inhibits the production of RANKL.  In the absence of estrogen, the 
reduced levels of OPG result in increased bone resorption due to the unopposed actions 
of RANKL.  AMG 162 neutralizes RANKL, resulting in the inhibition of bone resorption.  
Aromatase inhibitors eliminate the production of estrogen, and are more selective and 
have improved survival rates in women with breast cancer (Goss et al, 2003).  It has

been recognized that bone loss occurs rapidly in these women.  In women undergoing 
chemotherapy for breast cancer who become postmenopausal, bone loss rates are as 
high as 4% at 6 months with an additional 3.7% loss in the second 6 months (Shapiro et 
al, 2001).  In one study, after less than 5 years of follow-up, an increase in fractures was 
observed in women treated with the aromatase inhibitor, anastrazole, compared to those 
treated with tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (Ramaswamy and 
Shapiro, 2003).  The medical burden of fracture incidence includes excessive care costs.  
Using a retrospective database, Zhou et al estimated the direct costs for bone fractures 
in women older than 65 years of age with early-stage breast cancer.  The direct costs for 
bone fracture were estimated to be $45,570 and 57% of the cost was from treating the 
fracture; the remaining costs were from excess long-term care costs and other treatment 
costs (Zhou et al, 2004). 

Biochemical markers of bone turnover are a part of predictors of the risk of fractures as 
they represent higher levels of bone loss.  The relationship between early decreases in 
bone turnover markers (BTM) and the effect of therapy on reduction of risk of fractures is 
less certain than using BMD measurements alone.  This study will explore the 
relationship between changes in BTM and changes in BMD as well as fracture risk.  
Bone resorption markers serum carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) and 
serum type I procollagen N-terminal propeptide (PINP) are selected to monitor the bone 
turnover rate.  Based on a previous study, the MORE study, there was a statistically 
significant change in PINP levels from baseline and may be predictive of the risk 
reduction in fracture seen with raloxifene therapy.  In addition, changes in PINP levels 
significantly predicted changes in BMD with clodronate therapy (Reginster et al, 2004; 
Cummings et al, 2002; Saarto et al, 1998).

To date, there are no approved or well-tested treatments to prevent bone loss in this at-
risk population.  Bisphosphonates and raloxifene (SERM) are not approved for treatment 
of these patients but are currently used as off-label treatment to prevent bone loss and 
treat osteoporosis in cancer patients. Studies have shown risedronate 30 mg/day for 2 
weeks then 10 weeks off and clodronate at 1600 mg daily (both are not available in the 
US) for two years can reduce bone loss induced by a chemotherapy-induced 
menopause (Saarto et al, 1997).  To date, no trials have been published using 
bisphosphonates for the treatment of bone loss that occurs during or after treatment with 
aromatase inhibitors. There are no regulatory guidelines for registration of anti-
osteoporotic agents in the treatment of medically induced bone loss.  There is a large

unmet need in this patient population; therefore, it is important to identify effective 
treatment to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis in patients who are undergoing 
adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment. 

Because of its profile as a fast-acting, potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption, 
AMG 162 may be an effective and convenient therapy for osteoporosis associated with 
sex hormone ablative therapy. 

Placebo-Controlled Trials 

In spite of the fact that there are no currently approved therapies for the treatment of 
bone loss associated with hormone ablative therapy, questions are often raised about 
the placebo-control group of subjects.  In this trial, “placebo-control” is actually provided 
in the form of adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D.  In a meta-analysis of 
15 trials in postmenopausal women (Shea et al, 2002), randomized to calcium 
supplementation or usual calcium intake in the diet, calcium alone reduced bone loss in 
the lumbar spine, the hip and total body.  The relative risk of vertebral and nonvertebral 
fractures was reduced.  In a 3-year community intervention study in elderly individuals, 
there was a 16% reduction in fracture incidence rate (RR 0.84) among male and female 
residents offered a calcium and vitamin D supplementation program (Larsen et al, 2004).  
In elderly U.S. subjects with a mean age of 71 years, daily treatment with 500 mg of 
calcium and 700 IU of vitamin D significantly reduced the total number of nonvertebral 
fractures (Dawson-Hughes et al, 1997).  Currently, supplemental calcium and vitamin D 
is the standard of care in osteoporotic patients, yet few patients receive appropriate 
supplementation.

In addition, although therapies exist to reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis, 
some issues remain unsettled.  Not all therapies are suitable for all patients and 
therapies vary in their effectiveness for all types of fracture.  Additional data are needed 
to assess onset of action, efficacy in elderly, vulnerable populations, efficacy in non-
Caucasians, efficacy at the hip and extraskeletal effects are some of the unanswered 
questions about various agents.   

Early Assessments 

AMG 162 has a rapid onset of action; therefore we anticipate, based on the phase II 
clinical trial that significant changes in BMD will be obtained as early as one month.

Current guidelines (National Osteoporosis Foundation, The Endocrine Society, American 
College of Rheumatology, American College of Clinical Endocrinologists, American 
College of Physicians) suggest that measurement of BMD should be no more often than 
yearly due to the instrument precision and the relatively slow action of anti-resorptive 
agents.   This has been a source of frustration to clinicians and patients who would 
prefer to be able to assess efficacy at a much earlier time point.  In an analogy with 
measurement of blood pressure and compliance with anti-hypertensive medication, 
previous studies have indicated that the measurement of BMD enhances the compliance 
with therapy for osteoporosis.  Thus, feedback to the patient early in the course of 
treatment can enhance outcomes overall.   

Clinical practice is changing the paradigm of measuring BMD at 12 months.  Several 
scientific issues have been clarified about bone biology that makes earlier 
measurements of BMD feasible and informative.  It has been recognized that bone loss 
in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is rapid, and current recommendations are to 
measure BMD at initiation of glucocorticoid treatment and at 6 months (American 
College of Rheumatology).  Secondly, with the approval of anabolic agents, Teriparatide 
treatment results in rapid changes in BMD such that many clinicians measure BMD at 
earlier time points to determine efficacy and limit treatment time. AMG 162 has a rapid 
onset of action resulting in a rapid change in BMD in the Phase II clinical trial.  Due to 
this rapid onset of action, significant differences in BMD can be noted as early as 1 
month.

Most registration trials for osteoporosis agents assessed BMD at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 
months.  In this study, subjects will have BMD assessments at Months 1 and 3 in 
addition to Months 6, 12, and 24. This will allow rapid determination of efficacy.  We 
anticipate that early BMD measurements will replace bone biochemical markers as an 
assessment of efficacy in the future. 

BMD T-score Criteria 

There is a large unmet medical need to prevent and treat bone loss induced by 
aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer patients.  In this population, little is known about 
bone loss associated with treatment of breast cancer, and there are no currently FDA-
approved therapies available.

Osteopenic women are clearly at risk for fracture, and with the addition of an aromatase 
inhibitor, will experience additional rapid and profound bone loss. The Study of 
Osteoporotic Fractures determined that many women fracture that have T-scores that 
are not in the osteoporotic range.  Within the first 5 years, 54% of hip fractures and 74% 
of non-vertebral fractures occurred in women who had a T-score > -2.5.   

2.4 

Clinical Hypothesis 

The primary clinical hypothesis is that AMG 162 compared with placebo will treat bone 
loss in women with non-metastatic BC during aromatase inhibitor therapy. AMG 162 will 
preserve BMD at the lumbar spine measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). 

The clinical safety hypothesis is that AMG 162 administration will be safe and well 
tolerated, and will not adversely impact the clinical outcome of women with non-
metastatic BC, measured by safety and overall survival.

EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 

Study Design 

This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects 
undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy for non-metastatic BC.  Approximately 208 
subjects will be enrolled into the study. 

Upon meeting all eligibility criteria and completing all screening assessments, subjects 
will be randomized 1:1 to one of 2 treatment arms (n=104/arm):   

(cid:120)  60 mg AMG 162 SC every 6 months 

(cid:120)  Placebo every 6 months 
The randomization schedule will be stratified based on duration of aromatase inhibitor 
therapy (0-6 months vs. >6 months).  All subjects will undergo screening and will be 
evaluated for study eligibility after a signed informed consent has been obtained.  All 
screening procedures should be completed within 28 days before the day of 
randomization. The first dose of investigational product is administered within 72 hours 
of randomization.  After the initial dose of investigational product is administered, 
subjects will be followed for 24 months.  Safety data will be collected by clinic visit or 
telephone contact approximately every 6 months for up to 2 years after the 24-
month treatment phase (clinic visits preferred).

During the treatment phase, all subjects will receive the same volume of study 
medication (AMG 162 or placebo) every 6 months and will receive daily supplemental 
calcium carbonate (1g) and a multivitamin containing at least 400 IU vitamin D.  

This study will assess treatment effect of AMG 162 in non-metastatic BC subjects as 
compared with placebo by measuring BMD at baseline, Months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24.  The 
planned study treatment duration is 2 years. There will be a final inferential analysis 
after all subjects have had opportunity to complete the Month 24 study visit.  In addition, 
data from the safety follow up phase will be summarized as well.   

The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the protocol 
synopsis section. 

The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.2.

Number of Centers 

This study will be conducted in approximately 40 centers throughout the United States 
and Canada. Sites that do not enroll subjects within 2 months of site initiation may have 
their contract terminated.

3.3 

Number of Subjects 

Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  Approximately 
208 subjects will be enrolled into the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of

On average, approximately 10 subjects will enroll at each investigative site.  Subjects not 
completing the study will not be replaced. 

A dropout rate of 20% per year is estimated in this study.  The rationale for the number 
of subjects required is outlined in Section 10.3.  

All subjects who complete the 24-month treatment phase will be asked to 
participate in the safety follow-up phase.  This may include subjects who ended IP 
early but remained on study for observation only through the Month 24 visit.

SUBJECT ENROLLMENT 

 

Page 30 of 91 

Before subjects may be entered into the study, Amgen requires a copy of the site’s 
written Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) approval of 
the protocol, informed consent form, and all other subject information and/or recruitment 
material, if applicable (see Section 12.3).  All subjects or legally acceptable 
representatives must personally sign and date the consent form before enrollment.   

Enrollment date is defined as the date the subject is randomized. 

5.1 

Subject Identification Number Assignment 

All subjects who enter into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the informed consent) will be assigned a 9-digit subject 
identification number by an interactive voice response system (IVRS) after they sign the 
IEC/IRB approved informed consent form and before the first study related procedure is 
performed.   

Site personnel must call the IVRS vendor to obtain a subject identification number.  
Screening subject identification numbers will be assigned in sequential order beginning 
with 135XXX001, with “XXX” = site number.  This number will be used to identify the 
subject throughout the screening period, treatment phase and safety follow up phase 
and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  The subject 
identification number must remain constant throughout the entire trial; it must not be 
changed at the time of rescreening, enrollment, or randomization.  This number will not 
be the same as the randomization number assigned for the study.

Randomization  

The randomization schedule will use randomly permuted blocks, and will be stratified by 
the duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy  (0-6 months or > 6 months) Randomization 
to placebo or the AMG 162 group will be based on a double-blind randomization 
schedule prepared by Amgen before the start of the study.  Subjects will be randomized 
using a 1:1 allocation to one of 2 treatment groups as outlined in Table 1, and must be 
randomized within 72 hours prior to scheduled Study Day 1 (day of first dose).   A 
subject will be considered randomized once a randomization number is assigned.   A 
subject may only be randomized once, and each randomization number may only be 
assigned to one subject.

TREATMENT PROCEDURES 

Dose Selection Justification 

The Phase 2 study (20010223) included both osteoporotic (lumbar spine BMD t-score < 
-2.5) and osteopenic (lumbar spine BMD t-score (cid:3)< -1.8 but (cid:116) -2.5) subjects.  AMG 162 
was effective in both groups and the dose response relationship was similar in both 
groups.  Therefore, data from this study were used in dose selection.   

Both 6-monthly and 3-monthly dosing of AMG 162 appeared to be effective in the phase 
2 study.  Due to greater convenience and potentially greater compliance, a 6-monthly 
schedule was selected for the current study. 

Evaluation of the BMD data at all anatomic sites, as well as serum CTX and urine 
NTX/creatinine, indicated that the 60 mg 6-monthly AMG 162 dose provided a response 
that was closest to the plateau phase of the dose response curve.  A 14 mg 6-monthly 
dose was effective in increasing BMD and decreasing bone turnover marker levels, but 
was suboptimal compared to the 60-mg 6-monthly dose of AMG 162.

o
r

A

Based on the safety profile in this and previous studies, no dose-limiting toxicities have 
been observed. 

The pharmacokinetic profiles showed that 60 mg 6-monthly provides adequate AMG 162 
levels for most subjects over the 6-month period.  The mean AMG 162 level at the end 
of the 6-month period was approximately 100 ng/mL, which is adequate to ensure a 
biologic response.  The ED50 for bone turnover response is estimated to be 5 ng/mL.  
The serum concentration for the 14-mg 6-monthly group was below the quantifiable limit 
at month 6 in all subjects indicating inadequate AMG 162 coverage for the 6-monthly 
period.  Following 2 or 3 doses of AMG 162, there did not appear to be significant drug 
accumulation or change in the clearance profile of AMG 162.

AMG 162 doses of (cid:116) 60 mg 6-monthly appeared to be at least as effective as 
alendronate 70 mg weekly based on BMD and bone turnover marker responses. 

In conclusion, an AMG 162 dose of 60 mg administered once every 6 months appears to 
be optimal based on the BMD, bone turnover, safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles.

Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 60 mg of AMG 162 or placebo every 6 
months. All subjects will receive investigational product through Month 18. 
Investigational product will not be administered during the safety follow up phase. 
Cohort assignment is outlined above in Table 1.

AMG 162/placebo will be administered as a SC injection, which must be administered by 
a health care professional at the scheduled dosing visit after all other study visit 
procedures have been completed.

Each site will be supplied with 2 types of blinded study boxes, which will contain either a 
vial of placebo or a vial of 60 mg AMG 162 for the preparation of a 1.0 mL SC injection.   
Blinded study boxes will not be pre-assigned to specific subjects.  Once a subject is 
ready for her initial or on-study scheduled dose, the site personnel will call the IVRS 
vendor to obtain a box number assignment.  Please refer to specific instructions 
provided by the IVRS vendor for additional information.  

There have been no reports of overdose with this product.  The highest dose tested in 
clinical trials is 210 mg SC administered every 6 months.  It is possible that an overdose 
may result in hypocalcemia.  Hypocalcemia, if severe, should be managed by oral or 
parenteral calcium replacement, as clinically indicated. 

If a subject misses a scheduled SC injection, then they should return to the clinic as 
soon as possible for investigational product administration (preferably no later than 45 
days after their scheduled dose).  If more than 45 days has elapsed since the missed 
dose, please contact the study manager for specific instructions. 

A separate pharmacy guide (Appendix F) provides the details of preparing and 
administering investigational product.  A schema in the protocol synopsis describes the 
dosing schedule.

STUDY PROCEDURES 

Study tests and procedures will be performed only after a signed written informed 
consent is obtained.  During the study, every effort should be made to keep subjects on 
the study schedule of procedures.  Tests and procedures will be performed as per the 
schedule provided in Appendix A. 

All visits should be scheduled in the morning, as subjects must fast approximately 8 
hours before serum sample collection (fasting is not required for the screening visit).  
Investigational product administration should occur after all study visit procedures have 
been completed. Specific details of all tests and procedures are outlined below. 

Study visit definitions:

7.5.1  Biomarker Development 

In addition to testing the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug AMG 162 in 
this study, Amgen may attempt to develop blood test(s) designed to identify patients 

Amgen Thousand Oaks 

Confidential 

 

Product:  AMG 162

Page 37 of 91 

most likely to benefit from AMG 162.  Such biomarker development is pursued by use of 
advanced biochemical analyses, such as proteomic methods.   

Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biological 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention. In oncology, there is particular interest in the molecular changes underlying 
the oncogenic processes that may identify cancer subtypes, stage disease, assess the 
amount of tumor growth or predict disease progression, metastasis and responses to 
AMG 162. These investigations may be useful in developing markers to identify disease 
subtypes, guide therapy and/or predict disease progression. 

Serum samples obtained for exploratory purposes may be stored for up to 5 years at an 
Amgen designated central laboratory to research scientific questions related to cancer 
and AMG 162.  To maximize confidentiality, all samples and the information associated 
with them will be coded to prevent the exposure of the subject’s information and identity. 
This coding process allows Amgen to have the samples destroyed at the subject’s 
request.  The subject will continue to retain the right to have the biochemical analysis 
and biomarker development samples destroyed at any time by contacting the Principal 
Investigator. Amgen is responsible for the destruction of these sample(s) at the request 
of the research subject through the Principal Investigator, or at the end of the storage 
period.  The Principal Investigator will provide Amgen with the required study and 
subject numbers, so that any remaining serum samples and any other components from 
the cells can be located and destroyed.  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, Amgen will own the commercial product and there are no plans for the 
subject to receive financial rewards or compensation for the commercial product, data, 
information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample(s).

Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation 

All subjects will take a 1g daily supplement of calcium (e.g., calcium citrate, calcium 
carbonate) during the treatment phase. 

A baseline serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level will be measured.  Subjects with 25 (OH) 
vitamin D level < 12 ng/ml will not be eligible to enroll in the study. They may be treated

and re-screened. If the subject’s 25(OH) vitamin D level is between 12- 20 ng/ml, then 
the subject will be instructed to take at least 800 IU vitamin D daily.  All other subjects 
will be instructed to take at least 400 IU vitamin D daily. 

7.7 

Dual X ray Absorptiometry (DXA) Assessment  

All subjects will be requested to undergo bone densitometry assessments of the lumbar 
spine, total hip, 1/3 distal radius and total body performed by DXA per the schedule 
outlined in Appendix A. 

Only GE Lunar or Hologic bone densitometers will be used for the study and the same 
DXA machine must be used for all study procedures for a particular subject. Lumbar 
spine scans must include L1 through L4.  For the 1/3 distal radius, the left side should be 
used for all scans at all study visits.  If another side must be used or is inadvertently 
used at baseline, then it must be used consistently throughout the study.

Detailed instructions for scan acquisition will be provided in a separate manual provided 
by the central imaging center. 

7.7.1 

Screening DXA 

Densitometry measurements of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, radius and 
total body must be performed and analyzed by the local DXA technician to determine 
subject eligibility.  Subjects must have at least 2 evaluable lumbar vertebrae to be 
eligible for the study.  These scans will serve as the baseline scans if the subject is 
deemed eligible.  Subsequently, these scans must be submitted to the central imaging 
facility, which will reanalyze the scans for the inclusion in the study database. 

The BMD t-score must not be less than –2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass 
at any one of the following sites: lumbar spine, femoral neck or total hip. 

7.7.2 

On Study DXA 

On study bone densitometry assessment will be measured at the lumbar spine, femoral 
neck, total hip, 1/3 distal radius and total body as outlined in Appendix A.  For the 1/3 
distal radius, the left side should be used for all scans at all study visits.  If another side 
must be used or is inadvertently used at baseline, then it must be used consistently 
throughout the study.  All DXA scan data will be submitted electronically to the central 
imaging center for final blinded analysis. The results from the central imaging center will

be used as the final dataset.  Vertebrae that are unevaluable will be excluded from the 
lumbar spine DXA analysis. 

After analysis by the central imaging center, the study site may be asked to re-acquire a 
scan because of malpositioning or other technical reasons.  The investigative sites must 
comply with the requests from the central imaging center. The central imaging center will 
require that all study centers scan a set of standard phantoms at least once on the DXA 
machines used for this study.  This will be done in order to monitor DXA machine 
performance across study centers. Detailed instructions will be provided separately. 

The central imaging center over the course of the study will monitor BMD.  Investigators 
will be alerted to any subjects who lose more than 7% bone mass at any site within any 
12-month period of the study, or who have a t-score < -4 at any site during the study.  In 
this case, it is the obligation of the investigator to consider the subject’s status and to 
determine future management, including alternative therapies.

7.8.1 

Radiograph Assessments 

Lateral Spine Radiograph Assessments 

Radiographs of the lateral thoracic and lumbar spine will be acquired according to 
specific instructions provided by the central imaging vendor per the schedule outlined in 
Appendix A.  If a subject presents with acute back pain at a time point other than when a 
scheduled spinal radiograph is obtained, and occurrence of a vertebral fracture is 
suspected, the investigator should obtain a lateral spinal radiograph and submit it to the 
central imaging facility for evaluation. 

Vertebral fractures will be identified by visual inspection by an expert radiologist of 
digitized images of spinal radiographs taken on Study Day 1 and Month 24.  

Imaging will not be required during the safety follow up phase of the study.

For assessment of prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline, a generally accepted 
semiquantitative grading scale will be used (Genant et al, 1993): Grade 0, normal; Grade 
1, 20 to 25% reduction in vertebral height (anterior, middle, or posterior); Grade 2, 25 to 
40% reduction in height; Grade 3, greater than 40% reduction in height.  

For assessment of incident vertebral fracture, radiographs will be scored blinded to 
treatment but not to sequence.  The semiquantitative grading scale will be used.  The

exploratory endpoint is the incidence of vertebral fractures (ie, fractures in previously 
undeformed vertebrae). 

7.9 

Non-vertebral Fracture Recording 

Information about any new non-vertebral fractures while on study will be recorded.  A 
copy of radiographs (or equivalent imaging information such as MRI, CT, surgical 
report, etc.), confirming the fracture, as well as a copy of the radiologist’s report, should 
be obtained and included in the subject’s study records.  Copies of the radiographs (or 
equivalent) will be submitted to the central imaging center for digitization and 
confirmation of fracture, and copies of all radiologist reports should be kept in the 
subject’s records.  Radiology or surgical reports must be submitted to the central 
imaging center even if radiograph (or equivalent) is not available. 

7.10 

Bone and Cartilage Marker  

All subjects enrolled will have their serum Type I CTX and/or PINP levels monitored per 
the schedule outlined in Appendix A to assess the effect of AMG 162 treatment on bone 
turnover and cartilage degradation and other bone turn-over parameters. Serum 
samples will be collected at baseline, 1, 6, 12 and 24 months (Appendix A).  Subjects 
must be fasting for at least 8 hours prior to serum collection. 

7.11 

Concomitant Therapy 

All concomitant medications, including over-the-counter products, administered while the 
subject is enrolled in the study must be recorded on the case report form, listing generic 
name or trade name, indication, quantity administered, and date(s) of administration.

subject is removed from study medication, every effort should be made to continue 
evaluating adverse events through the End of Study visit (Month 24).  See Section 8.1 
for further details regarding minimal assessments requested (Appendix C).  Adverse 
events will be recorded on the case report form beginning on Study Day 1, at the time of 
initial investigational product administration. See Section 9 for details on AE.

REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS 

Removal of Subjects 

Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to her future medical care by the physician or at the institution. The 
investigator and sponsor also have the right to withdraw subjects from the study in the 
event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, protocol violation, or other reasons. 

Any subject who withdraws consent to participate in the study will be removed from 
further treatment and/or study observation immediately upon the date of request.  
During the treatment phase, a complete final evaluation (defined as procedures 
scheduled for End of Study visit) should be completed at time of subject’s withdrawal.  
Should a subject (or a legally acceptable representative) request or decide to withdraw 
from the treatment phase of the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report 
the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  All information 
should be reported on the applicable case report forms. 

Reasons for removal from investigational product might include: 

ineligibility 

(cid:120)  withdrawal of consent 
(cid:120)  administrative decision by the investigator or Amgen 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120)  significant protocol deviation 
(cid:120)  pregnancy (report on Pregnancy Notification Worksheet, see Appendix G) 
(cid:120)  patient noncompliance 
(cid:120)  adverse event (includes disease progression; report on adverse event CRF) 
During the treatment phase, subjects who develop any bone metastasis will be 
required to withdraw from the study.  In addition, if subjects stop aromatase inhibitor 
therapy during the study, they will be required to withdraw from the study. Withdrawal 
from study is not required if a subject develops distant metastatic disease or local 
recurrence provided that the disease is adequately treated.

During the safety follow up phase, subjects may withdraw their consent to 
participate at any time.  Alternately, subjects may be removed from the safety 
follow up phase of the study via an administrative decision by the investigator or 
Amgen.

8.2 

Removal From Study Medication  

The subject who requests to stop study treatment or has withdrawn from study treatment 
because of the investigator’s or sponsor’s concern before completion of the protocol-
specified treatment duration will continue the schedule of study observations, provided 
the subject has not withdrawn full consent. 

In addition, if a subject experiences an osteoporosis-related fracture (ie, vertebral 
fracture, hip fracture, etc.), or a significant decrease in BMD, (Section 7.7.2), the 
investigator should evaluate and discuss alternative treatment options with the subject.  
If a decision is made to remove the subject from study medication, every effort should be 
made to complete all her remaining study visits.

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 

Definitions  

9.1.1 

Adverse Events 

An adverse event (AE) is an undesirable medical occurrence (sign, symptom, or 
diagnosis) or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (diabetes, congestive heart 
failure, rheumatoid arthritis) that occurs after initiation of investigational product whether 
or not considered to be investigational product related. 

A worsening of an existing medical condition is one that was present at baseline (eg, 
cancer, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) and became more severe, more frequent, 
or increased in duration during investigational product treatment. 

Abnormal laboratory values should not be reported as adverse events; however, any 
clinical consequences of the abnormality should be reported as adverse events.

9.1.2 

Serious Adverse Events 

 

Page 43 of 91 

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined by regulatory agencies as one that suggests a 
significant hazard or side effect, regardless of the investigator or sponsor’s opinion on 
the relationship to investigational product.  This includes, but may not be limited to, any 
event that (at any dose): 

is fatal 
is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
is a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
A hospitalization meeting the regulatory requirement for the “serious” criteria is any 
inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health 
care facility. 

Hospitalizations for treatment of non-adverse events (ie, cosmetic surgery) are not 
considered serious adverse events.

v
o
r
p
p
A

Any event that does not exactly meet this definition yet, in the investigator’s opinion 
represents a significant hazard, can be assigned the “other significant hazard” regulatory 
reporting serious criteria. 

Additionally, important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization but that may jeopardize the subject or require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or result in urgent 
investigation, may be considered serious.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, 
convulsions, and blood dyscrasias. 

SAEs will be collected and reported throughout the study period beginning with the first 
dose of investigational product through the end of the safety follow up phase of the 
study.  If early termination occurs, SAEs will continue to be collected until the event 
resolves.

9.2 

Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 

All adverse events occurring after the first dose of investigational product observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject (whether or not attributed to investigational 
product), will be reported on the case report form. 

Medically significant adverse events considered related to the investigational product by 
the investigator or the sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable.  The 
investigator must assign the following attributes:  description; dates of onset and 
resolution; severity; assessment of relatedness to investigational product; and action 
taken.  The investigator may be asked to provide follow-up information. 

All deaths occurring on study must be reported to Amgen.  These include deaths within 
30 days of the last investigational product dose and deaths up to the last formal follow-
up observational period (Month 24), continuing through the safety follow up phase.  
Information from all medically confirmed deaths should be entered on a Serious Adverse 
Event Report form. Autopsy reports and relevant medical reports with the death 
summary (when available) should be faxed to the Amgen Global Safety Operations 
representatives specified below: 

For US centers:

The investigator should notify the IEC/IRB of serious adverse events occurring at the site 
and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local 
procedures. 

It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an adverse event is of 
sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment.  A subject may also 
voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable 
adverse event.  If either of these occurs, every effort should be made to complete all of 
her remaining study visits.  At minimum, if the subject is removed from study medication 
before the Month 24 visit, it is requested that she returns for her Month 24 assessment 
as scheduled.  If the subject refuses to complete further study visits, she must undergo 
an end-of-study assessment and be given appropriate care under medical supervision 
until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.  If the subject was permanently 
withdrawn from the study or investigational product due to a serious adverse event, this

The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events will be used to assess the 
severity of toxicities on the following scale with appropriate clinical definitions:  Grade 1 = 
Mild AE, Grade 2 = Moderate AE, Grade 3 = Severe AE, Grade 4 = Immediately life 
threatening or disabling AE, and Grade 5 = Death-related AE.  The relationship of 
adverse events to the investigational product will be assessed by means of the question: 
‘Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the 
investigational product?’  Answer Yes or No.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Study Design 

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-year study (with a 2-year safety 
follow up phase) is designed to evaluate the benefit of AMG 162 relative to placebo 
(calcium and vitamin D alone) in treatment of lumbar spine bone loss in women with 
non-metastatic breast cancer who are undergoing aromatase inhibitor treatment. 

The primary null hypothesis that there is no difference in percent of change of BMD for 
lumbar spine between AMG 162 and placebo after all subjects have completed the 
Month 12 study visit will be tested. 

The secondary efficacy endpoints listed in section 10.2.1 will be analyzed if the primary 
null hypothesis is rejected at the level of 0.05.  The Hochberg step-up procedure will be 
employed to adjust for the multiplicity in the analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints at 
level of 0.05.

Subsets 

Safety analyses will include all subjects who receive at least one dose of investigational 
product.  

Primary efficacy analyses will test hypothesis that there is no difference in percent 
change of lumbar spine BMD from baseline between subjects receiving AMG 162 and 
subjects receiving placebo.  Therefore, a post-baseline measurement is necessary for 
assessment of treatment effects.  The efficacy subset for analysis of BMD in lumbar 
spine, total hip and femoral neck will include all randomized subjects who have a 
baseline measure and at least one post-baseline measure at the time of analysis. 

All exploratory analyses will be conducted using all available subjects’ data at the time of 
analysis. 

10.3 

Sample Size Considerations 

This section provides a justification for the required number of subjects to be enrolled 
into this 24-month placebo-controlled study.  The sample size must provide adequate 
statistical power to detect a 2% difference between the AMG 162 and placebo groups in 
the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD after 12 months of randomized 
treatment.

Page 48 of 91 

The primary analysis is a comparison of percent change of lumbar spine BMD between 
the AMG 162 treatment and placebo groups after all subjects have had an opportunity to 
complete 12 months on study.  The primary endpoint will be tested at the 
significance level of 0.05. 

Based on the above assumptions, a sample size of 83 subjects per treatment arm will 
provide 95% power to detect a 2% difference (SD=3.5%) between AMG 162 dose and 
placebo in the percentage of change of BMD for lumbar spine at 12 months at an alpha 
level of 0.05. Considering a loss to follow-up DXA assessment rate of 20% per year, 104 
subjects in each group need to be enrolled for the detection of treatment effect.  The 
sample size was calculated using NQuery version 5.0. 

10.4 

External Data Monitoring Committee 

An external data monitoring committee (DMC) will be formed with members 
consisting of individuals chosen for their expertise in oncology and bone disease.  
The primary role of independent DMC is to protect the safety of the study 
participants throughout the treatment phase.  (There will be no DMC meetings for 
the safety extension phase of the study.) They will accomplish this by reviewing 
safety and efficacy analysis results in order to assess the risk-benefit profile for 
subjects enrolled in this study.  Access to both safety and efficacy will provide the 
DMC a broad perspective with which to generate recommendations for 
appropriate actions. The external individuals serving on the DMC will have access 
to subject’s individual treatment assignments. To minimize the potential 
introduction of bias, these individuals will not have direct contact with the study 
site personnel or subjects. The data for review are outlined in the DMC charter and 
agreed in advance by the DMC members. Unblinded reports for review will be 
generated by an independent CRO that is external to Amgen as well.  This 
independent DMC will convene at a minimum twice yearly, and the start date will 
depend on subject accrual rates.  Records of all meetings will be archived.

Recommendations of the DMC will be communicated by the DMC Chair to senior

management will be responsible for making decisions based on these 
recommendations.

10.5 

Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines 

Efficacy data will be reviewed along with the safety data at all DMC data review 
meetings. The purpose is to allow the DMC to balance any safety concerns with 
the potential for benefit, and to recommend stopping the trial if AMG 162 appears 
to be causing excess fractures. The DMC is requested not to recommend early 
stopping for efficacy unless, in their opinion, the benefit is so dramatic that it 
would be unethical to continue treating patients with placebo.  The study should 
not stop unless the result for new vertebral fracture achieves a p-value of 0.0005. 
Consistent with the testing procedure as described in the protocol, this would 
also require the BMD endpoints (lumbar spine BMD, total hip BMD, and femoral 
neck BMD) achieve a p-value of 0.0005. Because of the conservative nature of this 
procedure, no alpha adjustment to the type 1 error at the end of the trial (24-month 
treatment phase) will be made. 

10.6 

Planned Methods of Analysis 

10.6.1 

General Approach/Considerations 

The primary analytical approach for this study will be to use inferential testing to evaluate 
the efficacy of AMG 162 in the treatment of bone loss compared with placebo after 1 
year.  All efficacy analyses will be performed by randomized treatment, regardless of 
treatment received. 

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

If the protocol specifies multiple baseline measurements to be taken, the mean of the 
baseline records will be used for computation of change from baseline endpoints. 
Otherwise, baseline will be taken as the observation recorded just prior to first dose of 
test article. 

Continuous variables will be summarized descriptively using mean, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum.  Median and other selected percentiles will be substituted for 
mean and standard deviation for parameters exhibiting a lack of normality.   

Frequencies and percentages will be presented for categorical variables.

Analysis of Key Study Endpoints 

10.6.2.1  Efficacy Endpoints 

Bone Mineral Density 

The analysis of the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD to months 1, 3, 
6, 12 and 24 will employ a likelihood-based repeated measures model (Longford, 1993). 
Treatment group (AMG 162 or placebo), duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy ((cid:100)6 
months vs. > 6 months), baseline BMD value, machine type, baseline BMD value by 
machine type interaction, visit and visit by treatment interaction will be included as 
fixed effects.  Primary conclusions for BMD efficacy at the final analysis will be drawn 
using the point estimate for the least-squares mean and the two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the treatment difference (AMG 162 – placebo) at month 12. 

Additional methods for handling missing data will be applied to investigate the sensitivity 
of the results to missing evaluations.  These sensitivity analyses will play a supportive 
role in the interpretation of the results. The analyses of BMD for total hip, femoral neck, 
distal 1/3 radius, and total body will be conducted in the same manner. 

10.6.2.2  Safety Endpoints 

Adverse Events 

Subject incidence rates of all adverse events are to be tabulated by system organ class, 
preferred term, and severity during the 24-month treatment phase.  Tables and/or 
narratives of “on-study” deaths, serious and significant adverse events, including early 
withdrawals due to adverse events, will also be provided. 

Subject incidence rates of all adverse events during the safety follow-up phase 
will be summarized as well. 

Vital Signs 

Blood pressure, pulse, and temperature will be summarized descriptively over time by 
visit by mean, medium, standard deviation, standard error, minimum and maximum at 
each timepoint.

Clinical Laboratory Measurements  

 

Page 51 of 91 

Laboratory parameters will be summarized over time using grade shifts in recorded 
values from baseline to “worst” on-study value and from baseline to a particular visit.  
Graphical representations of aggregate data may also be presented. Continuously 
distributed analytes will be summarized descriptively across scheduled visit using the 
number of non-missing observations, mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, 
minimum, and maximum.  Frequencies and percentages will be presented for 
categorical variables. 

Anti-AMG 162 Antibodies 

Immunogenic response will be described by tabulating the numbers of subjects who 
tested positive (binding, neutralizing) for anti-AMG 162 antibodies in the subjects 
receiving at least one dose of AMG 162.  Subjects who test positive for either binding or 
neutralizing antibodies against AMG 162 will be interpreted as persistently positive if the 
antibody status remains positive on repeat testing. If a subject tests positive for 
neutralizing antibodies against AMG 162, the relationship between the presence of 
neutralizing antibodies, adverse events, and bone turnover will be evaluated.  
Immunogenic response will be listed by subject and visit date along with the serum AMG 
162 levels. 

Pharmacokinetics

Serum levels of AMG 162 will be summarized as the mean, median, standard deviation, 
standard error, minimum, and maximum at each timepoint. Any additional analysis of 
AMG 162 serum concentrations will be considered post-hoc and appropriately 
documented.

10.6.2.3  Exploratory Analyses 

Bone Metabolism 

Bone markers will be analyzed using non-parametric methodology since it is anticipated 
that the distribution of these parameters will deviate markedly from normality.  The 
stratified Rank test will be used to compare treatment groups with duration of aromatase 
inhibitor therapy at study entry as a stratification variable.

Vertebral Fracture  

 

Page 52 of 91 

Vertebral fracture subject incidence will be described as the proportion of subjects 
experiencing at least one vertebral fracture at the time of each analysis.  Whether or not 
subjects experience fracture (Y/N) will be compared between treatment groups using a
logistic regression model that includes the duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy at 
study entry ((cid:100) 6 months vs. > 6 months), and treatment group as independent 
variables. 

Non-vertebral Fracture 

Radiographs (or equivalent) of any non-vertebral fractures that occur will be obtained.  
For subjects not experiencing any non-vertebral fracture, their time to developing non-
vertebral fracture will be considered censored at their last observation time during the 
24-month treatment phase. All non-vertebral fractures, except those of the skull, face, 
fingers, and toes, which are typically not associated with osteoporosis, will be included in 
this analysis. 

The time to first non-vertebral fracture analyses will be conducted between AMG 162 
and placebo groups using a Cox semi-parametric model (Lawless, 1982) with treatment 
group as the independent variable and the duration of aromatase inhibitor as a 
stratification variable. The hazard ratio and its confidence interval compared with 
placebo will be reported. The time to first non-vertebral fracture will be summarized via 
displays of number of subject at risk, the percentage of subject that are censored, 
median, two-tailed 95% confidence intervals for the median, and Kaplan-Meier event 
rates at the time of analysis.  The Kaplan-Meier graphs will also be presented for all 
treatment groups.

during the 24-month treatment phase.  Overall survival analyses will be conducted 
between AMG 162 and placebo groups using a Cox semi-parametric model (Lawless, 
1982) with treatment group as the independent variable and the duration of aromatase

rates at month 24 and two-tailed 95% confidence intervals.  The Kaplan-Meier 
graphs will also be presented for all treatment groups. 

Biomarker Analysis 

Summary statistics will be provided as appropriate and the relationship between different 
parameters will be assessed. Statistical group comparisons for differences in biomarker 
results from samples taken before, during, and after AMG 162 treatment will be 
considered.

Amgen and the investigator.  Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to 
another party or move them to another location, he/she must notify Amgen in writing of 
the new responsible person and/or the new location. 

13.3 

Study Monitoring and Data Collection 

The Amgen representative and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the trial (eg, case report forms and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected. 

The Amgen monitor is responsible for inspecting the case report forms at regular 
intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, 
accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the

conduct of clinical research.  The monitor should have access to subject medical records 
and other study-related records needed to verify the entries on the case report forms. 

The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing case 
report forms, are resolved. 

In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Clinical Quality Assurance Department (or 
designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories) 
and review of study-related records will occur to evaluate the trial conduct and 
compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 

All paper case report forms should be typed or filled out with a black ballpoint pen and 
must be legible. 

(cid:120)  Corrections to paper forms will be made by a single line stroke through the error and 

insertion of the correction above or beside the error.  The change must be initialed 
and dated by the investigator or a member of the study staff authorized by the 
investigator on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  No erasures, correction 
fluid, or tape may be used.  Corrections to electronic forms will be automatically 
documented through the software’s “audit trail”. 

(cid:120)  To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 

management review will be performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During 
this review, subject data will be checked for consistency, omissions, and any 
apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data will be reviewed for adherence to the 
protocol and GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data 
management review process, data queries and/or site notifications will be sent to the 
site for completion and return to Amgen. 

(cid:120)  The principal investigator will sign and date the indicated places on the case report 

form.  These signatures will indicate that the principal investigator inspected or 
reviewed the data on the case report form, the data queries, and the site 
notifications, and agrees with the content. 

(cid:120)  Amgen’s clinical data management department will correct the database for the 

following CRF issues without notification to site staff:

Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by investigational 
product?  No___ Yes___ 

The descriptions provided below will help guide the principal investigator in making the 
decision  to choose either “yes” or “no”: 

No = There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
investigational product. 

The adverse event: 

(cid:120)  may be judged to be due to extraneous causes such as disease or environment or 

toxic factors 

(cid:120)  may be judged to be due to the subject’s clinical state or other therapy being 

Yes = There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
investigational product. 

The adverse event: 

(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 

follows a temporal sequence from administration of investigational product 
is a known response to the investigational product based on clinical or preclinical 
data 

(cid:120)  could not be explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state, 

environmental or toxic factors, or other therapy administered to the subject

Appendix D.  Adverse Events Standard Grading Score 

Grade 1 = MILD AE – aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated 

Grade 2 = MODERATE AE – discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity 

Grade 3 = SEVERE AE – incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity 

Grade 4 = LIFE-THREATENING or DISABLING AE – refers to an event in which the 

patient was, in the view of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event.  It 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe. 

Grade 5 = DEATH related to AE

Each box and the vial within the box will be labeled with a unique box number.  Upon the 
assignment of a box to a subject, the subject’s identification number and initials must be 
written on the box.   

Unique boxes will be assigned for each dose the subject will receive while on study.  To 
obtain box number assignments for a scheduled dose, site personnel should call the 
IVRS vendor. The box number of investigational product is to be recorded on each 
subject’s Drug Administration case report form.

In addition, the subject’s identification number, initials, randomization identification 
number and box number must be written on all appropriate drug accountability and 
dispensing records. 

The identity of investigational product assigned to subject numbers or to individual boxes 
of investigational product will be contained in the IVRS.  Authorized site staff will be

provided with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the IVRS to 
obtain unblinding information.  This PIN is unique to the individual and must not be 
shared. 

A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject.  Unblinding at the study 
site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. 

The principal investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Study Manager
before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working 
day after the event and must document the unblinding in the subject’s case report form.

Labeling

Labeling will comply with US FDA and local regulatory requirements. 

Storage

AMG 162 and placebo will be stored at the investigational site at 2 - 8° C.  Records of 
the actual storage conditions during the period of the study must be maintained, eg, 
records of the date, time and initials of person checking, and daily temperatures of the 
refrigerator used for storage of trial supplies, continuous temperature recordings or 
regularly maintained temperature alarm systems. 

Amgen Inc. or its designee must be notified if any test material is exposed to excessive 
or uncontrolled temperatures, in which case possible replacement of the material will be 
considered. 

Preparation 

Each box will contain one 1-mL vial.  A single 1.0 mL syringe should be used to prepare 
the dose.    

There is no other special preparation required prior to investigational product 
administration.   

Supply and Return of Drug 

At study initiation and as needed thereafter, investigational product will be shipped to a
responsible person (eg, a pharmacist) at the investigator’s institution, who will check the

Protocol Number AMG 162 20040135 

A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate AMG 162 in 
the Treatment of Bone Loss in Subjects Undergoing Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy 

For Non-metastatic Breast Cancer 

1. 

a. 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION 

What is this document?  

You are being invited to participate in a research study, also known as a clinical trial, of a 
drug called AMG 162.  AMG 162 is being evaluated in the treatment of bone loss in 
women with non-metastatic breast cancer undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy.  

This informed consent document will provide you with information about this study.  If 
you have questions at any time during the reading of this document, please ask your 
doctor or the study nurse to explain any words or information you do not understand.  If 
you agree to participate in this research study, prior to signing this informed consent, you 
should be sure all your questions are answered and that you understand your rights as a 
study subject.  You will be given a signed copy of this form to keep. 

b. 

What is a research study?  

A research study or “clinical trial” is a drug study sponsored by a pharmaceutical or 
biotechnology company. The purpose of these studies is to find out whether a 
medication is safe to use and effective against various diseases or medical conditions.

c. 

What is the purpose of this research study?  

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

Bone is constantly being broken down and built up throughout a person’s lifetime.  The 
entire skeleton is replaced about every seven to eight years.  The breaking down and 
building up of bone is called bone turnover.  If bone turnover is balanced (bone is being 
broken down at the same rate as bone is being built), then bone mass will remain about 
the same.  The higher the bone mass, the stronger the bone, and the less likely the bone 
will break when under stress. 

Osteoporosis is a disease of the bone that affects an estimated 75 million people 
worldwide and is characterized by a low bone mass.  The low bone mass is thought to 
be a result of the bone breaking down faster than it is being built.  Patients suffering from 
osteoporosis have an increased risk of breaking their bones, often the hipbone or 
vertebrae (backbones).  There are many causes of osteoporosis, the most common 
being due to the decrease in estrogen levels seen with the onset of menopause. 

Treatment of breast cancer is initially targeted at removal of the tumor and preventing 
the spread of tumor cells. Subsequent treatment can include aromatase inhibitor therapy 
which is a type of hormone deprivation therapy to lower the estrogen level in the tumor. 
Because of the endocrine changes induced by cancer treatment (chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy and hormone ablation), women with breast cancer are at increased risk of 
developing osteoporosis.

Version Date:  14 November 2006 

 

Amgen Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Amgen”) has designed a novel protein, AMG 162, 
which has been shown in animal studies to regulate bone metabolism by inhibiting the 
cells that break down bone.  This results in a slower rate that bone is broken down and 
an increase in bone mass. 

Amgen is conducting a research study to evaluate the effect of AMG 162 on the bone 
mineral density of the lumbar spine in women with non-metastatic breast cancer 
undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy.  The research study will also look at the effect 
of AMG 162 on bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, total hip (upper part of the 
leg/hip), total body and 1/3 distal radius (part of the arm). Safety and tolerability of AMG 
162 will also be assessed.   

d. 

Who is funding this clinical study? 

Amgen, a for-profit drug company, is funding this clinical study.  Amgen is the "sponsor" 
of the study, which means that Amgen designed the study and drafted the study plan. 

e. 

Why have I been asked to participate in this study? 

You are being asked to participate in this study because you are undergoing aromatase-
inhibitor therapy for the treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer and your BMD t-score 
is –1 to –2.5 (osteopenic range).  In addition, you have not taken any drugs that have an 
effect on bone metabolism (eg, teriparatide, calcitonin, raloxifene, estrogen, 
corticosteroids, testosterone, tibolone) within the last 6 weeks. If you have had 
bisphosphonates in the past, you have gone the minimum time without taking them to 
participate in the study (your doctor will ask you detailed questions about your past use 
of these drugs to determine your eligibility). Additionally, you do not have any conditions 
that might affect bone metabolism (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, Paget’s disease, Cushing’s 
disease, etc). 

f. 

How many other people like me (subjects) will be participating in this 
study?  

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

You will be one of about 208 people who will ultimately participate in this study at about 
40 clinics in the United States and Canada.

g. 

What kind of test drug(s) will be tested in this study? 

The test drug that will be evaluated in this study is called AMG 162.  It is similar to an 
antibody that is found in your body and stops the cells that destroy bone.  If it is 
determined that you meet the entrance criteria, you will then be randomly assigned to 
receive one of two treatment options:   

1.  60 mg AMG 162 subcutaneous injection one time every 6 months 

2.  placebo subcutaneous injection one time every 6 months 

AMG 162 or placebo is given as one subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.  You will 
also be provided with calcium and vitamin D supplements which you should take on a 
daily basis.

h. 

What are my chances that I will get the test drug? 

You will have a 1 in 2 chance (like flipping a coin) of receiving investigational product 
(AMG 162).

i. 

Will I know which treatment product I am receiving?  

No, this is a “double-blind” study, which means that neither you nor you doctor will know 
which drug you will receive.  In order to maintain a double blind, regardless of which 
treatment group you are assigned, you will receive an injection.  If you are assigned to 
receive the AMG 162 dose, then your injection will contain AMG 162. If you are assigned 
to receive placebo, your injection will be a solution containing no drug. 

j. 

Who decides if I get the test drug product or something else? 

You will be randomized by chance to receive investigational product or placebo. Your 
doctor will not be able to choose which test drug you will receive.

k. 

How long is the study?  

The total duration of the study is 24 months (2 years).  While enrolled in the study, you 
will receive investigational product or placebo every 6 months for 18 months, you will be 
asked to return at 24 months for a final evaluation.  In addition, there will be a 24-
month safety follow up phase.  

l. 

How often will I need to visit the hospital, clinic, or doctor’s office?  

There are 3 phases to the study: a screening phase to determine if you are eligible to 
participate in the study, a 24-month treatment phase and a 24-month safety follow up 
phase.  The screening phase should only take one or two visits (depending on 
scheduling within your clinic).  During the treatment phase, you will be asked to visit your 
doctor on study Day 1, one month after your first dose, then at 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 24 
months after your first dose.  During the safety follow up phase, safety data will be 
collected by clinic visit or telephone contact approximately every 6 months for up 
to 2 years after the Month 24 study visit.

A

m.  What will I be responsible for if I participate in this study?  

You will be asked to take daily supplements of calcium and vitamin D during the 
treatment phase, which will be supplied by your study doctor. 

During each clinic visit, you will be asked about the medications you have taken and if 
you have experienced any side effects or developed any new medical problems since 
your last visit.  If you have any fracture, you should contact your study doctor as soon as 
possible. 

While participating in the study, you will not be allowed to take certain medications.
These include bisphosphonates (like pamidronate, zoledronate, alendronate or 
risedronate), tibolone, corticosteroids, fluoride for osteoporosis, strontium, hormone 
replacement therapy (like estrogen), SERMs (like raloxifene, tamoxifen), calcitonin, 
calcitriol, teriparatide, or drugs known to have activity on bone metabolism (except 
calcium and vitamin D).

n. 

What happens when the research study ends? 

Your involvement in the treatment phase of the study will be for a maximum of 24 
months, and if you agree to participate in the safety follow up phase, your 
involvement may continue for another 24 months.  However, you may withdraw from 
this study any time you wish.  You will not be asked to withdraw from the study if you 
develop a medical event related to your bones (ie, fracture or elevated blood calcium 
levels), unless you and your physician feel it would be appropriate for your specific 
medical condition. Should you decide to withdraw before the end of the study, your 
doctor may request that you come in for a complete physical exam, X ray, DXA and 
blood samples.  If at the end of the study you are experiencing any adverse experience 
related to the investigational product or have a laboratory abnormality felt by your doctor 
or Amgen to be clinically significant, you will be asked to come back for additional tests 
until the adverse experience or laboratory abnormality resolves.

STUDY PROCEDURES 

What types of tests or procedures are involved with this study?  

This study has a screening phase, a treatment phase and a safety follow up 
phase.

SCREENING PHASE: In order to determine whether you are eligible to participate in this 
study, you will be required to have what is called a “Screening” visit.  If you have signed 
the informed consent form, you will have the following procedures during this visit: 

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

(cid:131)  Your complete medical history will be taken, including disease and medication 

history. 

(cid:131)  You will have a physical examination, including being weighed, and having your 
vital signs taken (blood pressure, temperature, and pulse). If you are a woman 
who could be pregnant, a urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed to 
ensure you are not pregnant before you can receive the study treatment as it 
may carry unknown or possible risk to a fetus.  

(cid:131)  You will have a DXA (bone density) scan of your spine, total hip, total body and 

radius. 

(cid:131)  You will have blood drawn for laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology). The total 

blood required will be about 7 mL (1.5 teaspoons).

TREATMENT PHASE: The doses of AMG 162 that will be used in this study will be 
given by subcutaneous injection (under the skin) every six months. You may receive one 
of the following doses of AMG 162 for 18 months: placebo (a solution containing no 
active drug); or 60 mg AMG 162.  If you qualify for the study, you will be randomized into 
one of the treatment groups just described for 24 months.  

All subjects will be provided calcium and vitamin D, both in the form of a tablet or 
capsule.  You will be required to take these on a daily basis for the duration of the study. 

If you decide to participate in the study, you will be required to visit your doctor 
periodically for study procedures and check-ups on Study Day 1 (Baseline visit), after 1 

AMG 162 20040135

month, and then at 3, 6, 12, 15, 18 until 24-month time point. You will have assessments 
at each of these visits as outlined below. 

Exploratory Samples

Exploratory sample collection is designed to develop blood laboratory test(s) that may 
help to identify patients who are most likely to be helped by AMG 162. One of the goals 
of this study is to develop tests that will identify persons with cancer who will have the 
best possible response to AMG 162. 

For these studies, about three teaspoonfuls of blood will be obtained prior to treatment 
with AMG 162 and on months 12 and 24,or discontinuation of the drug for any reason, in 
an effort to determine if there are changes in how proteins are regulated in response to 
the drug.  This is called proteomic analysis. 

These plasma and serum, samples may be stored for up to 5 years at an Amgen 
designated central laboratory. All samples and information associated with the samples 
will be coded using labels with a unique code number to prevent the exposure of your 
information and identity (see Section 7 on Confidentiality for more details).  You will 
retain the right to have the exploratory sample material destroyed at any time by 
contacting the Principal Investigator.  

If a commercial product is developed from this research project, Amgen will own the 
commercial product and there are no plans for you to receive financial rewards or 
compensation for the commercial product, data, information, discoveries, or derivative 
materials gained or produced from the sample.  Amgen is responsible for the destruction 
of the exploratory sample(s) at your request or at the end of the storage period. The 
Principal Investigator will provide Amgen with the required study and subject’s numbers, 
so that plasma and serum can be located and destroyed. 

Baseline/Study Day 1 (some of these procedures may be done on more than one visit, 
but before the administration of your first dose of investigational product):  

d

(cid:131)  You will have an X ray of your spine  

(cid:131)  You will have another physical exam, unless your previous exam was within the 

past week. 

(cid:131)  You will have your vital signs taken again, including blood pressure, temperature, 

and pulse. 

(cid:131)  You will have blood drawn for laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and 

serum estrogen), 25 (OH) vitamin D, bone markers, serum AMG 162 level, an 
AMG 162 antibody assay (to make sure your body isn’t making proteins to fight

SAFETY – POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 

What are the general risks of participating in this research study?  

AMG 162 may cause all, some or none of the adverse events listed below.  
Adverse events are undesirable medical conditions or a worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition that may occur while you are enrolled in the 
study.  Rare or unforeseeable adverse events, which could be serious, may 
occur.  You will be monitored for any adverse occurrences.  If you 
experience any change in your medical condition or develop any 
symptoms associated with possible side effects described below during 
the study you should notify your doctor immediately. 

b. 

What are the known adverse effects in subjects receiving this 
investigational product or placebo? 

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

More than 5,000 subjects have been treated with AMG 162 in clinical 
studies.  AMG 162 has been generally well tolerated. 

A transient decrease in blood calcium levels below normal has been 
observed in some subjects.  In rare cases, clinical symptoms of low 
calcium levels were observed. Symptoms of decreased calcium may 
include a tingling sensation, muscle cramping or an abnormal heart rate.
Your physician may administer calcium intravenously to treat these 
symptoms.  During the study, if you experience any of these symptoms 
possibly associated with low calcium, you should notify your doctor 
immediately. 

In patients receiving AMG 162, the most frequent adverse events occurring 
very commonly (>=10%) in clinical trials included upper respiratory tract 
infection or inflammation (such as sore throat); nausea, headache, pain in 
joints, back and extremities, urinary tract infection, constipation, bone
pain, weakness, fatigue, flu, high blood pressure, upset stomach, vomiting, 
rheumatoid arthritis (in patients with rheumatoid arthritis only) and 

AMG 162 20040135 

Page 9 of 16 

Version Date:  14 November 2006 

 

diarrhea.

AMG 162 may have the potential to alter your immune system, which acts 
to protect you against infections.  However, in clinical trials to date, no 
evidence of immune system suppression has been observed. 

Development of antibodies to AMG 162 in patients has been uncommon.
Antibodies are proteins made by the body to attack a foreign substance 
that the body thinks is harmful.  If you develop antibodies to AMG 162, it is 
unknown whether these antibodies would affect you in any way.  To date, 
no clinical effects have been observed in patients who have developed 
antibodies to AMG 162.  These antibodies may or may not inactivate the 
action of AMG 162.

In some patients receiving bisphosphonates for treatment of bone loss or 
cancer that involves the bone, a condition known as osteonecrosis of the 
jaw (ONJ), may result. ONJ may be associated with pain and/or infection of 
the jaw bone, teeth or gums resulting in a non-healing area of exposed 
bone in the mouth. How this happens is poorly understood. Most patients 
have had tooth removal, gum surgery, dental implants or other invasive 
dental procedures before developing this condition. AMG 162 works on the 
bone in a different way than bisphosphonates. The potential risk of ONJ in 
patients receiving AMG 162 at this time remains unknown.  

As with any medication, you may experience an allergic reaction to the 
injection.  This may include mild reactions such as skin rash, but may also 
be severe, for example, causing a decrease in blood pressure or difficulty 
breathing.  If you experience any of these symptoms during the study, you 
should notify your doctor immediately.

The effect of AMG 162 on bone resorption appears fully reversible and 
discontinuing the drug can lead to reversal of the gains made in your bone 
density. To ensure these losses in bone density are not excessive, if you 
discontinue AMG 162, you should be followed carefully.  Alternative 
approaches to maintaining prior gains should also be discussed with your 
physician.

c. 

What are the known adverse effects of the procedures that will be done in 
this research study?   

Injections:

As with any injection, there may be some irritation at the injection site 
where the investigational product is administered.  Injection site adverse 
reactions have been observed commonly in subjects receiving AMG 162.  
These could include bruising, pain, bleeding and rarely, infection at the 
injection site. 

Blood Draws:

You will have your blood drawn periodically throughout the study.  
Possible side effects of blood draws are pain, bruising, bleeding or 

AMG 162 20040135 

Page 10 of 16 

Version Date:  14 November 2006 

 

infection at the site of the needle puncture.  Blood draws may also cause 
temporary headache, nausea, and lightheadedness. 

Spinal X Ray:

You will have x-rays taken of your spine.  You will be asked to lie down on 
an x-ray table or stand.  The radiology technologist will position you to 
obtain different x-ray views.  You will be asked to hold your breath briefly 
when the x-rays are being taken.  The x-rays are used to identify any 
fractures, dislocations, thinning of the bone, or deformities in the curvature 
of the spine.  There is low radiation exposure for the x-ray series. The 
amount of radiation received is approximately half of the annual naturally 
occurring background radiation from natural sources (sun, soil, food, 
water) to which a person is exposed.   

DXA Scan: 

You will have DXA (Dual-Energy X-ray absorptiometry) scans to measure 
your bone density.  This will be done with a DXA scanner.  This scan 
involves lying on a table while the scan is being taken.  The DXA scan is 
painless and will take 10 to 30 minutes.  The amount of radiation received is 
approximately 1 – 2 days of naturally occurring background radiation from 
natural sources (sun, soil, food water) to which a person is exposed.

Calcium Supplements: 

The following side effects occur very rarely when calcium supplements are 
taken as recommended:  difficult or painful urination, unusually large 
amount of urine, or increased frequency of urination, nausea or vomiting 
(continuous), constipation (severe), loss of appetite, dryness of mouth, 
increased thirst, metallic taste, weakness or unusual tiredness, headache 
(continuing), irritability, drowsiness, depression, confusion, high blood 
pressure, increased sensitivity of eyes or skin to light and irregular, fast, or 
slow heartbeat.  

Check with your study doctor as soon as possible if any of these side 
effects occur. 

Vitamin D Supplements: 

Although these supplements do not usually cause side effects when taken 
as directed, you should notify your doctor immediately if you have any of 
the following possible side effects of vitamin D:  bone pain, muscle pain, 
nausea or vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, metallic taste, 
dryness of mouth, weight loss, runny nose, increased thirst, increase in 
amount and frequency of urination, especially at night, cloudiness or 
protein in the urine, irregular heartbeat, headache (continuing), drowsiness, 
unusual tiredness or weakness, calcium deposits (hard lumps) in tissues 
outside of the bone, itching of skin, loss of sex drive, mood or mental 
change, increased sensitivity of eyes to light or irritation of eyes, redness 
or discharge of the eye, eyelid, or lining of the eyelid, and runny nose.

Check with your study doctor as soon as possible if any of these side 
effects occur. 

d. 

Can the adverse events of this investigational product or study-specific 
procedures be harmful to my family, my offspring, or me? 

There is a chance you may have side effects that have not been seen before with 
the use of AMG 162.  There also may be risks that are unknown at the present 
time.  Your study physician will tell you if we learn anything that might affect your 
decision to continue with this study.  If significant new findings develop during the 
course of the study that might affect your willingness to continue to participate, 
they will be reported to you and/or your legally acceptable representative as soon 
as possible.  At the discretion of your physician and Amgen, you or your legally 
acceptable representative may be asked to sign a revised informed consent or 
consent addendum that provides this information.  If you have any worries or 
concerns about this study at any time you should contact (cid:31)(cid:31)Study Physician’s 
name at 24-hour phone number. (cid:33)(cid:33)

o
r
p
p
A

If you are able to become pregnant, you must have a negative pregnancy 
test before the start of treatment.  You may not take part in this study if you 
are pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant during the study or if you are 
a nursing mother. 

If you or your partner are capable of becoming pregnant and you wish to 
participate in this study, you must use a medically acceptable method of 
birth control while taking part in this research study.  Because the risks of 
the experimental treatment to an unborn or newborn child are not known, 
you or your partner must not become pregnant during the study.  If you or 
your partner become pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant while 
participating in this study, you must notify the investigator immediately.  If 
you become pregnant while participating in the study, treatment with the 
investigational product will be stopped.  You should also avoid becoming 
pregnant for a period of six months immediately following the last dose of 
AMG 162.  Amgen may request the investigator obtain additional 
information from you regarding the course of the pregnancy.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS 

What are the expected therapeutic benefits of this test drug? 

It is expected that treatment with AMG 162 will have a beneficial effect on bone 
mineral density, leading to a reduced risk for future bone fractures. It is not 
expected that AMG 162 will have any direct effect on your cancer. Whether or not 
it affects tumor growth positively or negatively is unknown.

b. 

Will I benefit from participating in this research study?  Will others? 

The main goal of this research study is to provide scientific information and it is 
not known whether you will receive any medical benefit.  It is possible that your 
bone density may increase, leading to a reduced risk for future bone fractures. 

5. 

a. 

ALTERNATIVE THERAPY 

If I choose not to participate in this study, are there other treatments or 
medications available to me, instead of this research drug? 

This is a research study and does not constitute treatment or therapy.  Alternative 
treatment is available for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis (for 
example, bisphosphonates, estrogen, and teriparatide).  You should discuss this 
with your doctor. 

b. 

Are there benefits with these other treatments?  Are there risks? 

The benefits of these other treatments are that they are proven in people with 
your disease to be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of osteoporosis.  
There are risks associated with the use of each of them, including 
stomach/intestinal problems (bisphosphonates), and cancer risk (estrogens, HRT 
and teriparatide).

Amendment Date: 

14 November 2006 

Rationale:

The primary reason for this amendment is to add new safety information about 
denosumab described in the newly revised denosumab investigator brochure, to add 
a safety follow up phase to the study design, and to allow non-vertebral fractures to 
be confirmed by a variety of conventional imaging methods or reporting (the 
requirement is no longer limited to confirmation by x-ray only).  The study schema, 
study glossary, table of contents, references, schedule of assessments and sample 
subject informed consent were updated accordingly, and other revisions were made 
throughout the protocol to correct typographical, formatting and administrative errors 
and/or inconsistencies.

Section:  2.2.2, Safety Profile 
Replace:
As of 31 January 2004, a total of 680 subjects have enrolled into 1 of 6 clinical studies 
(20010123, 20010124, 20010223, 20030164, 20030148, and 20030180) and have 
received at least 1 dose of investigational product (AMG 162, matching placebo, or 
active control).  A total of 546 subjects have received AMG 162.  Single doses up to 3 
mg/kg SC or IV (weight-based) and 210 mg SC (fixed dose) have been studied.   

AMG 162 is a biological response modifier with bone antiresorptive properties 
administered by SC injection.  The most likely potential side effects that subjects may 
experience after AMG 162 administration are hypocalcemia, injection site reactions, and 
an antibody response to AMG 162.  With any potent bone antiresorptive agent, there is 
the possibility of acute hypocalcemia since the release of calcium from bone may be 
blocked.  Homeostatic compensatory mechanisms, such as increases in parathyroid 
hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D typically correct this transient hypocalcemia.  
Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia have not been observed in any of the preclinical 
or clinical studies with AMG 162.  There is some preclinical evidence that AMG 162 
administration may have an effect on the immune system.  RANKL, through binding to 
its receptor, could affect immature T-cell development.  However, in studies investigating 
the effect of RANKL blockade on the immune system (Stolina et al, 2003), there were no 
detrimental effects on the immune system, and in clinical studies, no effect on white 
blood cells (WBC) or T and B cell subsets has been observed.  Since AMG 162 is 
produced in mammalian cells, subjects with a previously unidentified allergy to 
mammalian-derived proteins may be at risk.  No significant hypersensitivity reactions 
have been reported and no anti-AMG 162 antibody has been observed in clinical studies 
to date.

In a Phase 1 study conducted in 105 postmenopausal women (20010124), 79 subjects 
receiving AMG 162 (up to a single dose of 3 mg/kg) and 26 receiving placebo, there 
were no severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse events. No subjects withdrew 
prematurely due to an adverse event.  Two subjects, who had received single SC doses 
of AMG 162, reported serious adverse events that were moderate in severity and were 
deemed not related to investigational product (abdominal pain and cholelithiasis).  The 
subject incidence of adverse events greater than 10% by preferred term in descending 
order of frequency in this study included headache NOS (not otherwise specified), back 
pain, upper respiratory tract infection NOS, cough, nasal congestion, nausea, 
pharyngolaryngeal pain, syncope, pain in limb, abdominal pain NOS, and arthralgia.  
Back pain, cough, and abdominal pain were observed more commonly in subjects 
receiving AMG 162 than in subjects receiving placebo.

No clinically significant changes in any laboratory parameter associated with the 
pharmacologic effect of AMG 162 were observed.  Five subjects, 3 receiving IV and 2 
receiving SC AMG 162, had transient decreases in albumin-adjusted calcium levels 
below 2 mmol/L.  The lowest recorded level of albumin-adjusted calcium level was 1.85 
mmol/L and occurred in a subject 8 days after the administration of 0.1 mg AMG 162 
SC.  Other recorded albumin-adjusted calcium levels below 2 mmol/L ranged 1.93 to 
1.98 mmol/L occurred in subjects 5 to 15 days after the administration of 0.01 mg/kg, 
0.03 mg/kg, and 0.1 mg/kg AMG 162 IV; and 0.1 mg/kg AMG 162 SC.  None of these 
subjects required treatment for hypocalcemia and there were no clinical symptoms of 
hypocalcemia. Injection site reactions were uncommon. None of the subjects had 
evidence of anti-AMG 162 antibodies in the antibody assays. 

In an ongoing Phase 2 study in 411 postmenopausal women with low BMD, AMG 162 is 
administered SC either once every 3 months (3-monthly) (6 to 30 mg) or once every 6 
months (6-monthly) (14 to 210 mg).  The study includes an alendronate 70 mg weekly 
oral administration open-label control group.  The data from a 6-month interim analysis 
in this study indicate that AMG 162 is well tolerated.  An examination of the adverse 
event and laboratory profiles indicated that there was no safety concern with AMG 162.  
A total of 4.3%, 4.1%, and 0% of subjects had serious adverse events in the placebo, 
AMG 162, and alendronate groups, respectively.  No deaths were reported.  One subject 
who received 14 mg AMG 162 3-monthly had a grade 2 decrease in albumin-adjusted 
serum calcium (1.95 mmol/L) at month 2; no clinical sequelae were associated with this 
low serum calcium value.  No changes of note were observed in vital signs or 
electrocardiogram examinations.  One subject, who received 100 mg AMG 162 6-
monthly, tested positively for anti-AMG 162 antibodies using a binding assay but tested 
negatively in the bioassay.  The antibodies in this subject were only detected at month 1 
and not at subsequent time points.  In addition, no evidence of an effect on 
pharmacokinetics or bone turnover marker levels was observed in this subject.

As of 24 March 2006, over 11,400 subjects have enrolled into clinical studies and 
have received at least 1 dose of investigational product (AMG 162, matching 
placebo, or active control).  Over 5,000 subjects have received AMG 162.  Single 
doses up to 3 mg/kg SC or IV (weight-based) and 210 mg SC (fixed dose) have 
been studied.

AMG 162 has been generally well tolerated in the clinical studies conducted to 
date.  No unexpected adverse events of clinical concern have been observed.
Adverse events that have been considered by an investigator to be related to 
AMG 162 treatment have generally been diverse and mild to moderate in severity. 

Safety data available from five phase 1 studies that have been completed and a 
phase 2 study that has completed 24-months of treatment in which data is 
available have demonstrated the tolerability of AMG 162.  The incidence of 
adverse events, including serious adverse events, was similar between subjects 
who received AMG 162 and those who received the active comparator or placebo 
treatment.  Evaluation of vital signs and ECGs indicated no notable changes in 
AMG 162-treated subjects compared with control-treated subjects. No clinically 
significant trends indicative of an AMG 162 treatment effect were noted in clinical 
laboratory measurements.  Expected changes in bone turnover markers and

serum albumin-adjusted calcium associated with the pharmacologic action of 
AMG 162 were observed.  Transient hypocalcemia has been observed in some 
subjects participating in clinical studies with AMG 162.  In most cases, the 
incidences of hypocalcemia were not associated with any clinical symptoms.  
The detection of binding antibodies to AMG 162 in subjects has been uncommon. 
However when detected, these antibodies were of a transient nature and did not 
neutralize the biological activity of AMG 162 when tested in a bioassay.  No 
evidence of an effect on pharmacokinetics or bone turnover marker levels was 
observed in the subjects who developed binding antibodies. 

Interim results from a phase 2 study in postmenopausal women showed that the 
effect of AMG 162 on bone resorption appears to be fully reversible.  
Discontinuing AMG 162 may lead to reversal of the gains made in bone density.  
To ensure these losses in bone density are not excessive, patients who 
discontinue AMG 162 should be followed carefully.  Alternative approaches to 
maintaining prior gains need to be discussed with the patient.

safety data summaries that are masked to actual treatment identification. To minimize 
the potential introduction of bias, these individuals will not have any direct contact with 
the study site personnel or subjects. 

Members of this external DMC will include, at a minimum, physicians external to Amgen, 
and appropriate statistical representation external to Amgen.  Unblinded reports of safety 
data for review will be generated by entities that are external to Amgen as well.  This

Section 10.5, Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines 
Replace:
There is no planned interim analysis in this study.  The DMC will conduct periodic safety 
reviews during the study.  The DMC may recommend early discontinuation of the study if 
an extreme effect of treatment on both BMD and new vertebral fracture endpoints is 
detected such that it would be unethical to continue. 

With:
Efficacy data will be reviewed along with the safety data at all DMC data review 
meetings. The purpose is to allow the DMC to balance any safety concerns with 
the potential for benefit, and to recommend stopping the trial if AMG 162 appears 
to be causing excess fractures. The DMC is requested not to recommend early 
stopping for efficacy unless, in their opinion, the benefit is so dramatic that it 
would be unethical to continue treating patients with placebo.  The study should 
not stop unless the result for new vertebral fracture achieves a p-value of 0.0005. 
Consistent with the testing procedure as described in the protocol, this would 
also require the BMD endpoints (lumbar spine BMD, total hip BMD, and femoral 
neck BMD) achieve a p-value of 0.0005. Because of the conservative nature of this 
procedure, no alpha adjustment to the type 1 error at the end of the trial (24-month 
treatment phase) will be made.

Adverse Events 
Replace:
Subject incidence rates of all adverse events are to be tabulated by system organ class, 
preferred term, and severity.  Tables and/or narratives of “on-study” deaths, serious and 
significant adverse events, including early withdrawals due to adverse events, will also 
be provided.

Subject incidence rates of all adverse events are to be tabulated by system organ class, 
preferred term, and severity during the 24-month treatment phase.  Tables and/or 
narratives of “on-study” deaths, serious and significant adverse events, including early 
withdrawals due to adverse events, will also be provided. 

Subject incidence rates of all adverse events during the safety follow-up phase 
will be summarized as well.

Anti-AMG 162 Antibodies 
Replace:
The frequencies and percentages of subjects exhibiting anti-AMG 162 antibodies at any 
time and by visit will be tabulated. 

With:
Immunogenic response will be described by tabulating the numbers of subjects 
who tested positive (binding, neutralizing) for anti-AMG 162 antibodies in the 
subjects receiving at least one dose of AMG 162.  Subjects who test positive for 
either binding or neutralizing antibodies against AMG 162 will be interpreted as 
persistently positive if the antibody status remains positive on repeat testing. If a 
subject tests positive for neutralizing antibodies against AMG 162, the 
relationship between the presence of neutralizing antibodies, adverse events, and 
bone turnover will be evaluated.  Immunogenic response will be listed by subject 
and visit date along with the serum AMG 162 levels.

Vertebral Fracture 
Replace:
Whether or not subjects experience fracture (Y/N) will be compared between treatment 
groups using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel two-sided tests (Agresti, 1990) stratified for the 
duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy at study entry ((cid:100) 6 months vs. > 6 months).An 
exploratory analysis will be conducted including both treatment and variables listed in 
Section Error! Reference source not found. as covariates in a logistic regression 
model.

With:
Whether or not subjects experience fracture (Y/N) will be compared between treatment 
groups using a logistic regression model that includes the duration of aromatase 
inhibitor therapy at study entry ((cid:100) 6 months vs. > 6 months), and treatment group as 
independent variables.

Non-Vertebral Fracture 
Replace:
Radiographs of any non-vertebral fractures that occur will be obtained.  For subjects not 
experiencing any non-vertebral fracture, their time to developing non-vertebral fracture 
will be considered censored at their last observation time on the study. All non-vertebral 
fractures, except those of the skull, face, fingers, and toes, which are typically not 
associated with osteoporosis, will be included in this analysis. 

With:
Radiographs (or equivalent) of any non-vertebral fractures that occur will be obtained.  
For subjects not experiencing any non-vertebral fracture, their time to developing non-
vertebral fracture will be considered censored at their last observation time during the 
24-month treatment phase. All non-vertebral fractures, except those of the skull, face, 
fingers, and toes, which are typically not associated with osteoporosis, will be included in 
this analysis.

Overall Survival 
Replace:
For surviving subjects, overall survival will be censored at their last observation time on 
study.  Overall survival analyses will be conducted between AMG 162 and placebo 
groups using a Cox semi-parametric model (Lawless, 1982) with treatment group as the 
independent variable and the duration of aromatase inhibitor as a stratification variable. 
The hazard ratio and its confidence interval compared with placebo will be reported.  
Each endpoint will also be summarized via displays of number of subject at risk, the 
percentage of subject that are censored, median, two-tailed 95% confidence intervals for 
the median, and Kaplan-Meier event rates at the time of analysis.  The Kaplan-Meier 
graphs will also be presented for all treatment groups.
