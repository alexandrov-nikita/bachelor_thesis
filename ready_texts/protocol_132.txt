Study Title: 
A Randomized Phase III Study of Weekly ABI-007 plus Gemcitabine versus Gemcitabine 
Alone in Patients with Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas  
Study Number: 
CA046 
Study Phase: III 
Primary Objective(s):  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of ABI-007 
and gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in improving overall survival in patients with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 
Secondary Objective(s): 
The secondary objectives of this study are to: 

RECIST criteria. 

•  Evaluate the objective tumor response and progression-free survival according to 
•  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination in this patient population. 
•  Evaluate functional tumor response according to EORTC criteria. 
•  Evaluate change in CA19-9 levels. 
•  Evaluate secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in tumor tissue and 

peripheral blood and determine its possible correlation with efficacy outcomes. 

 
Study Design: 
This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, Phase III trial to compare ABI-007 in 
combination with gemcitabine administered weekly to standard treatment (gemcitabine 
monotherapy) with respect to overall survival, objective tumor response rate and PFS in 
patients diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 
Patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment regimens: 
•  ABI-007 125 mg/m2 administered in combination with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly 

for 3 weeks followed by one week of rest 

or 
•  Gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 administered weekly for 7 weeks followed by a week of rest 
(Cycle 1), followed by cycles of weekly administration for 3 weeks followed by a week 
of rest (Cycle 2 onward).

ABI-007 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CA046 
 
 
Study Population:  
630 patients are planned (315 per arm).   
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
ABI-007 plus gemcitabine: ABI-007 125 mg/m2, IV infusion over 30-minute, followed by 
gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion; weekly for 3 weeks (on Days 1, 8, and 
15) followed by a week of rest. 
Gemcitabine alone: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion:  
Cycle 1 - administered weekly for 7 weeks followed by a week of rest.  
Cycle 2 onwards - weekly administration for 3 weeks (on Days 1, 8, and 15) followed by 
a week of rest. 

Duration of Treatment:  
Patients may continue on treatment until they experience progressive disease or unacceptable 
toxicity, require palliative radiotherapy, withdraw consent, or their physician feels it is no 
longer in their best interest to continue on treatment. 
Efficacy Assessments: 
Patients will have CT scans performed every 8 weeks and evaluated by a blinded, centralized 
reading center using the RECIST guidelines for complete response (CR), partial response 
(PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). Functional tumor response will be 
evaluated by PET scans performed every 8 weeks.  CA19-9 response will be assessed by 
radioimmunoassay.   
Safety Assessments: 
Safety and tolerability will be monitored through continuous reporting of adverse events and 
serious adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and incidence of patients experiencing dose 
modifications, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of study drug. 
Statistical Methods:  
All efficacy analyses will be based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population, which includes 
all randomized patients regardless of whether the patient received any study drug or had any 
efficacy assessments collected. The Treated population, which includes all randomized 
patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, will be the analysis population for all 
safety analyses.   

Efficacy Analyses: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival which will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
methods.  Survival will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
death (any cause). Patients who are alive will be censored at the last known time that the 
patient was alive. 
The null (Ho) and alternative (Ha) hypotheses for testing overall survival are:  
Ho: HRABI-007+Gemcitabine/Gemcitabine alone = 1 
Ha: HRABI-007+Gemcitabine/Gemcitabine alone ≠1 (superiority) 
Patient survival will be summarized by median survival time (including 95% CI) for each 
treatment arm along with the hazard ratio (including 95% CI). The Kaplan-Meier curve for 
survival will be presented for each treatment arm and differences in the curves will be tested 
using the stratified log-rank test.  The 1-year survival rate will be summarized.  The final

analysis for survival will be conducted when a total of at least 455 deaths occur. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints (objective tumor response and PFS) will only be evaluated 
if the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrates superiority for ABI-007+gemcitabine over 
gemcitabine alone. 
Safety Analyses 
Toxicities/adverse events (AEs) will be analyzed in terms of treatment-emergent events 
defined to be any event that begins or worsens in grade after the start of study drug through 
30 days after the last dose of study drug. All events will be coded using MedDRA and the 
MedDRA lower level term will be mapped into the appropriate NCI CTCAE term.  The 
incidence of treatment-emergent toxicities by worst grade will be summarized by NCI 
CTCAE term and differences between the treatment arms will be tested using the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test.  AEs also will be summarized by MedDRA system organ class 
and preferred term. 
In order to investigate the maximal degree of myelosuppression, the NCI CTC grade for 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC), white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count, and 
hemoglobin will be summarized by the most severe grade in each treatment cycle and by the 
most severe grade during the study; testing of treatment regimen differences will be 
performed using the CMH test. Hepatic and renal function will be summarized using the 
most severe NCI CTCAE grade for alkaline phosphatase, ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), total 
bilirubin, and creatinine during the first cycle of therapy and for anytime during the study; 
testing of treatment regimen differences will be performed using the CMH test.

1  OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 
1.1  Study Objectives 

1.1.1 

Primary Objective  

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of ABI-007 
and gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in improving overall survival in patients with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 

1.1.2 

Secondary Objective(s)  

The secondary objectives of this study are to: 

RECIST criteria. 

•  Evaluate the objective tumor response and progression-free survival according to 
•  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination in this patient population. 
•  Evaluate functional tumor response according to EORTC criteria. 
•  Evaluate change in CA19-9 levels. 
•  Evaluate secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in tumor tissue and 

peripheral blood and determine its possible correlation with efficacy outcomes. 

 
1.2  Study Endpoints 

1.2.1 

Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  

The primary efficacy endpoint of this study will be the overall survival of patients treated 
with ABI-007 in combination with gemcitabine compared to patients treated with 
gemcitabine alone. 

1.2.2 

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s) 

The secondary efficacy endpoints are: 

•  Objective tumor response based on CT scans (or MRI scans, if patient is allergic to 

contrast agent or has some other contraindication to a CT scan).  These will be 
evaluated according to the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) 
criteria 

•  Progression-free survival 

 
Interpretation of radiological response will be completed by review of CT (or MRI) scans at 
an independent, centralized, blinded facility.

Safety Endpoints 

The safety/tolerability endpoints will be: 

•  Incidence of treatment-emergent toxicities/adverse events (AEs) in terms categorized 
and graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)  

•  Incidence of dose modifications, interruptions, and discontinuations. 

 
2  BACKGROUND  
2.1  Pancreatic Cancer  

In 2008, the estimated number of new cases of pancreatic cancer in the US was 37,680 with 
an estimated 34,290 deaths from the disease.1  At diagnosis, most patients are inoperable and 
present with advanced disease, as a result of the lack of specific symptoms while the disease 
develops.  Patients with advanced disease are usually treated with chemotherapy, with the 
intent of prolonging survival and palliate symptoms (pain, weight loss and decrease in 
performance status).  Median survival time ranges from 4 to 6 months in patients with 
metastatic disease.  Overall, the 5-year survival rate is about 4% for all stages combined and 
decreases to 1.6% for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.  Since 1997, gemcitabine

has become the standard chemotherapy for treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, after 
demonstration in a comparative study between gemcitabine and 5-FU, that gemcitabine 
produced significant improvement in disease-related symptoms and prolonged survival (1-
year survival: 18% versus 2%, respectively) (Burris et al, 1997).2  In that study, median 
survival was 5.65 months for gemcitabine-treated patients and 4.41 months for 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU) treated patients, while overall tumor response, as assessed by RECIST, was 5.4% and 
0%, respectively.   

Abraxis BioScience

Since then, eight Phase III trials of newer cytotoxic or biologic agents combined with 
gemcitabine have not shown any survival improvement compared with gemcitabine alone.  
Only recently (2007) Moore and collaborators reported that the addition to gemcitabine of 
erlotinib, an oral epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibitor, improved median overall survival 
(6.24 months for the doublet vs. 5.91 months for gemcitabine alone), 1-year survival (23% 
vs. 17%, respectively) and progression-free survival (HR 0.77 in favor of the doublet), all 
without a significant difference in objective response rates between the study arms.3  The 
improvements in patient outcomes have thus been rather modest and new solutions are 
therefore needed in advanced pancreatic cancer. 

2.2  Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer with Taxanes 

The taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel have been tested in pancreatic cancer with variable and 
non reproducible results.  Docetaxel has demonstrated variable activity in pancreatic cancer 
with response rates ranging from 0%-28% and reported median survivals of >6 months.4,5,6,7  
Docetaxel has been combined with gemcitabine in multiple studies.  Gemcitabine was given 
weekly at the standard dose of 1,000 mg/m2, and docetaxel doses ranged from 75-100 mg/m2 
every 3 weeks.  Response rates ranged from 7.4%-33%, and the best median survival was 7 
months.8,9  Paclitaxel also has been evaluated as a single agent in metastatic pancreatic 
cancer in a Phase II trial; the response rate was 8% and median survival was 5 months.10 

Recently, a combination that includes gemcitabine plus docetaxel plus capecitabine (GTX) 
was tested by Fine and colleagues.11  The response rate of the combination has been reported 
to be 47% partial response (PR) plus 31% minor response (MR) with activity observed even 
in patients with previous progression on gemcitabine (10% complete response [CR], 20% 
partial response [PR]).  A recent study12 showed increased survival time compared to 
standard therapy in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients 
treated with gemcitabine plus EndoTAG-1, a cationic lipid-complexed paclitaxel particle. 
Therefore, combinations of gemcitabine plus a taxane remain of interest. 

ABI-007 has proven better than paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer in terms 
of response rate and time to progression, with less myelosuppression.  In addition, the 
findings that osteonectin (SPARC) is markedly over-expressed in pancreatic cancer 
specimens, particularly in surrounding fibroblasts and in the extracellular matrix, gives some 
promise that ABI-007 could localize in the tumor, given the involvement of SPARC in the 
delivery of ABI-007 to tumors.13

These facts prompted Von Hoff and collaborators (Von Hoff et al. 2008), to conduct a Phase 
Ib study of ABI-007 plus gemcitabine (Abraxis Study CA040), in which escalating doses of 
weekly ABI-007 were combined with a fixed schedule of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 weekly 
for 3 week followed by a week of rest) in patients with no prior treatment for metastatic 
pancreatic cancer.14  The primary objective of this on-going study is finding the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination, while secondary objectives include the reporting 
of any objective antitumor responses and disease stabilization lasting at least 4 cycles, as well 
as to further characterize the safety and tolerability of the dosing regimen.  Updated results 
(as of October 2008) for the 43 patients enrolled in this study are summarized [41 (95%) of 
patients were treated; 30 (73%) of patients had at least one response assessment]. Patients 
received ABI-007 100 mg/m2 (20 patients), 125 mg/m2 (19 patients), or 150 mg/m2 (2 
patients) in combination with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2. Independent review of the patient’s 
measurable disease on CAT and PET scans is ongoing with many of the patients continuing 
to have radiographic regression of disease. Overall, in 25 patients with Baseline and at least 
one post-Baseline CA-19-9 level recorded, 23 patients (92%) experienced a CA19-9 
reduction of at least 20% (14 patients at 100 mg/m2 and 9 patients at 125 mg/m2) and 16 
patients (64%) experienced a reduction of at least 70% (10 patients at 100 mg/m2 and 6 
patients at 125 mg/m2). A decrease of CA19-9 of at least 20% has been associated with 
improvement in patient survival.15,16,17 Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related AEs (by CTCv3 
criteria) were largely confined to blood/bone marrow categories with neutropenia being the 
highest at 32% and 15%, respectively. There were one Grade 3 and one Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia events. Other non-hematological Grade 3 and 4 AEs included one instance of 
lung infection (Grade 4), one instance of sensory neuropathy (Grade 3), one instance of skin 
urticaria (Grade 3), one instance of systemic infection (Grade 3), one instance of 
hypoalbuminemia (Grade 3), and 4 instances of diarrhea (Grade 3). The remainder of 
toxicities were confined to Grade 1 or 2. There were 3 treatment-emergent AEs resulting in 
death (lung infection, systemic infection, and gastrointestinal obstruction), but only systemic 
infection was considered treatment-related.   

At the present time, the trial is nearing completion, an MTD of 125 mg/m2 ABI-007 + 1000 
mg/m2 gemcitabine has been identified, and an expanded cohort is being treated at this dose 
level.14 

The unusual activity of the ABI-007 and gemcitabine combination may be related to the 
over-expression of SPARC in pancreatic cancer.  SPARC mediates ABI-007 delivery at 
tumor sites.  Since SPARC does not mediate gemcitabine delivery to tumors, it is expected 
that the combination of ABI-007 and gemcitabine will be superior to gemcitabine alone in 
survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.  This proposed Phase III study will also 
explore the correlation of the expression of SPARC and other biomarkers with clinical 
outcomes. 

2.3  Response Assessments in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer 

Unlike other solid tumors, where imaging provides an accurate and reliable means to assess 
tumor size, pancreatic cancer poses difficulties in lesion measurements and response 
assessments due to the desmoplastic component of its lesions, which make unequivocal 

Confidential

Clinical Trial Protocol: CA046 
 
 
measurements challenging.  If the lesion is mostly desmoplastic, successful therapy can result 
in minimal change in measurement.18  For this reason, there is increasing interest in 
identifying alternative endpoints with which to evaluate effective therapy.  A biological 
marker widely used in clinical practice in the assessment and follow-up of patients with 
pancreatic cancer is the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9).  Serial measurements of CA19-
9 are frequently performed for prognostic purposes, for gauging disease relapse and activity, 
and for monitoring patients undergoing therapy as an approximate surrogate for response.  
The use of CA19-9 biomarker as a primary endpoint in clinical trial design has not been 
universally established.  However, a strong correlation between marker decline during 
chemotherapy and patient outcomes has been observed,15,16,17 and a recommendation has 
been made to entertain the use of this biomarker as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials of 
new treatments in pancreatic cancer.15  The remarkable CA19-9 decreases seen in the CA040 
study (Von Hoff et al, 2008) justify the evaluation of changes in this biomarker in this 
proposed Phase III study as a surrogate indicator for efficacy.  It will be explored as part of 
its secondary endpoints and correlated with efficacy outcomes.    

2.4  ABI-007: Paclitaxel Albumin-bound Particles 

2.4.1 

The Product 

ABI-007 is a Cremophor EL-free, albumin-bound paclitaxel particle with a mean size of 
approximately 130 nm.  Each 50 mL vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel, and approximately 
900 mg of human albumin, as a white to yellow sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution 
with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. 

2.4.2 

Introduction 

ABI-007 is a unique protein formulation of a non-crystalline, amorphous form of paclitaxel 
in an insoluble particle state.  ABI-007 has been developed to reduce the toxicities associated 
with Taxol (paclitaxel) Injection (in which paclitaxel - from the native crystalline form - is in 
solution with Cremophor EL/ethanol as the solvent) while maintaining or improving its 
chemotherapeutic effect.  ABI-007 has been approved in the US, Canada, India, the EU, 
Korea and China (and is under review in a number of other countries) for the treatment of 
women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).  ABI-007 alone and in combination is being 
evaluated in a number of cancers including: metastatic melanoma, pancreatic cancer, cervical 
cancer and other solid tumors.  Conditions which are responsive to paclitaxel such as non-
hematological solid tumor malignancies are good clinical candidates for treatment with 
ABI-007. 

2.4.3 

Preclinical Studies with ABI-007  

A range of preclinical studies in the appropriate species have been completed with ABI-007 
including single and repeat-dose toxicity studies, carcinogenicity evaluations, reproductive 
toxicity assessments, and mutagenicity and toxicity studies.  A thorough discussion of these 
is included in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).   

Confidential

Preclinical studies comparing ABI-007 to Taxol demonstrated lower toxicities, with a MTD 
approximately 50% higher for ABI-007 compared to Taxol.  At equitoxic doses of paclitaxel, 
ABI-007 was found to be markedly more efficacious in these animal models than Taxol.19

2.4.4 

Clinical Studies with ABI-007 

In an on-going study of ABI-007 in combination with gemcitabine administered weekly 
(Abraxis Protocol CA040; updated results as of October 2008), a total of 41 patients with 
advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer were treated with doses ranging from 100 to 
150 mg/m2.  Though results are preliminary and follow-up is on-going, 27 patients (66%) 
experienced at least 1 treatment-related AE and 11 (27%) patients experienced at least one 
treatment-emergent SAE.  With the exception of the “Gastrointestinal: Dehydration”, “not 
classified” and “pain: other” categories (2 (5%) events each), no treatment-emergent SAE 
categories had more than a single event. 

Dose delays were mainly due to blood/bone marrow treatment-related AEs (mostly 
neutrophils). There were no ABI-007 dose interruptions due to treatment-related AEs, and 2 
instances of dose interruptions for gemcitabine (dermatology/skin: injection site reaction).  
Also, 2 patients had a total of 3 treatment-related AEs involving blood/bone marrow 
(neutrophils and platelets) resulting in dose reductions and 2 treatment-related AE resulted in 
dose discontinuation (gastrointestinal: diarrhea and infection: systemic).  There were 3 
treatment-emergent AEs resulting in death (lung infection, systemic infection, and 
gastrointestinal obstruction), but only systemic infection was considered treatment-related.  
Patients treated with ABI-007 in combination with gemcitabine had levels of 
myelosuppression consistent with those expected following treatment with taxanes.   

2.4.5 

Potential Risks of ABI-007 

ABI-007 is not formulated in Cremophor and thus the risk of hypersensitivity reactions is 
much less than that of Taxol.  The major risks of ABI-007 have been assessed in clinical 
trials in patients with a variety of malignances and reflect the known toxicities of paclitaxel.  
See the IB for a complete description of all toxicities reported in conjunction with ABI-007 
administration. 

The most common toxicities reported in previous clinical trials included: 

•  Myelosuppression, predominantly neutropenia. Grade 4 neutropenia was reported and 
typically resolved in < 7 days and did not require colony stimulating factor support. 
•  Peripheral neuropathy, predominantly sensory.  Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 
reported and typically improved to Grade 1 or 2 within 21 days of interrupting the 
ABI-007 dose.  Following resolution of the peripheral neuropathy to acceptable 
levels, clinicians were able to restart ABI-007 dosing at a lower dose levels. 

•  Nausea and vomiting.  Nausea and vomiting were seen, typically at Grade 1 or 2 

levels.  This AE responded well to standard anti-emetic regimens.

•  Myalgias and arthralgias.  Myalgias and arthralgias were reported and typically were 

 
 
 

Grade 1 or 2; these were responsive to standard acetaminophen-containing 
medication. 

•  Mucositis.  Mucositis was reported typically Grade 1 or 2. It was not dose limiting. 
•  Alopecia.  Alopecia was reported by most patients and was similar to that seen with 

Taxol. 

 
2.4.6 

Potential Risks of Gemcitabine 

The most common toxicities reported for gemcitabine are: 

•  Hematologic — In studies in pancreatic cancer, myelosuppression is the dose-limiting 

toxicity with Gemzar®, but <1% of patients discontinued therapy for either anemia, 
leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Red blood cell transfusions were required by 19% 
of patients. The incidence of sepsis was less than 1%. Petechiae or mild blood loss 
(hemorrhage), from any cause, was reported in 16% of patients; less than 1% of 
patients required platelet transfusions. Patients should be monitored for 
myelosuppression during Gemzar therapy and dosage modified or suspended 
according to the degree of hematologic toxicity  

•  Gastrointestinal — Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported (69%) but were 
usually of mild to moderate severity. Severe nausea and vomiting (WHO Grade 3/4) 
occurred in <15% of patients. Diarrhea was reported by 19% of patients, and 
stomatitis by 11% of patients.  

•  Hepatic — In clinical trials, Gemzar was associated with transient elevations of one 

or both serum transaminases in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no 
evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either longer duration of exposure to 
Gemzar or with greater total cumulative dose. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver 
failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving Gemzar.  

•  Renal — In clinical trials, mild proteinuria and hematuria were commonly reported. 
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) has been reported rarely (0.25%) with the use of 
Gemzar. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy and 
dialysis may be required. 

•  Fever — The overall incidence of fever was 41%. This is in contrast to the incidence 

of infection (16%) and indicates that Gemzar may cause fever in the absence of 
clinical infection. Fever was frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms and 
was usually mild and clinically manageable.  

•  Rash — Rash was reported in 30% of patients. The rash was typically a macular or 

finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption of mild to moderate severity 
involving the trunk and extremities. Pruritus was reported for 13% of patients.  

•  Pulmonary — In clinical trials, dyspnea, unrelated to underlying disease, has been 

reported in association with Gemzar therapy. Dyspnea was occasionally accompanied 
by bronchospasm. Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of Gemzar. The 
etiology of these effects is unknown. If such effects develop, Gemzar should be

conditions.  

were reported. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema.  

•  Edema — Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%) 
•  Flu-like Symptoms — “Flu syndrome” was reported for 19% of patients. Individual 
symptoms of fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia were 
commonly reported. Fever and asthenia were also reported frequently as isolated 
symptoms. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and malaise were reported infrequently. Less 
than 1% of patients discontinued due to flu-like symptoms.  

•  Infection — Infections were reported for 16% of patients. Sepsis was rarely reported.  
•  Alopecia — Hair loss, usually minimal, was reported by 15% of patients.  
•  Neurotoxicity — There was a 10% incidence of mild paresthesias and a <1% rate of 

severe paresthesias.

3.3  Other Study Eligibility Criteria Considerations 

To assess any potential impact on patient eligibility with regard to safety, the Investigator 
must refer to the relevant document(s) for detailed information regarding warnings, 
precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other significant data pertaining to the 
study drug being used in this study.  Such documents may include, but are not limited to the 
IB, or equivalent document provided by Abraxis, and the Abraxane and gemcitabine 
prescribing information (current versions of Prescribing Information are provided in the 
Study Manual).  
4  STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 
4.1  Study Design 

This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, Phase III trial to compare ABI-007 in 
combination with gemcitabine administered weekly to standard treatment (gemcitabine 
monotherapy) with respect to improve overall survival and objective tumor response rate in 
patients diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  Six hundred thirty 
patients (315 per arm) will be randomized to each treatment regimen in a 1:1 ratio. 

The study will consist of the following visits (See Time and Events Schedule: Table 6):   
•  Baseline Assessments: To be performed within 28 days of randomization.   
•  Randomization: Patients will be randomized within 28 days of starting their Baseline 
assessments. To ensure that on-study tumor response assessments are conducted at

12 November 2008  
 

comparable time points from randomization, all patients must begin treatment within 7 
days after randomization. 
•  Response Assessments:  Patients will be evaluated for complete response (CR), partial 
response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) based on blinded, central 
review of CT scans performed every 8 weeks.  Response will be evaluated using RECIST 
criteria.  In addition, PET scans will be completed every 8 weeks.  These scans will also 
be reviewed by a blinded central laboratory using the EORTC criteria.   
Responders and stable disease patients may continue on study unless they develop an 
unacceptable toxicity.  Progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity will be the criteria for 
treatment failure and discontinuation from the study.  Patients who have not had 
progression of their cancer should continue to be followed with regularly scheduled 
tumor assessments with radiographic imaging until progressive disease is documented. 

•  End-of-Study (EOS) Evaluation:  At the time patients are removed from study, 
laboratory and clinical evaluations to assess AEs and other study measures will be 
performed.  Radiologic studies for antitumor response will be repeated only if required 
per the defined study imaging schedule. 

•  Adverse Event Collection and Follow-up:  Any AE that started after initial study drug 
administration and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or EOS (whichever is 
later) will be collected. Adverse events will be followed as outlined in Section 7.8. 

•  Follow-up for disease progression: Patients who are discontinued from treatment in the 

absence of disease progression (e.g., patients removed for unacceptable toxicity) will 
undergo repeat imaging and tumor response assessments every 8 weeks (at any time 
during that week), regardless of regimen, until disease progression is documented. It is 
recommended that subsequent therapy not be instituted until disease progression is 
documented. 

•  Follow-up for overall survival:  Post-study, overall survival status will be monitored on 
a monthly basis for 6 months and every 3 months thereafter, for a total of 2 years.  This 
evaluation may be by record review and/or telephone contact with the patients’ treating 
physician.

Evaluation of Molecular Biomarkers 

4.1.1.1 

Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) 

Biomarkers, such as secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich (SPARC; also known as 
osteonectin, or BM40), is an albumin-binding protein that is secreted by approximately 50% 
of all breast cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis in the clinic. Albumin-binding 
proteins such as SPARC may result in the concentration of albumin-bound drugs, such as 
ABI-007, in the area of tumor and may be partly responsible for the greater activity of ABI-
007 compared to other non-albumin-bound formulations used to treat solid tumors.19 Because 
of the high response rates previously observed in breast20 and pancreatic14,21 cancer patients 
treated with ABI-007, tumor samples will be collected from patients in order to obtain data 
on a potential correlation between SPARC protein expression and response to ABI-007 
therapy.

A biological marker widely used in clinical practice is the assessment and follow-up of 
patients with pancreatic cancer is the CA19-9.  The use of this biomarker as a primary 
endpoint in clinical trial design has not been universally established.  However, a strong 
correlation between marker decline during chemotherapy and patient outcomes has been 
observed, particularly in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.  For example, in an on-
going study of ABI-007 in combination with gemcitabine for advanced adenocarcinoma of 
the pancreas (Abraxis BioScience Protocol CA040), remarkable decreases of CA 19-9 were 
observed.  In this trial, serial measurements of CA19-9 will be performed for prognostic 
purposes, for gauging disease relapse and activity, and for monitoring patients undergoing 
therapy as an approximate surrogate for response.  These measurements may serve as a 
surrogate endpoint in this clinical trial and establish the validity of CA 19-9 as a valid 
endpoint for assessment of antitumor activity in future clinical trials of new treatments in 
pancreatic cancer.  Because CA19-9 is being used only in an exploratory analysis of 
efficacy, in this study increases in CA19-9 levels should not be used as evidence for 
progressive disease or for removing patients from study.  

4.2  Study Chemotherapy Administration 

4.2.1 

ABI-007 Premedication 

Patients do not require premedication prior to ABI-007 administration, as hypersensitivity 
reactions are not expected, though initial antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended due to 
administration of gemcitabine following ABI-007 treatment.  

If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the infusion should be stopped and not restarted.  If felt 
to be in the patient’s best interests, at the investigator’s discretion, treatment may continue on 
subsequent cycles using the premedication regimen the institution typically uses for Taxol. 

4.2.2  Gemcitabine Premedication 

Initial antiemetic prophylaxis for both arms is recommended with a 5HT3 agent (PO or IV) 
in combination with dexamethasone 8 or 10 mg (PO or IV) prior to administration of 
gemcitabine in either arm. Dexamethasone may be continued at the dose of 4 mg bid or tid 
for 3-4 days after chemotherapy at the investigator’s discretion. If a patient experiences 
nausea and/ or vomiting following the first dose, then ASCO and/or institutional guidelines 
should be followed for breakthrough antiemetic management. 

4.2.3 

Chemotherapy Dose 

The cycle length is 8 weeks during Cycle 1, and 4 weeks from Cycle 2 onward.  Treatment 
with protocol therapy will continue until one or more of the criteria listed in Section 4.4 are 
met.

4.2.3.1 

Regimen 

Patients will be treated on an outpatient basis with ABI-007 plus gemcitabine or gemcitabine 
alone.  
Patients receiving ABI-007+gemcitabine will receive 125 mg/m2 ABI-007 as a 30-minute 
infusion followed by 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine as a 30-minute infusion for 3 weeks (on Days 
1, 8, and 15) followed by a week of rest. 
Patients receiving gemcitabine alone will receive 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine as a 30-minute 
infusion administered weekly for 7 weeks followed by a week of rest (8-week cycle; Cycle 1 
only), followed by cycles of weekly administration for 3 weeks (on Days 1, 8, and 15)  
followed by one week of rest (4-week cycle). 
Supportive care per the institution’s normal standard of care can be provided at the 
Investigator’s discretion (see Section 4.3). 

4.2.3.2 

Rules for Dose Omissions and Modified Schedules1 

Day 1 dose missed: 

If the dose held or missed was to be given on Day 1 of the next cycle, that next cycle will not 
be considered to start until the day the first dose is actually administered to the patient (i.e., 
1-2-3-Rest, X-1-2-3-Rest, etc.) 

Day 8 dose is missed: 

Cycle continues per protocol, with one dose not given (i.e., 1-2-3-Rest, 1-X-3-Rest, 1-2-3-
Rest, etc.). Day 15 is administered as per cycle calendar if counts and chemistries permit. 

                                                 

1 These rules do not apply to the first course of treatment. Refer to Table 3 for dose modifications during the 
first course of treatment.

Day 15 dose missed: 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

That week becomes the week of rest.  Next dose (if counts and chemistries permit) becomes 
Day 1 of a new cycle, and the patient is considered to have had a x2q3 (21-day) cycle (i.e., 
1-2-3-Rest, 1-2-X, 1-2-3-Rest, etc). 

4.2.3.3 

Administration of Study Drug to Patients with Abnormal Hepatic Function  

Study drug should only be administered if hepatic function is within the parameters 
established in the eligibility criteria.  Hepatic toxicity from taxanes may occur but it is 
uncommon.  Therefore, hepatic dysfunction that occurs while the patient is on study should 
prompt an evaluation to determine the cause, including the possibility of progressive 
metastatic disease and hepatotoxicity from concurrent medications. 

4.2.3.4 

Dose Modification Tables 

Doses will be reduced for hematologic and other toxicities.  Dose adjustments are to be made 
according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity.  Toxicities will be graded 
using the NCI CTCAE Version 3.0.  

Patients experiencing study drug-related toxicities that require a delay in scheduled ABI-007 
and gemcitabine dosing for ≥ 14 days will be discontinued from further participation in this 
study.  When a dose reduction is required for Day 1 of any cycle, no dose re-escalation will 
be permitted for the duration of study treatment. 

DOSE MODIFICATIONS AT DAY 1 

In the event dose modifications are required at the beginning of a cycle due to AEs or 
hematologic toxicities, doses of ABI-007 and gemcitabine may be adjusted as detailed in  

Table 2 and Table 3 below:

This decision as to which drug should be modified will depend upon the type of non-hematologic toxicity 
seen and which course is medically most sound in the judgment of the physician/investigator.  Treatment 
may be reinstated on Day 1 of the next cycle. 

 
4.2.3.4.1  PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY   

Treatment should be withheld in patients who experience ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy.  
Treatment may be resumed at the next lower dose level (20% reduction of ABI-007) in 
subsequent cycles after the peripheral neuropathy improves to ≤ Grade 1. The time to 
resolution to Grade ≤ 1 should be the adverse event duration used for adverse event 
reporting. 

4.2.3.4.2  CUTANEOUS TOXICITY 

Patients who develop Grade 2 or 3 cutaneous toxicity should have their dose reduced to the 
next lower dose level (20% reduction of both drugs). If the patient continues to experience 
these reactions, despite dose reduction, treatment should be discontinued. Patients who 
develop Grade 4 cutaneous toxicity should have treatment discontinued. 

4.2.3.4.3  GASTROINTESTINAL TOXICITY 

If Grade 3 mucositis or diarrhea occurs, study drug should be withheld until resolution to 
≤ Grade 1, then reinstituted at the next lower dose level (20% reduction of both drugs). 
Patients who develop Grade 4 mucositis or diarrhea should have treatment discontinued. 

4.2.3.4.4  COLONY STIMULATING FACTOR ADMINISTRATION 

Colony stimulating factors may be given according to institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of neutropenic fever or infections associated with neutropenia. 

4.2.3.5 

Hypersensitivity Reactions 

Hypersensitivity reactions are not expected with either ABI-007 or gemcitabine. If they do 
occur, minor symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, hypotension, or 
tachycardia may require temporary interruption of the infusion. However, severe reactions, 
such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema, or 
generalized urticaria require immediate discontinuation of study drug administration and 
aggressive symptomatic therapy. 

Confidential 
 

Page 28

Patients who develop a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ABI-007 should not be 
re-challenged. 
4.3  Concomitant Medications 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

Over the course of this trial, additional medications may be required to manage aspects of the 
disease state of the patients, including side effects from trial treatments or disease 
progression.  Supportive care, including but not limited to anti-emetic medications, may be 
administered at the discretion of the Investigator.  Irradiation is not allowed during the study.  
Administration of other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or anti-tumor hormonal therapy 
during the study is not allowed.  All concomitant treatments, including blood and blood 
products, must be reported on the case report form.  Erythropoietin may be administered at 
the discretion of the Investigator, consistent with institutional guidelines.  G-CSF should be 
administered according to institutional guidelines. 

4.4  Discontinuation 

A patient may voluntarily discontinue study participation at any time. The Investigator may 
also, at his/her discretion, discontinue the patient's study participation at any time. In the 
event of discontinuation, the patient should return to the study site as soon as feasible to have 
the EOS assessments performed and the appropriate follow-up evaluations should occur. 
Patients must be withdrawn from this study if any of the following occurs: 
•  Progressive disease. 
•  Development of toxicity that is unacceptable in the opinion of the Investigator. 
•  Patient declines to continue therapy (i.e., withdraws consent). 
•  If following the 2nd dose reduction there is a recurrence of Grade 4 neutropenia, or any 

other hematologic toxicity that is Grade 3 or 4, or any Grade 3 or 4 non-
myelosuppressive adverse event, unless, at the discretion of the Investigator, there is 
evidence of continuing benefit to the patient that outweighs the risk of recurrent toxicity.  

•  Initiation of other anticancer therapy. 
•  In the Investigator’s judgment, it is in the patient’s best interest to discontinue the study. 
 
Patients who are withdrawn from the study secondary to a laboratory abnormality or adverse 
event should be followed as outlined in Section 6.9. 
5  STUDY DRUG MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION  
5.1  ABI-007 

5.1.1 

Packaging, Labeling, and Storage of Study Drug 

ABI-007 will be supplied by the sponsor, Abraxis BioScience (Abraxis), in single-use vials. 
Each single-use 50 mL vial will contain paclitaxel (100 mg) and approximately 900 mg 
human albumin (HA) as a stabilizer.  Each vial will be labeled according to country-specific 
regulatory requirements for labeling of investigational products.  Unreconstituted ABI-007 

Confidential 
 

Page 29 

 
 
 

ABI-007 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CA046 
 
 
should be stored at controlled room temperature (25°C or 77°F; excursions permitted to 15-
30ºC [See USP controlled room temperature]).  Reconstituted ABI-007 should be used 
immediately.  If not used immediately, the vial of reconstituted ABI-007 must be placed in 
its carton and be placed in a refrigerator at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for a maximum of 8 hours.  
Both forms should be stored in an area free of environmental extremes and must be 
accessible only to study personnel.  

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

Temperature records for ABI-007 must be made available to the Abraxis or other sponsor-
nominated monitoring teams for verification of proper study drug storage. 

Only completely unused study drug vials should be retained by the site until a representative 
from Abraxis or other Abraxis-designated personnel have completed an inventory.  Partially 
used and completely used vials should be destroyed according to the site’s guidelines, and 
their disposition should be recorded on the Investigational Drug Accountability Record 
Form. 

The Investigator, or designee, shall record the dispensing of study drug to patients in a study 
drug accountability record.  The study drug record will be made available to Abraxis, or 
other authorized Abraxis-designated monitoring personnel for the purpose of accounting for 
the study drug supply.  Inspections of the study drug supply for inventory purposes and 
assurance of proper storage will be conducted as necessary.  Any significant discrepancy will 
be recorded and reported to Abraxis or their designee and a plan for resolution will be 
documented. 

Study drugs will not be loaned or dispensed by the Investigator to another Investigator or 
site. 

5.1.2 

Study Medication Administration 

NOTE: It is not a requirement to use filter needles in the preparation of, or in-line 
filters during the administration of ABI-007. In any event, filters of pore-size less than 
15 micrometers must not be used. 

ABI-007 will be reconstituted by appropriate study personnel and administered to the patient 
at the study site.  The Investigator will calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient in 
order to determine the total amount of paclitaxel to be administered. 

Reconstitution and use of ABI-007: 

1.  Calculate the patient’s BSA according to standard institutional methods.  BSA will be 
calculated at Baseline and recalculated only if body weight changes by more than 10%. 
Dosing BSA may be capped if the treating physician believes it is in the best interest of 
an obese patient. 

2.  Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by:  
 
 

  Total Dose (mg) = BSA x (study dose mg/m2 )

100 (mg/vial) 
  Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number when a

fractional number of vials is obtained by the above formula (e.g., if the total number of 
vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be reconstituted).  

4.  Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution. 
5.  Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol. 
6.  Reconstitute each ABI-007 vial by using a 50 or 60 cc sterile syringe to inject 20 mL of 

0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or equivalent into each vial over a period of not less than 
1 minute (Note: Change the syringes after reconstituting every 3 vials).  

◦  Slowly inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, over a minimum of 1 
minute, using the sterile syringe directing the solution flow onto the inside wall of 
the vial. 

◦  DO NOT INJECT the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection solution directly onto the 

lyophilized cake as this will result in foaming. 

◦  Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 minutes 

to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.   

◦  Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete 

dissolution of any cake/powder occurs.  Avoid generation of foam. 
If foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam 
subsides. 

◦ 

◦  Each mL of reconstituted product will contain 5 mg of paclitaxel. 

7.  Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/mL suspension required for the patient: 
 
8.  The reconstituted sample should be milky and homogeneous without visible particulates.  

  Dosing volume (mL) = Total dose (mg) / 5 (mg/mL) 

If unsuspended powder is visible, the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure 
complete resuspension, prior to use. 

9.  Use immediately following reconstitution.  If not used immediately, replace the 

reconstituted vial in the carton and store reconstituted ABI-007 in a refrigerator for not 
more than 8 hours. 

10. Using a new, sterile 50 or 60 cc syringe, withdraw the reconstituted ABI-007 solution.  
Do not remove the rubber stopper from the ABI-007 vials as this can compromise the 
sterility of the drug preparation. 

11. Inject the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABI-007 suspension into an empty 

sterile, standard PVC IV bag, using an injection port. Inject perpendicularly into the 
center of the injection port to avoid dislodging plastic material into the IV bag.  Repeat 
steps 9 and 10 until the patient’s entire required dose is injected into the IV bag. 

12. Remove the injection port.

13. Once the exact volume of reconstituted ABI-007 has been withdrawn from the vials, 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

 
 
 

discard any excess solution left over in accordance with standard operating procedures 
for cytotoxic drugs. 

14. Administer the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABI-007 suspension by IV 

infusion over 30 minutes.  The use of in-line filters is not necessary; if used, in-line filters 
with pore sizes of < 15 microns (15 µm) should not be used. 

 

5.1.3 

Receipt and Return of Study Drug  

Upon receipt of the study drug supplies, the Investigator or designee will conduct an 
inventory and sign both copies of the study drug receipt and forward one copy to the address 
indicated on the form.  One copy of the receipt and the packing slip must be retained in the 
Investigator's regulatory file records. 

A representative from Abraxis or his/her designee will inspect the study drug inventory, and 
will arrange for the return of any remaining unused study drug.  No study drug may be 
returned without the representative from Abraxis or other Abraxis-designated personnel first 
inspecting the study drug inventory. 

Study drug may be destroyed according to the institutional policy of study sites.  An Abraxis 
designee must conduct drug accountability at the site prior to destruction of unused vials.  A 
copy of the site’s drug destruction policy should be provided to the CRA for placement in the 
Abraxis file. 

5.2  Gemcitabine  

5.2.1 

Description 

For complete details on drug administration, storage, clinical pharmacology, and the human 
pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine, please see the gemcitabine package insert (current version 
of Prescribing Information is provided in the Study Manual).  

5.2.2 

Formulation 

Gemcitabine (difluorodeoxycytidine) is a pyrimidine antimetabolite, which is an analogue of 
deoxycytidine.  It was initially synthesized as a potential antiviral drug but selected for 
anticancer development because of its activity in in-vivo and in vitro tumors.  Gemcitabine 
is approved for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer and will be obtained 
commercially.  Gemcitabine should be stored, reconstituted and administered according to 
the manufacturer’s recommendation.  

5.2.3 

Instructions for Storing Gemcitabine 

Store at controlled room temperature (20° to 25°C) (68° to 77°F).  The USP has defined 
controlled room temperature as “A temperature maintained thermostatically that 
encompasses the usual and customary working environment of 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); 

Confidential 
 

Page 32

that results in a mean kinetic temperature calculated to be not more than 25°C; and that 
allows for excursions between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F) that are experienced in 
pharmacies, hospitals, and warehouses.”

5.2.4 

Preparation and Administration 

Preparation and administration of gemcitabine should be per the gemcitabine package insert 
(current version of Prescribing Information is provided in the Study Manual). 

5.2.5 

Instructions for Use/Handling of Gemcitabine  

The recommended diluent for reconstitution of gemcitabine is 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection without preservatives.  Due to solubility considerations, the maximum 
concentration for gemcitabine upon reconstitution is 40 mg/mL.  Reconstitution at 
concentrations greater than 40 mg/mL may result in incomplete dissolution, and should be 
avoided.  

To reconstitute, add 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to the 200-mg vial or 25 mL of 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to the 1-g vial. Shake to dissolve.  These dilutions each 
yield a gemcitabine concentration of 38 mg/mL which includes accounting for the 
displacement volume of the lyophilized powder (0.26 mL for the 200-mg vial or 1.3 mL for 
the 1-g vial).  The total volume upon reconstitution will be 5.26 mL or 26.3 mL, respectively. 
Complete withdrawal of the vial contents will provide 200 mg or 1 g of gemcitabine, 
respectively.  The appropriate amount of drug may be administered as prepared or further 
diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/mL.  

Reconstituted gemcitabine is a clear, colorless to light straw-colored solution.  After 
reconstitution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, the pH of the resulting solution lies in 
the range of 2.7 to 3.3.  The solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration, prior to administration, whenever solution or container permits.  If particulate 
matter or discoloration is found, do not administer.  

When prepared as directed, gemcitabine solutions are stable for 24 hours at controlled room 
temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP].  Discard unused portion.  Solutions of 
reconstituted gemcitabine should not be refrigerated, as crystallization may occur.  

The compatibility of gemcitabine with other drugs has not been studied.  No incompatibilities 
have been observed with infusion bottles or polyvinyl chloride bags and administration sets.  

Unopened vials of gemcitabine are stable until the expiration date indicated on the package 
when stored at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP].

Clinical Trial Protocol: CA046 
 
 
Gemcitabine can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia and anemia, and myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. 
Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy.  Hemolytic-Uremic 
Syndrome (HUS) has been reported rarely with the use of gemcitabine.  Gemcitabine is a 
Pregnancy Category D drug.  Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman.  Gemcitabine is embryotoxic causing fetal malformations (cleft palate, 
incomplete ossification) at doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day in mice (about 1/200 the recommended 
human dose on a mg/m2 basis).  Gemcitabine is fetotoxic causing fetal malformations (fused 
pulmonary artery, absence of gall bladder) at doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day in rabbits (about 1/600 
the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis).  Embryotoxicity was characterized by 
decreased fetal viability, reduced live litter sizes, and developmental delays.  There are no 
studies of gemcitabine in pregnant women.  If gemcitabine is used during pregnancy, or if the 
patient becomes pregnant while taking gemcitabine, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus.  
6  MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATIONS 
6.1  General Considerations 

Informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedures being performed, including 
the washout period for any patient who is engaged in the washout for the sole purpose of 
possible inclusion into this trial.  Each participant will be given a copy of the signed ICF.  
The ICF must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) 
and by an Abraxis or other sponsor-nominated representative. 

A complete medical history (including specific information regarding any prior 
anthracycline-related cardiac abnormality) and physical examination will be conducted on 
each patient for a review of systems and determination of any concurrent symptoms or 
conditions prior to the first dose of study drug. 

Routine study evaluations will be conducted to monitor for existing adverse events and the 
development of new adverse events.  Study site personnel will ask patients the following 
questions: 
•  Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last study visit? 
•  Have you taken any new prescribed or over-the-counter medicines or herbal/vitamin 
preparations, other than those given to you for this study, since your last study visit? 
•  Have any new procedures been performed since your last study visit? 
 
In addition, patients are to be encouraged to call the site to report any unexpected symptoms 
or problems they encounter between study visits. 

Medical symptoms or conditions present at or before study drug administration that manifest 
with the same intensity or frequency subsequent to study drug administration do not need to 
be recorded as adverse events in the CRF.  However, any pre-existing condition that presents 
with increased intensity or increased frequency following study drug administration, or any

exacerbation of an event that is present at the time of study drug administration, should be 
considered an adverse event.  All adverse events occurring from initial dosing through study 
end, inclusive, should be followed as outlined in Section 6.9.  All adverse events must be 
completely and promptly recorded in the patient's source document (e.g., patient hospital 
records, patient clinic charts, and laboratory reports) and on the CRF (see Section 9.3.5).  
Note that individual signs/symptoms should not be recorded in the CRF as adverse events.  If 
a unifying diagnosis is known, it is the diagnosis that should be recorded as the adverse 
event. 

Abraxis BioScience

Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities present at the Baseline visit will be recorded 
as pretreatment signs and symptoms.  After study treatment administration, laboratory 
abnormalities will not be recorded as adverse events unless considered clinically significant 
by the Investigator, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will not be recorded as 
serious adverse events unless the event meets the definition of serious. 

Each Investigator is responsible for assessing the clinical significance of all abnormal 
laboratory values using the NCI CTCAE Scale version 3.0 (see 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html), where applicable.  It is also the responsibility of 
the Investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal laboratory values as 
defined by the list of normal values provided by the local laboratory.  All abnormal 
laboratory tests that are judged to be at least possibly drug related, or clinically relevant 
abnormal laboratory tests of uncertain causality, must be repeated.  Any abnormal values that 
persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. In some cases, significant 
changes within the range of normal values will require similar judgment. 

6.2  Central Laboratory and Central Imaging 

Central laboratory, central imaging, and central SPARC and other molecular biomarkers 
testing will be utilized for this study.  

A central imaging reviewer blinded to treatment will provide an independent review of 
response and progression for all patients enrolled into the study.  Prospective collection of all 
on-study scans for all patients enrolled in the study will be included as part of the review.  
Films or electronic copies should be collected by the investigative sites and sent to the central 
image reader within 2 weeks of completion of the exam.  Complete details regarding image 
handling and submission can be found in the Radiology Technical Manual and Study 
Manual. 

Patients who are discontinued from treatment in the absence of disease progression (e.g., 
patients removed for unacceptable toxicity or patient/investigator discretion) should undergo 
repeat imaging and tumor response assessments until disease progression is documented. 
Imaging studies should be done every 8 weeks (at any time during that week), regardless of 
regimen. 

Sites will be required to use the designated central lab for the study.  Specific instructions 
regarding specimen collection and handling may be found in the Central Lab Manual.

E MRI is acceptable if patient is allergic to contrast agent.  CT scan of the thorax/liver/abdomen and any other studies required for tumor imaging will be performed 
at Baseline, and every 8 weeks (at any time during that week) regardless of regimen, and EOS. If a positive CT of thorax is performed or available at Baseline, then 
it is not necessary to perform a chest x-ray. Whichever method of assessment is chosen at Baseline to follow tumors should remain consistent throughout study 
duration. See Section 6.10 for post-study follow-up. 
F PET scan for SUV at Baseline, and every 8 weeks. 
G In order to keep cycle numbers similar between the 2 arms, Cycle 1 in the gemcitabine-only arm will include weekly dosing for 7 weeks followed by a rest week, 
and Cycle 1 in the ABI-007/gencitabine arm will be comprised of two 4-week cycles (total of 8 weeks). After Cycle 1, both arms receive 3 weeks of weekly drug 
administration followed by 1 week of rest.

Baseline evaluations will be performed for all patients to determine study eligibility.  These 
evaluations must be completed within 28±7 days of randomization (see Section 6.5). Any 
questions regarding patient eligibility should be directed to the Abraxis or other sponsor-
nominated Project Manager or designee for written approval.

The following clinical evaluations will be performed at Baseline after informed consent has 
been obtained: 
•  Medical history (including specific information regarding any prior therapy and cardiac 
•  Physical examination; 
•  Height and weight assessment; 
•  BSA calculations; 
•  Urinalysis; 
•  Prior medication evaluation; 
•  Vital signs; 
•  KPS performance status scale; 
•  Serum β-HCG pregnancy test (for women of childbearing-potential only) will be 
conducted within 72-hours prior to first study drug administration (negative results

•  CT scan (or MRI if patient is allergic to contrast agent); 
•  Serum CA19-9; 
•  Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment; 
•  PET scan; 
•  Consent to use diagnostic tumor biopsy (archival tissue) for SPARC analysis (optional). 
 
The Investigator will account for all patients who are screened for this study.  Although 
CRFs will not be completed for patients who fail screening, source documents will be 
reviewed by the Abraxis or other sponsor-designated study monitor for completion and 
accuracy.  All appropriate CRF pages must be completed for enrolled patients.

6.5  Randomization and Treatment Phase Evaluations 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

All Baseline testing must be completed within 28 days of randomization. Following 
completion of Baseline testing, patients will be randomized. Patients should return within 7 
days to begin Cycle 1 of study drug dosing. Unless otherwise specified, visits where response 
assessments are not performed must occur within ± 2 days of the planned visit date. 
Response assessments CT scans should be performed every 8 weeks (at any time during that 
week) and PET scans should be performed at Baseline and every 8 weeks. Exceptions are 
allowed to accommodate statutory or calendar holidays and patient scheduling. MISSED 
DOSES: If a dose is missed due to toxicity during a cycle, that dose is not to be made up and 
is to be recorded as a missed dose.  

If the investigator suspects a drug-related toxicity, an extra-unscheduled visit with additional 
laboratory tests may be performed. 

ABI-007 and gemcitabine should be administered as specified in Section 4.2. 

The same mode of imaging for target lesions must be used at Baseline and throughout the 
study. CT image preparation will follow the specifications provided in the RECIST response 
guidelines. CT imaging should include contrast unless medically contraindicated and 
conventional CT should be performed with contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less in slice 
thickness. If spiral CT is used, it should be performed by use of a 5 mm contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm.  

SPARC-Immunohistochemistry Analysis 

In those cases where tumor samples from patients treated on study are available and informed 
consent has been obtained, tumor samples will be submitted, and paraffin-embedded (PE) 
blocks made for SPARC analysis. A technique called immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be 
performed in a central, CLIA-approved laboratory that has already been identified, to 
determine SPARC protein expression using tissue sections from each patient. If PE blocks 
are not available for release, PE tissue sections will be requested to be sent to the central 
laboratory for SPARC analysis. All tissue samples for SPARC analysis will be run blinded 
with respect to the treatment assignment and to the patient response to treatment.  The results 
of the SPARC IHC will be maintained and analyzed by Abraxis BioScience and released to 
investigators at or near the completion of the study. There are 2 routes to facilitate SPARC 
specimen analysis: (i) tissue samples can be shipped as PE blocks, or (ii) as PE sections on 
slides.  It is preferred that fixed tissue samples from patients are shipped as PE blocks so that 
slides from each specimen can be generated at the central testing laboratory for SPARC 
analysis. However, in cases where PE blocks may not be released from the custody of the 
site, the sections may be prepared at the site.  At least 10 slides (1 section per slide) should be 
prepared using super frost plus slides and left to AIR DRY. Thickness of the sections should 
be at 4-5 micron. Specimen collection kits, including super frost plus slides and return 
shipping containers, will be provided by the central laboratory to each of the specimen 
collection sites. 

Serum CA19-9 Blood samples for the evaluation of the CA19-9 molecular biomarker will be 

Confidential

collected within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment for both treatment arms.  Then, blood will 
be drawn every 8 weeks (on Day 1 of the cycle) for CA19-9 assessment.  CA19-9 is further 
discussed in Section 8.3.8.4.

An EOS evaluation should be performed for patients who are withdrawn from the study.  The 
following procedures will be completed at the EOS Visit:  
•  Physical examination; 
•  Weight assessment; 
•  Concomitant medication evaluation; 
•  Concomitant procedures; 
•  Vital signs; 
•  KPS performance status scale; 
•  Clinical chemistry panel; 
•  CBC, differential and platelet count; 
•  CT scan (or MRI if patient is allergic to contrast agent); 
•  Adverse event evaluation. 
 

The Investigator must follow all SAEs observed during the study until these events have 
resolved or stabilized, the patient is lost to follow-up, or the events are otherwise explained. 
The Investigator should report these SAEs in accordance with the procedures described in 
Section 7.8. Clinical laboratory tests may be repeated during the post-treatment period if 
clinically indicated. 

6.9  Follow-up for Adverse Events 

Any AE or SAE whose onset occurred between the first administration of study drug to 30 
days after the last dose of study drug or EOS (whichever is later) will be collected. The 
Investigator should report SAEs in accordance with the procedure described in Section 7.8.  

Adverse event follow-up will be conducted as follows:

Follow-up evaluations include studies necessary to document the resolution or persistence of 
any unresolved AEs and could include: 
•  Physical examination, weight; 
•  Concomitant medication/procedure evaluation;  
•  Vital signs; 
•  KPS Performance Status scale; 
•  CBC, differential, platelet count, and clinical chemistries; 
•  Peripheral neuropathy assessment (physician). 
 

6.10  Follow-up for Disease Progression 

Patients who are discontinued from treatment in the absence of disease progression (e.g., 
patients removed for unacceptable toxicity or patient/investigator discretion) should undergo 
repeat imaging and tumor response assessments until disease progression is documented. 
Imaging studies should be done every 8 weeks (at any time during that week), regardless of 
regimen. It is recommended that subsequent therapy not be instituted until disease 
progression is documented. 

6.11  Follow-up for Overall Survival 

Post-study, overall survival status will be monitored on a monthly basis for 6 months and 
then every 3 months thereafter for 12 months.  Patients will be followed for a total of 18 
months.  This evaluation may be by record review and/or telephone contact with the patient’s 
treating physician. 
7  ADVERSE EVENTS MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES 
7.1  Background 

These adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each patient 
while attempting to characterize the safety and tolerability of the test products.  In agreeing 
to the provisions of this protocol, the Investigator accepts all legal responsibilities for 
prompt notification of SAEs to Abraxis, the sponsor for this study.  Abraxis in turn will 
be responsible for reporting the SAEs to the appropriate regulatory authorities.    

Adverse events occurring during the study will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 
Scale (see http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html), where applicable. Adverse events that 

Confidential 
 

Page 44 

ABI-007 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CA046 
 
 
are not included on the toxicity scale will be designated as Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = 
moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life-threatening, and Grade 5 = death. 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

The Investigator should evaluate all adverse events and should make an immediate effort to 
determine their etiology. Adverse events that are determined not to be possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to study drug may not require further evaluation but will need to be 
recorded on the CRFs.  Study medications may be interrupted for an adverse event at the 
discretion of the Investigator. Patients requiring toxicity management should be assessed and 
evaluated at least weekly as indicated by the severity of the event. 

7.2  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) 

An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving a marketed 
pharmaceutical product or in a patient who is participating on a clinical trial who is receiving 
an investigational or non-investigational pharmaceutical agent.  The AE does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the patient’s treatment.  Therefore, an 
adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered to be related to the 
medicinal product.  In cancer clinical trials, many AEs are in fact related to progression of 
the patient’s underlying malignancy. 

An adverse event includes: 
•  an exacerbation of a pre-existing illness; 
•  an increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing episodic event or condition; 
•  a condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
•  continuously persistent disease or symptoms that were present at Baseline and worsen 

have been present prior to the start of the study; 

following the start of the study. 

 
An adverse event does not include: 
•  medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 

transfusion); however, the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event. 
[Procedures that occur during the trial should be recorded on the Concurrent Procedure 
CRF];  

•  pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected at the 
•  hospitalizations or procedures that are done for elective purposes not related to an 

start of the study that do not worsen;

social/convenience admissions); 

•  the disease being studied or signs/symptoms associated with the disease unless more 
•  overdose of study drug without any clinical signs or symptoms.

7.3  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose 
that: 
•  is fatal; 
•  is life-threatening (defined as an immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); 
•  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
•  requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization. (Exception: 

Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
during the study is not considered an adverse event. NOTE: Complications that occur 
during hospitalization are adverse events and if a complication prolongs hospitalization, 
then the event is serious); 

medication; 

•  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient who received 
•  conditions not included in the above definitions that may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above unless clearly related to 
the patient’s underlying disease. 

 
The Investigator should exercise medical and scientific judgment when deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations not strictly meeting the criteria outlined 
above. Examples of important medical events which may also meet the definition of a SAE 
include: intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for a reversible condition that 
did not result in hospitalization (e.g., allergic bronchospasm or convulsions), certain 
laboratory abnormalities (e.g., blood dyscrasias), or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. If there is any question, please consult the relevant Medical Monitor. 

7.4  Timeline for Consideration of AE/SAE Reporting Requirements   

The Investigator is responsible for recording, reporting and following all adverse events, 
regardless of causality, observed during the study period, starting with initial study drug 
administration and ending at the time the patient goes off study or 30 days after patient’s last 
dose of study drug, whichever is later.  Events occurring within 30 days prior to study drug 
administration should be recorded as pre-treatment signs and symptoms.  

7.5  Lack of Efficacy is not considered an AE or SAE 

“Lack of efficacy” (progressive disease) is not considered an adverse event. The signs and 
symptoms or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy should be reported if they 
fulfill the adverse event or SAE definitions.

7.6  Laboratory Results as Serious Adverse Events 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

According to the NCI CTCAE system of adverse event grading, laboratory values of Grade 3 
or 4 are described as “severe” or “life-threatening.”  For example, a neutrophils count 
<500/mm3 would meet laboratory criteria as Grade 4 (“life-threatening”).  This description is 
not always synonymous with the assessment of the “serious” criteria of an AE as “life-
threatening”.  In order for adverse events to be considered serious by “life-threatening” 
criteria, it must be medically judged as possessing “an immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred,” not because of the theoretical potential for life-threatening consequences.  In 
the case of a neutrophil count <500/mm3, the AE would be captured as an AE of Grade 4 
neutropenia, but it would not automatically be considered a SAE unless the investigational 
physician determined this represented an immediately life-threatening event for the patient. 
Specifically, uncomplicated Grade 4 neutropenia should not be reported as a SAE. 
Neutropenia associated with fever, infection, or hospitalization should be reported as a SAE. 

7.7  Patient Reporting of AEs and SAEs 

Patients are to be encouraged to call the site to report any unexpected symptoms or problems 
they encounter between office visits.  These events should be considered in the same fashion 
as if they had been reported at a scheduled office visit.  At each scheduled office visit, after 
the patient has had an opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator 
should inquire about adverse events by asking the following standard questions: 
•  Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last clinic visit? 
•  Have you taken any new prescribed or over-the-counter medicines or herbal/vitamin 
•  Have any new procedures been performed since your last study visit? 
 
7.8 

preparations, other than those given to you in this study, since your last visit/assessment? 

Investigator Reporting of AEs and SAEs 

The Investigator or designee must completely and promptly record each adverse event in the 
source documentation and in the appropriate CRF, regardless of relationship to study drug as 
determined by the Investigator. The Investigator must assess AE/SAE causality for any 
patients treated at his/her site.  The Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a 
diagnosis based on the patient's signs and symptoms. When a diagnosis for the reported signs 
or symptoms is known, the Investigator should report the diagnosis, not the symptoms, as the 
adverse event.  

Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities present at the Baseline visit will be recorded 
as pre-treatment signs and symptoms. After study treatment administration, laboratory 
abnormalities will not be recorded as adverse events unless considered clinically significant 
by the Investigator, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will not be recorded as 
serious AEs unless the event meets the definition of serious. 

AEs and SAEs should be reported on the appropriate Case Report Forms.  In addition, all 
SAEs must be reported promptly to Abraxis after the Investigator recognizes/classifies

the event as a SAE. The specific reporting time frame depends on the type of SAE. For life-
threatening or fatal events, the Investigator must report initial information on the SAE within 
24 hours, preferably by fax or alternatively by phone or email; at a minimum, a description of 
the event and the Investigator’s judgment of causality must be provided at the time of the 
initial report. If a SAE is reported by phone or by e-mail, the Investigator must fax a 
completed SAE report form to Abraxis within one business day. For an event that is not life-
threatening or fatal, the Investigator must fax a completed SAE report form within two 
business days after he/she recognizes/classifies the event as an SAE.

7.9  Additional Investigator Responsibilities on Follow-up of SAEs 

The Investigator and supporting personnel responsible for patient care should institute any 
supplemental investigations of SAEs based on their clinical judgment of likely causative 
factors. This may include extra clinical laboratory tests, discharge summary, physical 
examinations or consulting an appropriate specialist. Abraxis may also request the 
Investigator to conduct supplemental assessments. The results of any additional assessments 
conducted must be reported to Abraxis. If a patient dies during participation in the study and 
an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report must be submitted to Abraxis. If during the 
follow-up period for a SAE, a patient dies due to another event unrelated to the SAE 
being followed, the event causing the death will be reported as a separate SAE. 
7.10  IRB/EC Notification of SAEs 

The Investigator is responsible for promptly notifying the IRB/EC of all SAEs, including any 
follow-up information, occurring at his/her site and any SAE regulatory reports and 
Investigational New Drug Safety Reports that he/she receives from Abraxis.  (See Appendix 
1 for Guidelines for Reporting Adverse Events).

7.11  Sponsor Notification of Post-Study SAEs 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience

The Investigator should notify Abraxis of any death or SAE occurring after a patient has 
withdrawn from the study, when such death or SAE may reasonably be related to the 
medication used in the study. However, Investigators are not obligated to actively seek 
adverse events in former study participants. 
8  STATISTICAL METHODS 
8.1  Study Design and Sample Size 

This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, Phase III trial designed to evaluate the 
efficacy of the combination of ABI-007 and gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine alone in improving 
overall survival in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 

Three hundred fifteen patients randomized to each treatment arm (630 patients in total). This 
sample size will provide 80% power with two-sided Type I error of 0.05 to reject the null 
hypothesis that the ABI-007+ gemcitabine/gemcitabine hazard ratio for overall survival is 
equal to 1.0. This sample size calculation assumes ABI-007+gemcitabine has 30% 
improvement in overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone (HR=0.769) and patient 
follow-up will continue until at least 455 deaths occur. 

8.2  Populations in Analyses 

8.2.1 

Analysis Population  

All efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population, which includes all randomized 
patients regardless of whether the patient received any study drug or had any efficacy 
assessments collected. The Treated population, which includes all randomized patients who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug, will be the analysis population for all safety/ 
tolerability analyses.  Only patients with clear documentation that no study drug was 
administered will be excluded from the Treated population. 

8.2.2 

Patient Characteristics  

Patient characteristics including demographics, disease duration and extent at Baseline, and 
relevant medical history will be summarized for the purpose of characterizing the patient 
population and establishing baseline comparability of the randomized treatment regimens.  

8.2.3 

Patient Disposition  

Patient disposition including the number of patients randomized, treated, and each reason for 
discontinuation of therapy will be summarized by treatment regimen. Patient disposition also 
will be summarized by study site.

Prior and Concomitant Medications 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

All concomitant medications and prior medications taken within 30 days of first study drug 
administration will be coded to therapeutic drug classes and generic drug names using the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Classification. The incidence of prior and 
concomitant medication usage will be summarized by therapeutic drug class and generic drug 
names. 

8.3  Efficacy Analyses 

8.3.1  Overview 

The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival. Tumor response and PFS will be assessed 
by RECIST criteria on images obtained with CT scans.  Functional tumor response will be 
evaluated by PET scans.  CA19-9 response will be assessed by radioimmunoassay.  Patient 
clinical condition will be evaluated with periodic physical examinations and scoring of 
performance status.  The correlation between objective tumor response, functional tumor 
response, change in CA19-9 and overall survival will be assessed. Increases in SUV of PET 
or increases in CA19-9 levels should not be used as evidence for progressive disease or for 
removing patients from study. 

CT scans will be performed every 8 weeks; PET scans will be performed at Baseline and 
every 8 weeks; CA19-9 levels will be determined at Baseline and every 8 weeks (on Day 1 of 
that cycle).  Performance status will be scored weekly, and physical examination will be 
conducted at Baseline, at the beginning of each cycle (e.g., every 4 weeks), at the end of 
study visit and at the time of resolution of any adverse events. Radiologic studies for 
antitumor response will be repeated at the end of study visit if not done within the previous 
28 days. Phone follow-up or review of records will be done on a monthly basis for 6 months 
and every 3 months thereafter for 12 months (total of 18 months). 

8.3.2 

Definition of Measurable and Non-Measurable Lesions (ACR Practice 
Guidelines) 

8.3.2.1 

Measurable Lesion 

The definition of a measurable lesion at Baseline is dependent on the technical factors of the 
imaging studies that were used to evaluate the patient.  The recommendations for the imaging 
parameters are based on the American College of Radiology (ACR) Practice Guidelines and 
Technical Standards.  The ACR Practice Guidelines and Technical Standards define 
principles and technical parameters of radiologic and radiation oncology practice, which 
should generally produce desired health care outcomes.  They describe a range of acceptable 
approaches for the diagnosis and/or treatment of disease for most patients, in most 
circumstances.  Given differences in training, experience, and local conditions, the ACR 
Practice Guidelines and Technical Standards acknowledge the need for health care providers 
to exercise their independent medical judgment in making decisions regarding the use and 
specific details of any procedure.

ACR Practice Guidelines and Technical Standards are educational tools designed to provide 
consensus-based, scientifically valid and medically credible information to assist health care 
providers in delivering effective, efficient, consistent and safe medical care. They may be 
developed jointly with other professional organizations. Used in conjunction with the ACR 
Appropriateness Criteria®, it is expected that the ACR Practice Guidelines and Technical 
Standards will increase the likelihood that appropriate procedures will be performed in a safe 
and acceptable manner and will help reduce unnecessary procedures.  ACR Practice 
Guidelines and Technical Standards are intended to be living documents that are regularly 
reviewed and revised to reflect changes in radiologic and radiation oncology practice.   

The ACR Practice Guidelines describe recommended conduct in specific areas of clinical 
practice.  They are based on analysis of current literature, expert opinion, open forum 
commentary, and informal consensus. Guidelines are not intended to be legal standards of 
care or conduct and may be modified as determined by individual circumstances and 
available resources. 

The ACR Technical Standards describe technical parameters that are quantitative or 
measurable.  They often include specific recommendations for patient management or 
equipment specifications or settings.  Technical Standards are based on analysis of current 
literature, expert opinion, open forum commentary, and informal consensus. Technical 
Standards are intended to set a minimum level of acceptable technical parameters and 
equipment performance and may be modified as determined by individual circumstances and 
available resources. 

For Spiral CT scanning of the chest, the ACR recommendation is that reconstructions should 
be less than 10 mm, and for Spiral CT of the abdomen and pelvis, the recommendation is the 
slice thickness should be 8 mm or less.   

The RECIST paper indicates Spiral CT images for chest, abdomen and pelvis should be 
performed using 5 mm reconstructions, but it is not explicitly stated as a requirement. 

In preparing the technical specifications, we have followed the guidelines of the ACR, as 5 
mm reconstructions are not the standard in the US or the rest of the world.  Our proposal for 
modifying the size of measurable lesions at Baseline to two (2) times the reconstruction 
interval of the Baseline/screening studies is consistent with the RECIST definition for a 
measurable lesion.  
•  Conventional CT should be performed with contiguous cuts of ten (10) mm or less in 
reconstruction interval.  Spiral CT should be performed by use of a 5-8 mm contiguous 
reconstruction interval or less, where the neck and brain CTs should be done at five (5) 
mm or less. 

•  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one (1) dimension with the longest 
diameter (LD) ≥ twenty (20) mm with conventional techniques when the conventional 
scans are performed with a reconstruction interval of ten (10) mm or less are measurable 
lesions.

diameter (LD) being two (2) times the reconstruction interval (RI) of the spiral CT scan.  
Depending on the RI of the spiral CT (5-8 mm or less recommended) measurable lesion 
size may be ≥ 10-16 mm.  For example, a spiral CT scan done at eight (8) mm RI would 
have a minimum lesion size of sixteen (16) mm in the longest dimension.  The minimum 
size of a measurable lesion is ten (10) mm. 

•  In the instance where the reconstruction interval has changed from the Baseline to 

subsequent time points, it would be at the discretion of the radiologist whether this would 
affect interpretation.  A note is made in the comment section of the source document, if 
applicable.  The definition for target disease would not change and would be determined 
on the basis of the Baseline scan. 

 
8.3.2.2 

Non-Measurable Lesions 

All other lesions that do not meet the criteria for measurable disease as described in Section 
8.3.2.1 as well as other truly non-measurable lesions, are considered non-measurable. 

8.3.3 

Definition of Target, Non-Target and New Lesions (RECIST criteria) 

8.3.3.1 

Target Lesions 

Up to ten (10) target lesions, a maximum of five (5) per organ, will be chosen for 
measurement over the course of the study.  The distribution of these target lesions should be 
representative of the subject’s overall disease.  Target lesions should not be chosen from a 
previously irradiated area unless lesions in those areas have documented progression. 

Target lesions must be measurable at Baseline. These lesions will generally be the largest 
lesions, most reliably measured, and most representative of the patient’s sites of disease. 

For any target lesion at any time point, measurements will be taken and recorded uni-
dimensionally.  The longest dimension of each target lesion will be measured and recorded.  
The longest dimension of the target lesions will be summed to obtain the Sum of the Longest 
Diameters (SLD).  The Baseline SLD will be used as reference to further characterize the 
objective tumor response of the target lesions.  For the consideration of progressive disease, 
the nadir of the SLD for the target lesions will be used as reference. 

For cases where there is no target lesion identified, tumor assessment for progression should 
be done based on non-target lesion assessments (see Section 8.3.3.2) or the development of 
new lesions.  Response (PR or CR) and SD will not be assessed in subjects where target 
lesions are not identified at Baseline. 

The following conventions will be applied in selecting target lesions in patients who have 
received prior radiation therapy: 
•  Prior axillary radiation (i.e., prior radiation history including the term “axilla”, “axillary” 

or other related term(s) would not preclude the selection of measurable lesions in the 

Confidential 
 

Page 52 

ABI-007

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

chest wall or thorax as target lesions.  Ipsilateral axillary measurable disease cannot be 
selected as target lesions unless the site confirms on the Prior Radiation Therapy Form 
that the lesions are new since completing the radiation therapy. 

•  Prior breast (i.e., prior radiation history including the term “breast”) or chest wall 

radiation (i.e., prior radiation history including the term “chest wall” or other related 
term(s)) would preclude the selection of chest wall lesions as target disease for chest wall 
lesions ipsilateral to the site of the chest wall radiation.  Intrathoracic measurable lesions 
in the periphery of the lung, just deep to the radiated chest wall concordant with the 
radiation portal cannot be selected as target lesions.  However, if the lesions are more 
centrally located in the chest and do not appear in regions showing evidence of radiation 
injury (e.g., scarring, radiation pneumonitis, etc.), they can be selected as target lesions.  
The assigned radiologist will document descriptions of radiation damage in the 
comments field. 

•  Prior bone radiation (e.g., vertebral, rib, pelvis, femur, etc., as stated on the Prior 

Radiation Therapy Form) would not preclude the selection of measurable lesions in 
adjacent structures unless signs of radiation injury are evident (e.g., scarring). 

•  Prior soft tissue radiation (e.g., supraclavicular radiation, radiation of internal mammary 
lymph nodes, etc., as recorded on the Prior Radiation Therapy Form) would preclude the 
selection of measurable disease in the site of radiation unless the site confirms on the 
Prior Radiation Therapy Form that the lesions are new since radiation was completed. 

 
8.3.3.2 

Non-Target Lesions  

All of the sites of disease present at Baseline not classified as target lesions will be classified 
as non-target lesions.  Non-target lesions must be qualitatively assessed at each subsequent 
time point.  Examples of non-target lesions include: 
•  All bone lesions, irrespective of the modality used to assess them; 
•  Leptomeningeal disease; 
•  Lymphangitis of the skin or lung; 
•  Cystic lesions; 
•  Irradiated lesions that have not shown progression; 
•  Measurable lesions beyond the maximum number of 10; 
•  Groups of lesions that are small and numerous; and 
•  Pleural effusion/pericardial effusion/ascites. 
 
8.3.3.3 

New Lesions  

Unequivocal new lesions are those that were not present at Baseline. At each time point, the 
presence of new lesions will be determined.  New multi-focal or miliary disease of any size is 
considered a new lesion. 

Confidential 
 

Page 53 

ABI-007 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CA046 
 
 
Lesions that are encountered (subsequent to the Baseline) in anatomic locations that were not 
scanned at Baseline will be considered new lesions and will represent progressive disease. 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

 
 
 

Lesions that were present, which subsequently resolved and then recurred, will be considered 
new lesions and will represent progressive disease. 

8.3.4 

Antitumor Response (RECIST criteria) 

Antitumor response will be defined as the percent of patients who achieve an objective 
confirmed response (complete or partial response). Disease control rate (SD for at least 24 
weeks or confirmed CR or PR) also will be reported. Response will be determined according 
to RECIST guidelines.  The original RECIST guidelines were developed and published in the 
Journal of the National Cancer Institute.22 This study will employ RECIST guidelines with 
adjustments based on current practices of the medical community.  The charter of the blinded 
radiological review which will be conducted by Icon Medical Imaging outlines the 
modifications to the original RECIST guidelines. 

8.3.4.1 

Target Lesion Response (RECIST criteria) 

Percentage change in SLD will be evaluated by the following formulae: 

1. When determining complete response or partial response: 

((Post value – Baseline value)/Baseline value) x 100 

2. When determining progressive disease: 
(Post value – Nadir value since treatment started)/ (Nadir value since treatment started) x 100 
 
The following definitions will be used to evaluate response based on target lesions at each 
time point after Baseline: 

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. 

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the Baseline SLD.  

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage of target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the nadir SLD since the treatment 
started. 

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the nadir SLD recorded since the treatment started, or, the presence of one or more 
new lesions.  

Unable to Evaluate (UE): A target lesion present at Baseline which was not measured or 
which was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine the status of that 
particular tumor for the time point in question.  If the SLD cannot be determined at a time

point, and the rules for PD do not apply, a response of CR, PR or SD cannot be assigned for 
that time point and the time point response will be UE.   

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

 
 
 

Not Applicable (NA): No target lesions were identified at Baseline.  Patients with no target 
lesions identified at Baseline cannot be assessed for response.  These patients will be 
assessed for progression only. 

Not Done (ND): Scans were not performed at this time point to evaluate the target lesions. 

8.3.4.2 

Non-Target Lesion Response (RECIST criteria) 

Each non-target lesion will be qualitatively evaluated at each time point. Response of each 
lesion at each time point will be assessed with respect to the Baseline status.  Progression 
will be assessed with respect to nadir size of the non-target lesions.  The overall non-target 
lesion response for each time point will be assessed as the worst case for the non-target 
lesions for that particular time point. If a non-target lesion is classified as UE/ND, the non-
target response will be UE/ND unless progression is identified in the available non-target 
lesions. Response assessments are defined as follows: 

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. 

Stable Disease (SD): The persistence of one or more non-target lesions not qualifying for CR 
or PD. 

Progressive Disease (PD): The “unequivocal progression” of existing non-target lesion(s) or 
appearance of one or more new lesion(s) is considered progressive disease.  If PD for the 
subject is to be assessed for a time point based solely on the progression of non-target 
lesion(s), then additional criteria are required to be fulfilled.  In this instance, the lesion(s) 
upon which the assessment of PD is being made must be retrospectively assessed from 
Baseline (or the nadir) and compared to the time point in question. The radiologist will 
retrospectively review the nadir scan, and measure the size of the non-target lesion(s).  The 
radiologist will record these measurements in the comments section of the source document 
for the current time point.  PD of non-target lesion(s) in this instance will be assessed when 
the SLD of the lesion(s) has increased by 20% or greater and the lesion(s) measure greater 
than or equal to 10mm in longest dimension (LD) at the time of progression.  If the non-
target lesion(s) do not meet the quantitative criteria as described, they will not be assessed as 
having progressed. 

Unable to Evaluate (UE): Any non-target lesion present at Baseline which was not 
measured or was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine the status of that 
particular tumor for the time point in question.   

Not Applicable (NA): No non-target lesions were identified at Baseline. 

Not Done (ND): Scans were not performed at this time point to evaluate the non-target 
lesions.

Functional Tumor Response (EORTC Criteria) 

PET imaging with the fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is increasingly used to 
evaluate functional tumor response to chemotherapy.  The common measurement used by 
PET is the standard uptake value (SUV).  This is defined by tumor activity per dose injected 
per body mass, which is proportional to the glucose metabolic rate within the normal range of 
serum glucose concentration. 
 
According to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 
the following definitions will be used to evaluate response based on SUV reduction at each 
time point after 1 cycle of treatment.23 
 
Complete Response (CR): complete resolution of 18F-FDG uptake in the tumor.  

Confidential 
 

Page 56 

ABI-007 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CA046 
 
 
Partial Response (PR): decrease in SUV of 15%–25% after 1 cycle of treatment and a 
decrease of greater than 25% after more than 1 treatment cycle.  

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

 
 
 

Stable Disease (SD): Neither PD, PR, or CR. 

Progressive Disease (PD): increase in SUV of greater than 25% from Baseline or new 
lesions. 

Unable to Evaluate (UE): A lesion present at Baseline which was not assessed or which was 
unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine the status of that particular tumor 
for the time point in question.  If the SUV cannot be determined at a time point, and the rules 
for PD do not apply, a response of CR, PR or SD cannot be assigned for that time point and 
the time point response will be UE.   

 
8.3.6 

Primary Efficacy Endpoint 

The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival which will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
methods.  Survival will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
death (any cause). Patients who are alive will be censored at the last known time that the 
patient was alive. 

The null (Ho) and alternative (Ha) hypotheses for testing overall survival are:  

Ho: HRABI-007+Gemcitabine/Gemcitabine alone = 1 

Ha: HRABI-007+Gemcitabine/Gemcitabine alone ≠1 (superiority) 

Patient survival will be summarized by median survival time (including 95% CI) for each 
treatment arm along with the hazard ratio (including 95% CI). The Kaplan-Meier curve for 
survival will be presented for each treatment arm and differences in the curves will be tested 
using the stratified log-rank test. In the event that a specific stratum contains sparse data, then 
that strata will be pooled with the closest relevant strata. The 1-year survival rate will be 
summarized.  The final analysis for survival will be conducted when a total of at least 455 
deaths occur. 

8.3.7 

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  

The secondary efficacy endpoints (objective tumor response and PFS) will only be evaluated 
if the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrates superiority for ABI-007+Gemcitabine over 
Gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, statistical testing of the two secondary endpoints will be 
based on the Hochberg procedure which will test the secondary efficacy endpoint with the 
largest p-value at two-sided α=0.050 and if significant then both secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be declared statistically significant; but if non-significant then the other 
secondary efficacy endpoint will be tested at two-sided α=0.025.24

Objective Tumor Response (RECIST criteria) 

 
 
 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

The secondary efficacy endpoint of objective tumor response will be summarized by the 
percentage of patients that achieve a confirmed complete or partial response based on a 
blinded radiology assessment of response using RECIST response guidelines (including 95% 
CI) for each treatment arm.  Differences in response rates between the arms will be tested 
using the chi-square test. 

8.3.7.2 

Progression-Free Survival 

The secondary endpoint of PFS based on a blinded radiology assessment of response using 
RECIST response guidelines will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. PFS will be 
defined as the time from the day of randomization to the start of disease progression or death 
(any cause), whichever occurs first. Patients who do not have disease progression or have not 
died will be censored at the last known time that the patient was progression free.  If a patient 
begins a new anti-cancer therapy or has palliative radiotherapy or surgery at a lesion site 
prior to documented progression (or death), the patient will be censored at the last assessment 
where the patient was documented as progression free prior to the intervention.  Patients with 
two or more missing response assessments prior to a visit with documented progression (or 
death) will be censored at the last visit where the patient was documented to be progression 
free.  

PFS will be summarized by median PFS time (including 95% CI) for each treatment arm 
along with the hazard ratio (including 95% CI). The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS will be 
presented for each treatment arm and differences in the curves will be tested using the 
stratified log-rank test. 

8.3.8  Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 

8.3.8.1 

Disease Control 

Disease control (SD for ≥ 16 weeks or confirmed CR or PR) will be analyzed in the same 
manner as objective tumor response.  

8.3.8.2 

Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) 

TTF will be defined as the time from the day of randomization to treatment failure.  
Treatment failure is defined as disease progression, the start of a new anti-cancer therapy 
(including palliative radiotherapy or surgery at a lesion site), or death (any cause), whichever 
occurs first. TTF will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. 

8.3.8.3 

Time to Response and Response Duration 

TTR will be defined as the time from the day of randomization to the first occurrence of 
confirmed response (CR or PR) for responding patients. TTR will be analyzed using Kaplan-
Meier methods.

PFS for patients who achieve an objective confirmed complete or partial response will be 
presented as a measure of duration of response.  This is equivalent to the time from the 
randomization date to the start of disease progression or patient death (any cause), whichever 
occurs first, for responding patients.

8.3.8.4 

Changes in CA19-9  

Serum samples to assess the biomarker CA19-9 will be obtained at Baseline and every 8 
weeks (on Day 1 of the cycle).  CA19-9 levels and change in CA19-9 from Baseline will be 
summarized for each treatment regimen.  Descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, median, 
SD, minimum, and maximum values) will be used.  

8.3.8.5 

Functional Tumor Response (EORTC criteria) 

Functional tumor response will be evaluated according to EORTC criteria.  Functional tumor 
response will be analyzed in the same manner as objective tumor response.  

8.3.8.6 

Correlation between Objective Tumor Response and Functional Tumor 
Response 

The correlation between objective tumor response and functional tumor response will be 
evaluated by the chi-square test based on the patient’s best overall objective tumor response 
and best overall functional tumor response.  Differences in the objective and  functional 
response rates will be tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by 
treatment regimen.  

8.3.8.7 

Correlation of Objective Tumor Response, Functional Tumor Response, 
Change in CA19-9, with Overall Survival 

The correlation of objective tumor response, functional tumor response, change in CA19-9 
with overall survival will be evaluated by a Cox regression model. 

8.3.8.8 

SPARC and Other Molecular Biomarkers 

The correlation of SPARC and other molecular biomarkers with efficacy outcomes will be 
analyzed.  The following analyses will be performed for each treatment regimen.  Descriptive 
statistics will be used to summarize biomarkers for responders versus non-responders.  To 
assess relationship between response and biomarkers, a logistic regression analysis will be 
performed with effects for biomarker and treatment regimen in the model. To assess the 
relationship of overall survival (and PFS) with biomarkers, a Cox regression analysis will be 
used with effects for biomarker and treatment regimen in the model.  In addition, for SPARC 
and other biomarkers with binary measures, survival will be summarized by median survival 
time for each biomarker category along with the hazard ratio. For each treatment regimen, 
the Kaplan-Meier curve for survival will be presented graphically for each biomarker 
category and differences in the curves will be tested using the log-rank test.

8.4  Safety and Tolerability Analyses 

 
 
 

8.4.1  Overview 

Abraxis BioScience 
12 November 2008  
 

Patients in the Treated population will be followed for the development of AEs from study 
drug initiation through the end of study or 30 days after the end of treatment, whichever is 
later.  AEs and SAEs that develop during this period will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization (resolved with sequelae). Only patients with clear documentation that no study 
drug was administered may be excluded from the treated population. 

Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs), physical examination, laboratory abnormalities during study 
drug dosing and percentage of patients experiencing dose modifications, interruptions, and/or 
discontinuation for each treatment arm. 

8.4.2 

Adverse Events and Toxicities 

Adverse events will be recorded on the case report forms by the Investigator using verbatim 
terms that best describe the event. Grading of severity will be based upon the NCI CTCAE.  
All adverse events will be coded to a MedDRA term by the sponsor. All MedDRA terms will 
then be mapped into the appropriate NCI CTCAE term. 

Adverse events will be analyzed in terms of treatment-emergent AEs defined to be any AEs 
that begin or worsen in intensity after study drug initiation through 30 days after the last dose 
of study drug or EOS, whichever is later. 

The incidence of all adverse events (all AEs regardless of causality) and all treatment related 
adverse events (those AEs thought to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study 
drug) will be summarized by NCI CTCAE term and maximum grade for each treatment 
regimen, as well as reported by MedDRA preferred term; testing of treatment regimen 
differences will be performed using the CMH test. The incidence of Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) and AEs that lead to dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug will also be 
summarized. Listings of patients that discontinued study drug due to an adverse event, 
patients with SAEs and deaths will be presented. Patients with SAEs will be described by 
narrative. 

8.4.3 

Laboratory Assessments 

8.4.3.1 

Hematology parameters  

In order to investigate the maximal degree of myelosuppression, the NCI CTCAE grade for 
WBC, ANC, platelet count and hemoglobin will be summarized by the most severe grade in 
each treatment cycle and by the most severe grade during the study for each treatment 
regimen; testing of treatment regimen differences will be performed using the CMH test. The 
incidence of patients with NCI CTCAE hematology values of Grade 3 or 4 that occurred 
after the first dose of study drug also will be presented. Data for patients with Grade 3 or 4 
hematology values will be listed. 

Confidential

ABI-007 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CA046 
 
 
The nadir of each of these parameters will be presented in each cycle and overall.  For ANC 
and WBC, time to overall nadir and time to recovery will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
methods.

8.4.3.2 

Clinical chemistry  

Liver and renal function will be summarized using the NCI CTCAE for alkaline phosphatase, 
serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), total bilirubin, and creatinine. The 
number and percentage of patients that have each NCI CTCAE grade will be summarized 
using the most severe grade for the first cycle of therapy and for anytime during the study for 
each treatment regimen; testing of treatment regimen differences will be performed using the 
CMH test. The incidence of patients with NCI CTCAE chemistry values of Grade 3 or 4 that 
occurred after the first dose of study drug also will be presented. Data for patients with Grade 
3 or 4 chemistry values will be listed. 

8.5  Steering Committee 

The conduct of this trial will be overseen by a Steering Committee, presided by the Principal 
Investigator (PI) and representative Regional Investigators from countries participating in 
this study.  Functions of the Steering Committee include, but are not limited to, assessing 
reports provided on compliance with the protocol by participating sites, monitoring patient 
enrollment, and evaluating the appropriateness of continuing or stopping the study.  The 
Steering Committee will serve in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor.   

The Steering Committee will meet periodically to discuss the progress of the study, as well as 
based on need, as assessed by the sponsor.  The Steering Committee meetings shall include 
the study PI or his designee and require two thirds of its constituency to be present in order to

curred,  i.e.,  it  does  not  include  a  reac-
tion that, had it occurred in a more se-
vere form, might have caused death.

Serious  adverse  drug  experience:  Any
adverse  drug  experience  occurring  at
any dose that results in any of the fol-
lowing  outcomes:  Death,  a  life-threat-
ening  adverse  drug  experience,  inpa-
tient hospitalization or prolongation of
existing hospitalization, a persistent or
significant  disability/incapacity,  or  a
congenital  anomaly/birth  defect.  Im-
portant  medical  events  that  may  not
result  in  death,  be  life-threatening,  or
require  hospitalization  may  be  consid-
ered  a  serious  adverse  drug  experience
when,  based  upon  appropriate  medical
judgment, they may jeopardize the pa-
tient  or  subject  and  may  require  med-
ical or surgical intervention to prevent
one of the outcomes listed in this defi-
nition.  Examples  of  such  medical
events  include  allergic  bronchospasm
requiring  intensive  treatment  in  an
emergency  room  or  at  home,  blood
dyscrasias  or  convulsions  that  do  not
result  in  inpatient  hospitalization,  or

the development of drug dependency or
drug abuse.

Unexpected  adverse  drug  experience:
Any adverse drug experience, the speci-
ficity  or  severity  of  which  is  not  con-
sistent  with  the  current  investigator
brochure;  or,  if  an  investigator  bro-
chure  is  not  required  or  available,  the
specificity  or  severity  of  which  is  not
consistent  with  the  risk  information
described  in  the  general  investiga-
tional plan or elsewhere in the current
application,  as  amended.  For  example,
under  this  definition,  hepatic  necrosis
would  be  unexpected  (by  virtue  of
greater  severity)  if  the  investigator
brochure  only  referred  to  elevated  he-
patic  enzymes  or  hepatitis.  Similarly,
cerebral  thromboembolism  and  cere-
bral vasculitis would be unexpected (by
virtue  of  greater  specificity)  if  the  in-
vestigator  brochure  only  listed  cere-
bral vascular accidents. ‘‘Unexpected,’’
as  used  in  this  definition,  refers  to  an
adverse  drug  experience  that  has  not
been previously observed (e.g., included
in  the  investigator  brochure)  rather
than from the perspective of such expe-
rience  not  being  anticipated  from  the
pharmacological  properties  of 
the
pharmaceutical product.

(b)  Review  of  safety  information.  The
sponsor shall promptly review all infor-
mation  relevant  to  the  safety  of  the
drug obtained or otherwise received by
the sponsor from any source, foreign or
domestic,  including  information  de-
rived from any clinical or epidemiolog-
ical  investigations,  animal  investiga-
tions,  commercial  marketing  experi-
ence,  reports  in  the  scientific  lit-
erature,  and  unpublished  scientific  pa-
pers,  as  well  as  reports  from  foreign
regulatory  authorities  that  have  not
already been previously reported to the
agency by the sponsor.

(c)  IND  safety  reports.  (1)  Written  re-
ports—(i) The sponsor shall notify FDA
and all participating investigators in a
written IND safety report of:

(A)  Any  adverse  experience  associ-
ated  with  the  use  of  the  drug  that  is
both serious and unexpected; or

(B) Any finding from tests in labora-
tory  animals  that  suggests  a  signifi-
cant risk for human subjects including
reports 
mutagenicity,
teratogenicity, 
carcinogenicity.
Each notification shall be made as soon

or 

of 

as  possible  and  in  no  event  later  than
15 calendar days after the sponsor’s ini-
tial  receipt  of  the  information.  Each
written  notification  may  be  submitted
on  FDA  Form  3500A  or  in  a  narrative
format  (foreign  events  may  be  sub-
mitted  either  on  an  FDA  Form  3500A
or, if preferred, on a CIOMS I form; re-
ports  from  animal  or  epidemiological
studies  shall  be  submitted  in  a  nar-
rative  format)  and  shall  bear  promi-
nent identification of its contents, i.e.,
‘‘IND Safety Report.’’ Each written no-
tification  to  FDA  shall  be  transmitted
to the FDA new drug review division in
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-
search  or  the  product  review  division
in  the  Center  for  Biologics  Evaluation
and  Research  that  has  responsibility
for  review  of  the  IND.  If  FDA  deter-
mines that additional data are needed,
the agency may require further data to
be submitted.

(ii)  In  each  written  IND  safety  re-
port, the sponsor shall identify all safe-
ty  reports  previously  filed  with  the
IND concerning a similar adverse expe-
rience,  and  shall  analyze  the  signifi-
cance of the adverse experience in light
of the previouos, similar reports.

(2)  Telephone  and  facsimile  trans-
mission safety reports. The sponsor shall
also notify FDA by telephone or by fac-
simile  transmission  of  any  unexpected
fatal  or  life-threatening  experience  as-
sociated  with  the  use  of  the  drug  as
soon  as  possible  but  in  no  event  later
than  7  calendar  days  after  the  spon-
sor’s initial receipt of the information.
Each telephone call or facsimile trans-
mission to FDA shall be transmitted to
the  FDA  new  drug  review  division  in
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-
search  or  the  product  review  division
in  the  Center  for  Biologics  Evaluation
and  Research  that  has  responsibility
for review of the IND.

(3) Reporting format or frequency. FDA
may  request  a  sponsor  to  submit  IND
safety  reports  in  a  format  or  at  a  fre-
quency  different  than  that  required
under this paragraph. The sponsor may
also  propose  and  adopt  a  different  re-
porting  format  or  frequency  if  the
change  is  agreed  to  in  advance  by  the
director  of  the  new  drug  review  divi-
sion in the Center for Drug Evaluation
and  Research  or  the  director  of  the
products  review  division  in  the  Center

(4)  A  sponsor  of  a  clinical  study  of  a
marketed drug is not required to make
a  safety  report  for  any  adverse  experi-
ence  associated  with  use  of  the  drug
that  is  not  from  the  clinical  study
itself.

(d)  Followup.  (1)  The  sponsor  shall
promptly  investigate  all  safety  infor-
mation received by it.

(2)  Followup  information  to  a  safety
report  shall  be  submitted  as  soon  as
the relevant information is available.

(3) If the results of a sponsor’s inves-
tigation show that an adverse drug ex-
perience not initially determined to be
reportable  under  paragraph  (c)  of  this
section  is  so  reportable,  the  sponsor
shall  report  such  experience  in  a  writ-
ten  safety  report  as  soon  as  possible,
but  in  no  event  later  than  15  calendar
days after the determination is made.

(4)  Results  of  a  sponsor’s  investiga-
tion  of  other  safety  information  shall
be  submitted,  as  appropriate,  in  an  in-
formation  amendment  or  annual  re-
port.

(e)  Disclaimer.  A  safety  report  or
other information submitted by a spon-
sor under this part (and any release by
FDA  of  that  report  or  information)
does  not  necessarily  reflect  a  conclu-
sion by the sponsor or FDA that the re-
port  or  information  constitutes  an  ad-
mission  that  the  drug  caused  or  con-
tributed  to  an  adverse  experience.  A
sponsor need not admit, and may deny,
that  the  report  or  information  sub-
mitted  by  the  sponsor  constitutes  an
admission that the drug caused or con-
tributed to an adverse experience.
