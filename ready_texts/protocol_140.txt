Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

TITLE:  A Phase III, Randomised, Open-Label, Study of CAELYX™ versus Paclitaxel 
HCl in Patients with Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma Following Failure of First-Line, 
Platinum-Based Chemotherapy 

OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 
CAELYX versus Paclitaxel HCl in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following 
failure of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy.   

PRIMARY ENDPOINT:  Time to progression following treatment with either CAELYX 
or Paclitaxel HCl. 

SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: Response rates, time to response, duration of response, 
quality of life assessment, and survival following treatment with either CAELYX or 
Paclitaxel HCl. 

PATIENT POPULATION:  Up to a total of 438 protocol-eligible patients (in order to 
obtain 350 evaluable patients), with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure of 
first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy. 

STUDY DESIGN: This is a randomised, open-label, comparative study of CAELYX 
versus Paclitaxel HCl in the treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma 
following failure of first line chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen.  Patients 
entering the trial will be stratified prospectively for platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease 
and analysed retrospectively for prior anthracycline therapy.  Protocol-eligible patients, 
with measurable disease, who have received no more than one prior regimen, which was 
platinum-based, will be randomised to receive either a one-hour intravenous infusion of 
CAELYX, 50 mg/m2 every 28 days, or Paclitaxel HCl, 175 mg/m2 as a 3 hour infusion 
every 21 days. Patients will be treated for up to one year.  It is suggested that responding 
patients receive at least 6 cycles of treatment.  Patients with ongoing clinical benefit may 
continue study drug upon approval of the sponsor as long as it is in the patient’s interest 
and in the absence of severe toxicity.  It is suggested that patients exhibiting a complete 
response (CR) receive 2 subsequent cycles of treatment. Patients exhibiting partial 
response (PR) may continue to receive study drug as long as therapeutic benefit is being 
derived but it is suggested that they receive at least 3 subsequent cycles of study drug.   

Patients will undergo appropriate radiological imaging (x-ray, CT scan, MRI) to 
document baseline disease, as well as a chest x-ray and an assessment of left ventricular

ejection fraction (LVEF) by MUGA scan within 30 days prior to the first dose of study 
drug. Patients will be followed weekly for hematological toxicities.  Radiological imaging 
will be repeated every 7-8 weeks to assess disease status.  Patients who achieve complete 
or partial response will be reevaluated 4 weeks later to confirm the initial observation of 
response.  All patients will be followed for a minimum of one year for disease 
progression and survival. 

LVEF will be assessed by MUGA scan at baseline, when the cumulative anthracycline 
dose reaches 300 mg/m2 (500 mg/m2 epirubicin), and after every 2 cycles of CAELYX 
thereafter.  Endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for patients who have received > 400 
mg/m2 of CAELYX alone or a cumulative anthracycline dose of > 550 mg/m2 (including 
CAELYX; 900 mg/m2 if epirubicin). 

STATISTICAL RATIONALE AND ANALYSIS:  A statistical rationale for the number 
of patients has been provided using the proportional hazard model.  Two interim analyses 
are planned after approximately 190 and 264 evaluable patients have either experienced 
disease progression or have been on study for at least 6 months.  

SAFETY:  Physical examinations, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and patient 
monitoring for adverse events.

1.1  Background and Rationale 

 

1.1.1  Ovarian Cancer 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

In Europe and the United States, ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of death due to 
gynecologic malignancies.  Approximately 26,700 women in the U.S. alone will be 
diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1996, with an estimated 14,800 deaths due to the 
disease.1  Although the median age at diagnosis is 59 years, the highest age-related 
incidence is seen in women in their mid-to-late 70s.  Survival correlates most strongly 
with surgical staging, and 5-year survival rates for Stages I, II, III, and IV are 74%, 58%, 
30%, and 19%, respectively.  Ovarian cancer is rarely detected in an early stage; 75% to 
85% of patients are first diagnosed with advanced disease (Stages III and IV).2, 3  

The extent of disease in ovarian cancer patients is generally described as either "early 
stage" or "late stage."  For patients with advanced-stage (Stage III or IV) disease, 
combined modality therapy, consisting of aggressive surgical debulking followed by 
platinum-based combination chemotherapy, is the standard of care. 4   With carboplatin- 
or cisplatin-based therapy, a response rate of 60% to 80%  is seen, with a complete 
response rate of 30% to 50%.5,6  Platinum-based multidrug chemotherapy produces a 
slightly better overall response rate, but no difference in survival.  Median survival is 18 
to 24 months, and 5-year survival for patients with Stage III and IV disease is 15% to 
20%.5 As a result of recent GOG studies, paclitaxel and cisplatin therapy is considered by 
many to be the new standard of care for patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.7  
The majority of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer  have a complete clinical 
response (defined by normal physical exam, CT studies, and CA 125) following surgical 
debulking and post-operative chemotherapy.8  However, only 50% of these patients have 
a complete pathological response (defined by negative biopsy specimens obtained during 
second-look laparotomy). 9  

Platinum-sensitivity, which is defined by response to first-line platinum-based therapy, is 
predictive of the response to subsequent retreatment with a platinum-containing regimen.  
Patients who progress during treatment or have stable disease in response to initial 
platinum-based therapy or who relapse within 6 months are considered to have platinum-
refractory disease.  On the other hand, patients with recurrent disease are designated as 
potentially "platinum-sensitive" if they have a progression-free interval of greater than 
6 months after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.  These patients have a

20% to 30% chance of responding to retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and 
they are also likely to respond to non-platinum regimens.  In general, a worse prognosis is 
seen for those patients with progressive disease during their initial chemotherapy, residual 
bulky disease after initial therapy, or recurrent disease within 6 months of treatment.  
Such patients are much less likely to respond to subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy 
regimens.10, 11 A response rate of less than 10% is observed for patients with a treatment-
free interval of less than 6 months, with improvement in response rates as the treatment-
free interval is lengthened. 

Patients with recurrent disease have usually been exposed to platinum (cisplatin and/or 
carboplatin) and/or an alkylator, with or without an anthracycline, or paclitaxel.  While a 
patient with recurrent disease is rarely cured, some patients can be rendered disease-free 
for variable periods of time, even years.  In the majority of patients with recurrent disease, 
radiographic evidence of persistent disease, with or without chemical evidence or 
findings on physical examination, will be present.  In other instances, evidence of disease 
may be present only on physical examination or suspected on the basis of a rising 
CA-125.12  

CA-125 levels may be elevated in up to 80% of ovarian malignancies. Because serum 
CA-125 levels may also be elevated or fluctuate in the presence of non-malignant 
conditions, measurement of CA-125 has not proven to be useful as a screening test. 
However, decreasing levels are often associated with response to therapy and increasing 
levels with tumour progression. 12  

 

 

1.1.2  Chemistry and Pharmacology of CAELYX™ 

The anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin has a broad spectrum of antineoplastic action 
and a correspondingly widespread degree of clinical use.  In addition to its role in the 
treatment of breast cancer, doxorubicin is indicated in the treatment of Hodgkin’s Disease 
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, hepatocellular and gastric carcinoma, small cell cancer of 
the lung, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, as well as cancer of the ovary, bladder, and 
thyroid.  Unfortunately, toxicity often limits the therapeutic activity of doxorubicin and 
may preclude adequate dosing. 

The conventional formulation of the drug is rapidly cleared from the bloodstream and has 
a very large volume of distribution, which may contribute to the drug's toxicity.  High 
cumulative doses of doxorubicin generally must be avoided because of the potential for 
cardiotoxicity, while individual doses are often limited by myelosuppression.  Alopecia 
typically develops and persists throughout treatment.  Severe acute nausea and vomiting,

stomatitis, and oesophagitis are additional adverse effects of doxorubicin that may 
necessitate dose-reduction or discontinuation of the drug.  A doxorubicin formulation 
with improved tolerability would increase the drug's therapeutic ratio and thus enhance its 
efficacy. 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

Liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin may reduce both the nonspecific drug delivery to 
normal tissues as well as the high peak plasma levels of free drug responsible for its 
toxicity.  At the same time, a liposomal formulation may deliver doxorubicin to tumours 
with improved specificity.  CAELYX™ (also known as DOXIL™ in some countries) is a 
doxorubicin formulation in which the drug is encapsulated in liposomes (STEALTH® 
liposomes) that escape instant recognition and uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte 
system.  As a result, the formulation has a long circulation time, and the liposomes can 
eventually become extravasated through the abnormally permeable vessels characteristic 
of many tumours.  Once concentrated in tumours, the liposomes of CAELYX can deliver 
high levels of doxorubicin to malignant cells, without affecting normal tissue. 

On-going clinical studies with CAELYX suggest a favourable toxicity profile when 
compared with standard anthracyclines.  Evaluation of the long-term cardiac effects of 
CAELYX, as compared to the conventional formulation of doxorubicin, is on-going.  
There is evidence suggesting that CAELYX is less cardiotoxic than conventional 
doxorubicin.  Histological examination of cardiac biopsies from patients who received 
cumulative doses of CAELYX from 440 to 840 mg/m2, and had no prior exposure to 
anthracyclines, revealed significantly less cardiac toxicity than in matched doxorubicin 
controls (p < 0.001).13  In addition to diminished cardiac toxicity, diminished 
gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea/vomiting), decreased incidence of alopecia, and a shorter 
depth and duration of granulocytopenia have been noted. 

Additional information on the pharmacology and pharmacodynamics of CAELYX can be 
found in the May, 1996 Investigator's Brochure. 

 

 

1.1.3  Rationale for the Use of CAELYX 

Doxorubicin has not had a role as a salvage agent for ovarian cancer after cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy; response rates have been low and toxicity has been substantial.  Moreover, 
a reduced sensitivity to doxorubicin in a clonogenic assay in tumours obtained from 
patients after initial doxorubicin treatment has been described.14  It is unclear what 
accounts for this decreased sensitivity, and one possibility is enhanced multi-drug 
resistant 1 (MDR1) expression.15

Liposomal encapsulation may overcome resistance mediated by MDR1.16,17  Furthermore, 
several animal studies have shown that STEALTH® liposomal doxorubicin (CAELYX) is 
tolerated at higher doses than free doxorubicin.  Preclinical studies have shown a clear 
superiority of CAELYX over free doxorubicin against human ovarian cancer xenografts 
in nude mice.18 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

CAELYX has been studied extensively in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma 
(N = 1200) and in patients with solid tumours (N = 200).  There are well-documented 
cases of anthracycline failure in some Kaposi's sarcoma patients who have subsequently 
responded to CAELYX at a dose of 20 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.  In this population, 
43 patients were identified as having progressed on prior chemotherapy with Adriamycin.  
Of those 43 patients, response rates ranged from 27% to 52% depending on the method of 
measurement.19 

In 2 separate Phase I dose-escalation studies, 56 patients with breast, prostate, ovarian, 
non-small-cell lung (NSCL), melanoma, mesothelioma, pancreatic, GI, uterine, renal cell, 
sarcoma, head and neck, or colorectal cancer were treated with CAELYX in doses of 
20-80 mg/m2. 20  Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis were dose-limiting at 
70 mg/m2 and above.  Skin toxicity manifested primarily as palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia (PPE) was dose-limiting after repetitive doses, but tolerable at doses of 
50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks.  Patients with carcinomas of the breast, ovary, prostate and head 
and neck showed responses or improvement based on tumour markers. 

Substantial clinical activity has been demonstrated in patients with ovarian carcinoma 
refractory to platinum and paclitaxel.21  Of 35 patients enrolled in a Phase II study in 
which CAELYX was administered in a dose of 50 mg/m2, 9 patients achieved responses: 
1 patient achieved a Complete Response, 6 patients achieved partial responses, and 2 
patients achieved unconfirmed partial responses.  The duration of response ranges from 
3.1 months to 10.7 months, with a median time to progression of 6.0 months.  While 
median survival has not yet been reached, the 6-month survival is 77 - 80%. 

Preliminary results of the use of CAELYX in 60 patients with breast cancer have been 
reported recently.22  These patients received CAELYX in doses of 60 mg/m2 every 3 
weeks, as well as a better tolerated dose of 45 mg/m2 every 4 weeks.  Response occurred 
in 16/43 evaluable patients, with 3 CRs and 13 PRs. The trial is on-going.  Thus far, 72 
patients have been enrolled in this study, and 55 are evaluable; responses have been seen 
in 31% of those patients.

1.1.4  Rationale for the Use of Paclitaxel HCl  

) and is a novel antitumour agent 

Paclitaxel HCl is sold as Taxol® (
which promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilises 
microtubules by preventing depolymerisation.  This stability results in the inhibition of 
the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital 
interphase and mitotic cellular functions.  In addition, paclitaxel HCl induces abnormal 
arrays or “bundles” of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of 
microtubules during mitosis. 
 
Paclitaxel HCl was approved initially by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
1992 for the treatment of women with epithelial ovarian cancer on the basis of the results 
of trials of paclitaxel HCl given at doses of 110 to 135 mg/m2 as 24-hour infusions.  In 
the first of these studies, 30% of a group of heavily pretreated women had major 
antitumour response; with 24% of women considered resistant to platinum-based therapy 
(progresssion within 6 months)  responding and 40% of patients who relapsed after more 
than 6 months doing so. Although severe neutropenia occured during most courses, even 
at relatively low doses, it was short-lived and rarely associated with fever. 23 (review) 
 
These results were confirmed in a treatment-referral-centre program instituted by the US 
National Cancer Institute. 24 Through this program, paclitaxel HCl (135 mg/m2 over 24 
hours) was provided to women whose ovarian cancer had progressed after treatment with 
three prior regimen.  22% of the first 1000 patients had major responses despite their poor 
prognostic characteristics. 
 
Different doses and durations of infusion have been explored in a joint European & 
Canadian paclitaxel trial. 25  In this trial, the effects of two doses (135 and 175 mg/m2) 
were similar when given as either 24-hour or 3-hour infusions, with premedication for 
hypersensitivity reactions.  Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the high-
dose group than in the low-dose group (18 vs. 14 weeks, p = 0.02), but survival was 
similar in both dose and schedule groups.  These results were the impetus for the 
subsequent regulatory approval of doses of 175 mg/m2 of paclitaxel HCl administered 
over a period of 3 hours for  women with drug-refractory and recurrent ovarian cancer. 
This phase III study (SEQU-30-57) is being conducted by SEQUUS to compare 
CAELYX with paclitaxel HCl at this dose and schedule for the treatment of patients who 
have failed first line platinum therapies.  A phase III study (SEQU-30-49) is also being 
conducted by SEQUUS to compare CAELYX with topotecan for a similar patient group.

1.1.5  Cardiac Safety  

 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

Over 1200 patients have been treated with CAELYX in a variety of clinical trials with 
cumulative anthracycline doses of 400-1000 mg/m2. Whilst no significant incidence of 
clinical cardiac toxicity has been encountered, the majority of such patients have been 
treated at doses of 20-30 mg/m2 every 2-3 weeks.  Patients in this study (SEQU-30-57) 
will be receiving CAELYX at a higher dose level.   

The most reliable method of predicting anthracycline-associated cardiac injury is by 
endomyocardial biopsy of the right ventricular septum. 26  In this study, it is 
recommended that patients who have received > 400 mg/m2 of CAELYX alone or a 
cumulative anthracycline dose of > 550 mg/m2 (including CAELYX ; 900 mg/m2 if 
epirubicin) undergo an endomyocardial biopsy to be conducted locally or in London 
(under the supervision of Dr. 
receiving further anthracycline treatment.  Any patients not prepared to undergo this 
procedure, are to be provided with full information on the likely risks of cardiotoxicity 
associated with receiving continued treatment with CAELYX or other anthracyclines so 
that an informed decision can be taken about their ongoing treatment. 

and funded by SEQUUS) prior to 

 

1.2  Objective 

The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of CAELYX versus 
Paclitaxel HCl in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure of first-line, 
platinum-based chemotherapy.  

 

1.3  Study Design 

This is a randomised, open-label, comparative study of CAELYX versus Paclitaxel HCl 
in the treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure of first-
line chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen.  In order to obtain 350 evaluable 
patients, it is expected that up to 438 patients will be enrolled.  Patients entering the trial 
will be stratified prospectively for platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease and analysed 
retrospectively for prior anthracycline therapy.  Protocol-eligible patients, with 
measurable disease, who have received no more than one prior regimen, which was 
platinum-based, will be randomised to receive either a one-hour intravenous infusion of 
CAELYX, 50 mg/m2 every 28 days or Paclitaxel HCl, 175 mg/m2 as a 3 hour infusion 
every 21 days. Patients will be treated for up to one year.  It is suggested that responding 
patients receive at least 6 cycles of treatment.  Patients with ongoing clinical benefit may 
continue study drug upon approval of the sponsor as long as it is in the patient’s interest

and in the absence of severe toxicity.  It is suggested that patients exhibiting a complete 
response (CR) receive 2 subsequent cycles of treatment. Patients exhibiting partial 
response (PR) may continue to receive study drug as long as therapeutic benefit is being 
derived but it is suggested that they receive at least 3 subsequent cycles of study drug. 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

Patients will undergo appropriate radiological imaging (x-ray, CT scan, MRI) to 
document baseline disease, as well as a chest x-ray and an assessment of left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) by MUGA scan within 30 days prior to the first dose of study 
drug. Patients will be followed weekly for hematological toxicities.  Radiological imaging 
will be repeated every 7-8 weeks to assess disease status.  Patients who achieve complete 
or partial response will be reevaluated 4 weeks later to confirm the initial observation of 
response.  All patients will be followed for a minimum of one year for survival. 

LVEF will be assessed by MUGA scan at baseline, when the cumulative anthracycline 
dose reaches 300 mg/m2 (500 mg/m2 epirubicin), and after every 2 cycles of CAELYX 
thereafter.  Endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for patients who have received > 400 
mg/m2 of CAELYX alone or a cumulative anthracycline dose of > 550 mg/m2 (including 
CAELYX ; 900 mg/m2 if epirubicin). 

Primary endpoint is time to progression following treatment with either CAELYX or 
Paclitaxel HCl. 

Secondary endpoints are response rates, time to response, duration of response, survival, 
and quality of life assessment following treatment with either CAELYX or Paclitaxel 
HCl. 

Safety will be assessed by examination of adverse events, clinical laboratory data, and 
vital signs (See Schedule of Events, pages vi and vii).

2.4  Randomisation 

Randomisation will be 1:1 between the two treatment regimens.  Patients will be 
stratified prospectively for platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease and analysed 
retrospectively for prior anthracycline therapy. Platinum-sensitivity is defined by response 
to first-line platinum-based therapy.  Patients will be assigned to either CAELYX or 
Paclitaxel HCl and, once randomized, will receive the same drug until disease 
progression.  (For definitions, see Sec. 8.2) 

Any patient who withdraws  from the study prior to completion of 2 cycles of therapy will 
be replaced, but the patient number will not be reassigned in these cases.  SEQUUS will 
generate random treatment assignments for each stratum, as well as a set of replacement 
patient numbers.

4.2  Dose, Administration and Treatment Schedule 

 
 
 
 
Patients randomised to receive Paclitaxel will be given the drug at a dose of 175 mg/m2 
by intravenous infusion over 3 hours starting on day 1 of a 21-day cycle according to the 
guidelines provided in Appendix IV (Instructions for Drug Storage and Administration of 
Paclitaxel).  That is, Paclitaxel must be diluted using aseptic techniques, prior to infusion 
to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL and should be administered over a period of 
3 hours using non-PVC containing equipment through an in-line filter with a microporous 
membrane not greater than 0.22 µm (see “Pharmaceutical precautions” in Appendix IV).  
For this study the recommended diluent is 5% Glucose Intravenous Infusion. 
 
Paclitaxel may be administered on an outpatient basis for patients who do not require 
hospitalisation.   
 
All Paclitaxel patients must be premedicated with corticosteroids, antihistamines and H2 
antagonists prior to Paclitaxel administration, e.g., dexamethasone 20 mg orally 
approximately 12 and 6 hours before Paclitaxel, chlorpheniramine 10 mg IV 30 to 60 
minutes prior  to Paclitaxel and cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 50 mg IV 30 to 60 
minutes before Paclitaxel (see “Contra-indications”, “Precautions and warnings” in 
Appendix IV) . 

 

Serious events occurring most frequently  with Paclitaxel are bone marrow suppression 
and peripheral neuropathy (see “Contra-indications”, “Precautions and warnings” in 
Appendix IV) .  The dose limiting toxicity of Paclitaxel is bone marrow suppression 
(primarily neutropenia).  Frequent monitoring of blood counts will be instituted in this 
study to enable management of this side effect with G-CSF if need be.   
Treatment with either drug will be continued for up to 1 year in the absence of disease 
progression.

4.3.1.1 Haematological Toxicity 

Prior to the administration of the first course of Paclitaxel HCl, patients must have a 
baseline neutrophil count of > 1500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count of 
> 100,000 cells/mm3.  
The minimum blood counts prior to re-dosing with Paclitaxel are as follows: 
 

 
 

ANC count ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L  
Platelet count ≥ 100 x109 /L  

 
The dose of Paclitaxel will be reduced by ONE level (to 135 mg/m2) if Grade IV 
neutropenia or Grade III thrombocytopenia persists for > 7 days as defined by:

If neutropenia or thrombocytopenia persists at a subsequent cycle for > 7 days (as defined 
above), the dose level can be reduced further by ONE more level (to 110 mg/m2).  See 
Appendix Vb. 
 
Once reduced, the dose level should not be increased for the duration of the patient’s 
subsequent treatment on this study. 
 
 

 4.3.1.2 Mucositis or Stomatitis 

 4.3.1.3 Neuropathy 

For patients who experience > Grade III mucositis which persists for > 7 days, the dose of 
Paclitaxel will be reduced by ONE level (to 135 mg/m2). If mucositis persists at a 
subsequent cycle for > 7 days (as defined above), the dose level can be reduced further by 
ONE more level (to 110 mg/m2).   
 
 
 
For patients who experience > Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, the dose of Paclitaxel will 
be reduced by ONE level (to 135 mg/m2). If neuropathy worsens by one Grade at a 
subsequent cycle and persists at this level for > 7 days (as defined above), the dose level 
can be reduced further by ONE more level (to 110 mg/m2).   
 
 
 
If patient experiences an ACUTE INFUSION REACTION whilst receiving Paclitaxel, 
the infusion should be DISCONTINUED IMMEDIATELY.  Symptomatic therapy should 
be initiated (administer IV chlorpheniramine and dexamethasone. Add adrenaline 
(1:1000) or bronchodilators, as indicated).  The patient should NOT BE 
RECHALLENGED WITH THE DRUG.  Severe symptoms are defined as severe 
hypotension, angioedema, respiratory distress requiring bronchodilation therapy, 
generalised urticaria. 
 
Moderate sensitivity reactions do not require interruption of therapy. Moderate symptoms 
are defined as moderate rash, flushing, mild dyspnoea or chest discomfort.  For moderate 
symptoms,  Paclitaxel infusion should be stopped and symptomatic therapy should be

If Grade 1 toxicity persists when the dose has been delayed for 2 weeks (6 weeks since 
the last dose), then reduce the study drug dose by 25% and continue dosing at 4-week 
intervals.  If Grade 2 or greater PPE is present on the scheduled day for dosing, hold 
treatment for 1 week.  If the patient still exhibits PPE of Grade 2 or greater after treatment 
has been discontinued for 1 week, hold treatment for an additional week.  If the patient 
continues to exhibit Grade 2 toxicity after the dose has been delayed for 2 weeks (6 weeks 
since the last dose), then resume treatment at 4-week intervals with CAELYX at a 25%

dose (6 weeks since the last dose), discontinue study drug therapy. 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

Whenever PPE symptoms persist for 6 weeks or longer, the investigator may elect to 
follow the dose modifications outlined above or to withdraw the patient from the study, 
based on the overall risks/benefits analysis. 
If  symptoms  of  PPE  are  encountered,  50  mg  orally  TID  of  pyridoxine  (B-6)  is 
recommended.27,28    
 

4.3.2.2  Hematological Toxicities 

 

 

Prior to the administration of the first course of CAELYX, patients must have a baseline 
neutrophil count of > 1500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count of > 100,000 cells/mm3.  
The minimum blood counts prior to re-dosing with CAELYX are as follows: 

ANC count   ≥1.5 x 109 /L 
Platelet count ≥ 75 x109 /L 

If a patient develops Grade 3 or greater neutropenia or thrombocytopenia study drug will 
be withheld until both are resolved to Grade 1 (ANC > 1500, platelets > 75,000) after 
which study treatment will resume with no dose modification.   

ANC count  < 1.0 x 109 /L   ≥  7 days (Grade 3) 
Platelet count < 50 x 109 /L   ≥  7 days (Grade 3) 

If prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 for > 7 days) or thrombocytopenia 
(platelet count < 25,000) develops, wait until both are resolved to Grade 1 and resume 
treatment  with either of the following options:  A) Resume CAELYX with a 25% 
reduction in dose; or B) Continue full dose CAELYX therapy with cytokine support.  

 
 

ANC count  < 0.5 x 109 /L   ≥  7 days (Grade 4) 
Platelet count < 25 x 109 /L   ≥  7 days (Grade 4) 

The prophylactic use of cytokines is discouraged in conjunction with the first dose of 
CAELYX, but their use is endorsed in subsequent cycles under specific circumstances: in 
patients with prolonged neutropenia (Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days, or failure of 
ANC to recover within 22 days); or the occurrence of febrile neutropenia in a prior cycle 
of treatment. 
 
Once reduced, the dose level should not be increased for the duration of the patient’s 
subsequent treatment on this study.

4.3.2.3  Bilirubin 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

If the total bilirubin rises to > 1.2 (>20 µmol/L) but < 3.0 mg/dL (<50 µmol/L) in the 
prior cycle, a 25% reduction of the CAELYX dose will be required.  If the bilirubin rises 
to > 3 mg/dL (50 µmol/L) and is considered to be unrelated to CAELYX, the dose of 
CAELYX must be reduced by 50%.  If the elevation of bilirubin to > 3 mg/dL is 
considered to be related to CAELYX, the patient should be withdrawn from the study. 

 

 

 

 

4.3.2.4  Mucositis or Stomatitis  

In the case of oral mucositis (stomatitis), the dosing intervals may be increased if 
necessary for patients to tolerate therapy.  For patients exhibiting Grade 1 stomatitis, 
continue treatment at the same dose at 4-week intervals if the patient has not previously 
experienced Grade 3 or 4 toxicity.  If the patient has experienced a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
that has now resolved to Grade 1, hold study drug for an additional week.   

If Grade 1 toxicity persists when the dose has been delayed for 2 weeks (6 weeks since 
the last dose), then reduce the study drug dose by 25% and continue dosing at 4-week 
intervals.   

If Grade 2 or greater stomatitis toxicity is present on the scheduled day for dosing, hold 
treatment for 1 week.  If the patient still exhibits stomatitis toxicity of Grade 2 or greater 
after treatment has been discontinued for 1 week, hold treatment for an additional week.  
If the patient continues to exhibit Grade 2 toxicity after the dose has been delayed for 
2 weeks (6 weeks since the last dose), then resume treatment at 4-week intervals with 
CAELYX at a 25% reduced dose.   

For Grade 3 and 4 toxicity persisting 2 weeks beyond the next scheduled dose (6 weeks 
since the last dose), discontinue study drug therapy. 

Whenever stomatitis symptoms persist for 6 weeks or longer, the investigator may elect to 
follow the dose modifications outlined above or to withdraw the patient from the study, 
based on the overall risks/benefits analysis.

6.0  Adverse Experiences 

 

6.1  Definitions 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

An adverse event is any unfavorable, harmful or unintended change involving function, 
structure, or chemistry that occurs during the study, regardless of drug relationship, 
including any intercurrent illness, injury, toxicity, sensitivity or sudden death. 

Any new adverse event that was not evident at screening/baseline or that increases in 
intensity or frequency, or changes in character is to be reported on the Adverse Event 
Case Report Form. 

A pre-existing condition is one that is present prior to or at the start of the study and is to 
be reported as part of the patient's medical history.  It should be reported as an adverse 
event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during study 
treatment. 

Lack of efficacy is a worsening of the disease being studied or lack of desired effect of 
the study drug.  If followed as an efficacy parameter, it should not be recorded as an 
adverse event. 

 

6.2  Reporting Adverse Events 

All adverse events that occur at any time during the study, including the post-treatment 
period as defined in the protocol after drug administration is discontinued, are to be 
reported in the patient’s Case Report Forms. 

Each patient will be evaluated by the investigator or study coordinator at each visit during 
the study for any new or continuing symptoms since the previous visit.  Any symptoms 
changing in character or in intensity should be noted.  Any clinically significant adverse 
event reported by the patient or caregiver or noted by the investigator or study coordinator 
will be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form.  The intensity will be 
evaluated, relationship to study drug will be determined, and any necessary management 
will be recorded in the patient's medical record.

Intensity will be evaluated using the following criteria: 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

Mild (Grade 1):  The patient is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated.  
The event is of little concern to the patient and of little clinical significance.  The event is 
not expected to have any effect on the patient’s overall health or well-being. 

Moderate (Grade 2):  The patient has discomfort enough to cause interference with or 
change in usual activities.  The event is of some concern to the patient’s health or 
well-being and may require medical intervention and/or close follow-up. 

Severe (Grade 3):  The adverse event interferes considerably with the patient’s usual 
activities.  The event is of definite concern to the patient and/or poses substantial risk to 
the patient’s health or well-being.  The event is likely to require medical intervention 
and/or close-follow-up and may be incapacitating or life-threatening. Hospitalization and 
treatment may be required. 

Life-Threatening (Grade 4):  The patient is incapacitated.  The event poses substantial 
risk to the patient’s immediate health or well-being. 

Relationship to study drug will be assessed using the following criteria: 

Probably Related:  An event that follows a logical sequence from administration of the 
drug, improvement or disappearance after stopping or reducing the dose, and/or 
reappearance of the event after repeated exposure, or an unusual event that is known to be 
associated with the drug or this class of compound, and cannot be reasonably explained 
by other therapy or the patient's physical condition. 

Possibly Related:  An event that follows a plausible sequence and it is reasonable to 
suspect drug causation after considering basic illness, concurrent illness, concomitant 
medications, and other modes of therapy administered to the patient. 

Probably Not Related:  Any event not meeting the criteria above, and the event is known 
to be associated with the clinical conditions or other medications taken by the patient. 

A clinical laboratory abnormality should be reported as an adverse event only if the 
following conditions are met: 
•  The laboratory abnormality has been confirmed by at least one repeat test, or 
•  The abnormality suggests disease and/or organ toxicity, or

7.0  Health-Related Quality of Life 

 

7.1  Background and Objectives 

The availability of extensively used and psychometrically validated disease-specific 
health-related quality of life (HQL) instruments for the use in ovarian cancer clinical 
trials is limited.  However, several studies have measured the HQL of cancer patients 
with a variety of diagnoses, using the European Organization for the treatment of Cancer 
Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQC-30).29, 30, 31  The limitation of this 
questionnaire is that it is a general cancer HQL instrument.  A disease-specific modular 
approach is recommended and is frequently used in clinical trials.32  Disease-specific 
modules provide a more comprehensive method for the measurement of HQL in patients 
with a specific diagnoses, i.e., ovarian cancer. 

Using the modular approach and to address the specific needs of this study (ovarian 
cancer and CAELYX toxicities).  An ovarian cancer checklist (questions #31-43, 47-53) 
has been developed and used in NCIC.33, 34  In addition to this module, CAELYX side 
effect questions (questions #44-55), as well as a global question of subjective significance 
(question #54) were also included.  The latter was added to aid in interpreting the 
meaning of the degree of change in terms of clinical relevance for global quality of life.  
Because of the intent of this question, Question #54 is only included in all visits after 
baseline assessment.   

The EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 2.0) instrument contains the following HQL dimensions:  
physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, 
social functioning, and global quality of life/health status.  Symptom scales/items include 
questions related to fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, 
appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact.

The objective for collecting quality of life data in this study is to obtain pilot data and 
information about the use of the HQL questionnaire for patients with ovarian cancer, as 
well as monitor this patient population for changes during treatment when compared to 
baseline in measuring the effects of CAELYX on HQL in this clinical trial.  The HQL 
questionnaire is comprised of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 2.0) and the ovarian cancer 
checklist/toxicity questions and subjective significance question (see Appendix VII). 

7.2  Schedule of HQL Evaluations 

 
Patients will complete the HQL questionnaire prior to study entry, every four weeks, at 
the end of treatment visit and at discontinuation.  The HQL questionnaire will be 
completed by the patient on the day of the visit corresponding to the physical exam, prior 
to treatment.  Patients should arrive 20 to 30 minutes earlier to allow time to complete the 
questionnaire in the clinic.  Demographic information will be recorded by the study 
personnel on the HQL questionnaire.  The patient will complete the HQL questionnaire 
while waiting in the reception area to see the physician and before any medical 
assessments are taken.  The HQL questionnaire must be completed at the clinic and not 
taken home for completion. 
 
The investigator is responsible for adherence to this protocol and to the Questionnaire 
Administration Guidelines for Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire (Appendix 
VIII).  HQL questionnaire will be retrieved by the SEQUUS Study Monitor. 
 

7.3  Analysis of HQL Data 

 
Calculation of each HQL domain scale for the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 2.0), and the 
checklist module will be performed according to the scoring guidelines for each of the 
HQL measures.  On treatment changes will be compared to baseline values.

8.0  Study Analysis 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

Pre-study radiographic response evaluations are to be done within the 30-day screening 
phase prior to first dose of study drug.  This screening phase defines the patient’s disease 
state at baseline which will be  compared to subsequent response assessments.  Because 
the primary efficacy endpoint is time to progression, it is imperative that all patients have 
their baseline and subsequent disease assessments completed according to the protocol. 

 

8.1  Definitions of Disease 

 

8.1.1  Measurable Disease:  Bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly 

 
defined margins by 1) plain X-ray with at least one diameter > 0.5 cm (bone lesions are 
not included) or, 2) CT, MRI or other imaging scan with both diameters greater than the 
distance between cuts of the imaging study, or 3) palpation with both diameters > 2 cm. 

 

8.1.2  Evaluable Disease:  Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with 

 
margins not clearly defined, lesions with both diameters < 0.5 cm, lesions on scan with 
either diameter smaller than the distance between cuts, palpable lesions with either 
diameter < 2 cm.  Malignant ascites or pleural effusion in conjunction with serum levels 
of  CA-125 > 100 U/mL in the absence of cirrhosis (see notes on CA-125 in Appendix 
X).  

 

 
by indirect evidence only (e.g. serum tumour markers or other lab values). 

8.1.3  Nonevaluable Disease:  Pleural effusions, ascites, disease documented 

 

 

8.2  Definitions of Response 

If an organ has too many measurable lesions to measure at each evaluation, choose 3 to be 
followed before the patient has entered the study.  The remaining measurable lesions in 
that organ will be considered evaluable for determination of disease status.  All 
measurable and evaluable sites must be assessed using the same methodology as at 
baseline. A durable response must persist for 2 separate measurements taken 4 weeks 
apart. 

 

 
and evaluable disease.  No new lesions.  No disease-related symptoms.   

8.2.1  Complete Response (CR):  Complete disappearance of all measurable

in the sum of the products of bidimensional perpendicular diameters of all measurable 
lesions.  No progression of evaluable disease.  No new lesions.  

8.2.2  Partial Response (PR):  Applies only to patients with a > 50% decrease 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

 

 

 

8.2.3  Stable Disease (SD):  Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression. 

 

8.2.4  Progressive Disease (PD):  A > 50% increase in the sum of the 

 
products of bidimensionally measured lesions over the smallest sum observed (over 
baseline, if no increase), OR reappearance of any lesion which had disappeared, OR clear 
worsening of any evaluable disease, OR failure to return for evaluation due to death or 
deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer), OR appearance of any

clear worsening of disease.  Worsening of existing nonevaluable disease does not 
constitute progression.  See Appendix X for notes on CA-125.

8.4  Stratification 

Eligible patients will be stratified prospectively for platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease 
and analysed retrospectively for prior anthracycline therapy.  Patients who respond to 
initial platinum-based therapy and who have a progression-free interval of greater than 6 
months off treatment are defined as platinum-sensitive.  On the other hand, patients who 
progress during treatment or who have stable disease in response to initial platinum-based 
therapy or who relapse within 6 months of cessation of therapy are considered to have 
platinum-refractory disease. 

Patients will also be stratified on the basis of the presence or absence of bulky disease.  
Bulky disease is defined as the presence of a tumour mass which is greater than 5 cm in 
size. 

Patients will also be analysed  on the basis of whether or not they have received prior 
treatment with anthracyclines.  

 

8.5  Patient Populations 

 

 8.5.2 

 8.5.1  Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT)

 
The ITT Patient Population is defined as all patients who were randomised and received 
at least a partial dose of study drug. 
 
The evaluable patient population is defined as all patients who were randomised, meet the 
enrollment criteria, received at least 2 cycles of study drug, and had at least one response 
evaluation.

Assessment of demographic and baseline characteristics such as age (continuous 
variable), age (< 65yr versus ≥ 65yr), race, Karnofsky performance status (< 80% versus 
≥ 80%), previous therapy (carboplatin versus cisplatin), prior anthracycline therapy (yes 
or no) and ascites (presence or absence), will be done to ensure the comparability 
between the two treatment groups at the time of analysis.  Differences between the two 
treatment groups for categorical data will be tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) tests, adjusting for platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease.  For continuous 
variables, a four-way analysis of variance will be performed with effects of treatment, 
platinum-sensitivity, bulky disease, centre, and all interactions.  Stratified log-rank test 
(stratified by platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease) will be used as the primary analysis, 
and the proportional hazard model will be used as a secondary analysis to test for 
treatment differences in time-to-event data.   

The primary efficacy analysis is a comparison of time to progression between the two 
treatment regimens.  Secondary efficacy analyses include response rates, time to response, 
duration of response, quality of life, and survival.  Statistical analyses will be performed 
on primary and secondary efficacy parameters for the intent-to-treat (ITT) and the 
evaluable patient populations.  All statistical tests in these analyses will be 2-sided for all 
variables except for time to progression variable.  For all variables, an overall 5% level of 
significance will be used for treatment difference, and 10% level for interaction, with 
adjustments for the 2 planned interim analyses (Section 8.7).  

 

 

8.6.2  Time to Progression, Time to Response and Survival Analyses 

The distribution of overall time to event will be estimated for each treatment using the 
Kaplan-Meier method.  The two treatments will be compared using the stratified log-rank 
test as a primary analysis.  The stratified generalized Wilcoxon test will also be provided. 

In addition, the proportional hazard model will be used  to estimate the overall hazard 
ratio (with 95% one-sided confidence interval for time to progression) between the two 
treatment groups and to evaluate the effect of covariates.  The main covariates included in 
this analysis are platinum-sensitivity, Karnofsky performance status, bulky disease, prior 
anthracycline therapy, treatment-free interval after last dose of first-line therapy 
(≤ 6 months, >6 to ≤18 months, and >18 months), age, prior therapy (carboplatin versus 
cisplatin), and the presence or absence of ascites at baseline.  Other covariates may also 
be assessed.

Comparison of response rates (CR + PR) between the two treatment groups will be 
conducted using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis stratified by platinum-sensitivity  
and bulky disease.  The response rates will also be summarized using two-sided 95% 
confidence intervals on the difference in the response rates.  

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57

8.6.4  Duration of Response 

The stratified log-rank statistic will be used for comparison of the duration of response 
curves between the two treatment groups for  responders.  The stratified generalized 
Wilcoxon test will also be provided. 

The proportional hazard model will be used to evaluate the hazard ratio between the 
2 treatment groups and to evaluate the effect of the covariates.  

 

 

 

8.6.5  Statistical Power and Sample Size Considerations 

In a randomised clinical trial, it has been shown that median time to progression is 
18 weeks for  Paclitaxel HCl-treated patients.  We will consider CAELYX to be at least 
as efficacious as Paclitaxel HCl, if the progression-free survival rate of CAELYX at 18 
weeks, is not more than 10% less than that for Paclitaxel HCl  Therefore, the statistical 
hypotheses of interest to test are as follows: 

H0:  SPaclitaxel(18) - SCAELYX(18) ≥ 10% 

versus 

H1:  SPaclitaxel(18) - SCAELYX(18) < 10%,  

where S(18) denotes the progression-free survival rate at 18 weeks. 

Under the proportional hazards model, CAELYX can be considered to be as efficacious 
as Paclitaxel if  

Median time to progression for CAELYX ≥ 18*(ln(.5)/ln(.4)) = 13.62 weeks. 

If the enrollment phase is completed in 24 months, followed by a therapy period of 
6 months to observe for disease response or progression, a total of 334 35 (prob. of failure 
is equal to 0.95) evaluable patients are required, 167 in each treatment group, to assure 

 

 
42 

342 

Doxil:  Clinical Study Report 30-57

CONFIDENTIAL 

 

Doxorubicin HCl Liposome Injection

with a probability of 80% that the lower 95% one-sided confidence limit of the hazard 
ratio of Paclitaxel to CAELYX (or median time to progression ratio of CAELYX to 
Paclitaxel) will not fall below 0.757. 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

There are 2 additional factors to consider that influence the number of patients required.  
Two planned interim analyses will be conducted (Section 8.7), requiring approximately 
5% more patients to be enrolled (i.e. 350 evaluable patients needed).  Second, up to 20% 
of randomised patients may not be evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoints, therefore 
the number of patients needed to be randomised (1:1) is up to 438, depending on 
evaluability rate. 

 

 

8.7  Interim Analysis 

Two interim analyses and a final analysis are planned.  The first and second interim 
analyses will be conducted once 190 and 264 of the evaluable patients have been enrolled 
and all such patients have either experienced disease progression or have been on study 
for at least 6 months. Enrollment will continue while the interim analyses are being 
conducted.  The primary efficacy parameter for the interim analyses is time to 
progression.  The final analysis will be conducted at the end of the study.   

Group sequential approach as presented in the EaSt software 36 with O’Brien Fleming 
type spending function was utilized to determine the appropriate boundaries.  Under this 
design, the nominal α levels are 0.0086, and 0.042 for the first, and the final look at the 
data, respectively (assuming percent disease progression is constant across the time.  At 
the time of the interim analysis, nominal α levels can be re-calculated based on actual 
number of events).  The decision to stop the trial at the interim analysis will be based on 
crossing the rejection boundaries provided in above.  

The actions described below will be taken if: 

1)  H0 can not be rejected in the interim analysis, the study will continue as planned. 

2)  H0 can be rejected and CAELYX can not be shown significantly superior to 

Paclitaxel, in the interim analysis, the study will continue as planned. 

3)  H0 can be rejected and CAELYX can be shown significantly superior to Paclitaxel in 

the interim analysis, then

•  All CRF data will be collected for the patients that comprised the interim analysis. 
•  All secondary analyses will be conducted. 

 
If the results of the secondary analyses confirm that treatment with CAELYX produces a 
favourable outcome compared to Paclitaxel treatment, the following change in study 
design will occur, patients currently in the treatment phase who were randomised to 
receive the Paclitaxel regimen may, at the discretion of the investigator, being to receive 
treatment with CAELYX according to the dose and schedule in the protocol. 

 

8.8  Safety Analyses 

Detailed tabulations of safety data will be provided for all patients who received study 
medication.  Summaries of adverse events and other safety parameters by treatment 
received will also be provided where appropriate .

A copy of the informed consent form must be given to the patient.  The investigator must 
keep each patient’s signed consent form on file for inspection by a regulatory authority at 
any time. 

 

9.3  Drug Accountability 

The investigator will not supply CAELYX to any patient not enrolled in the study, or to 
any physicians or scientists except those designated as co-investigators. 

For sites in Europe, the investigator is expected to comply with the Declaration of 
Helsinki, adopted June, 1964 and amended in Tokyo, October, 1975; Venice, October, 
1983 and Hong Kong, September, 1989 (refer to Appendix IX). 

The investigator must ensure that personnel who administer the study drugs to patients 
understand the dosing procedures.  The investigator or pharmacist will record drug 
distribution on a log form provided with each shipment. 

Each shipment of drug supplies for a study will contain an investigational drug 
Transmittal and Receipt Form to assist the investigator in maintaining current and 
accurate inventory records. 

Records should cover receipt, dispensing, and the return of study drug supplies. 

The investigational Transmittal and Receipt Form will be included routinely for all 
studies, and will identify for each shipment the subject identification code (if applicable), 
the lot number, and the quantity of vials contained in the shipment. 

Upon receipt of the investigational drug, the pharmacist shall visually inspect the 
shipment and verify the number and condition of vials received.  The lower portion of the 
investigational transmittal and receipt form shall be completed and signed by the 
pharmacist.  A copy of the signed form is to be filed with the inventory/drug 
accountability records.  The original completed form is to be mailed back to SEQUUS, in 
the envelope provided with the drug shipment. 

The drug supply will be packaged and shipped in insulated containers. Only authorized 
personnel should have access to the drug.  For accurate accountability, the following 
information must be noted when drug supplies are used during the course of the study:

records must be readily available for inspection by the study monitor and are open to 
FDA inspection at any time. 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

Return of all drug supplies must be coordinated with the Clinical Research Associate 
(CRA) prior to shipment.  When unused drug supplies are to be returned, the pharmacist 
should record the number of vials and lot numbers being returned in their inventory log, 
and complete the Return Authorization Form provided by SEQUUS.  Further instructions 
for return will be provided by SEQUUS. 

Upon completion of this study the investigator and pharmacist should verify and sign that 
all unused drug supplies have been returned and that no drug supplies remain in the 
investigator’s possession.  If all drug supplies are not returned, the investigator and 
pharmacist must include an explanation and document this in the accountability records.  
A copy of the inventory sheets and drug accountability information must be returned to 
the Sponsor at the end of the study.

elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational 
product.  These documents should be retained for a longer period however if required by 
the applicable regulatory requirement(s) or if needed by the sponsor. 

 

9.5  Case Report Forms 

All data will be recorded on Case Report Forms provided by SEQUUS.  All forms must 
be legible and complete.  Blue or black ink must be used in completing these forms. 

All corrections must be initialed and dated by the individual making the correction.  All 
final and corrected Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be reviewed and signed by the 
Principal Investigator.  Corrected copies of CRFs will be filed with the corresponding 
original. 

Case Report Forms will be completed on a timely basis.  The original copy will remain at 
the site until collected by the Clinical Research Associate (CRA). 

 

9.6  Monitoring the Study 

Individual sites will be monitored at appropriate intervals to assure satisfactory 
enrollment rate, data recording, and protocol adherence.  The frequency of monitoring 
may vary depending on enrollment rate and the quality of data collected.  The investigator 
and staff are expected to cooperate with the monitor and provide all relevant study 
documentation in detail at each site visit on request for review by the CRA.  In addition to 
these visits, each site will be routinely monitored by phone to keep abreast of patient 
status and to answer questions. 

 

9.7  Termination of Study 

The Sponsor retains the right to terminate the study and remove all the study materials 
from the study site at any time.  Specific instances that may precipitate such termination 
are:

hazards to the patient.  Any other change will be initiated by the Sponsor in writing in a 
protocol amendment document.  One copy of this protocol must be signed in 
acknowledgment by the investigator and returned to the Sponsor.  If the change in any 
way increases the risk to the patient or changes the scope of the study, the amendment 
must be submitted to the IRB, together with, if applicable, a revised consent form.  If IRB 
approval is required, written documentation of IRB approval must be received by the 
Sponsor before the amendment may take effect. 

 

9.9  Publication Statement 

The results of this clinical trial may be used by SEQUUS in registration documents for 
regulatory authorities in the U.S. or abroad or for public dissemination in the form of 
papers, abstracts, posters, or other informational materials to be presented at scientific 
meetings, or published in professional journals, or as part of an academic thesis by an 
investigator.  In all cases, in order to avoid disclosures that could jeopardize proprietary 
rights and to ensure accuracy of the data, SEQUUS reserves the opportunity to preview 
all manuscripts and abstracts related to this study, allowing SEQUUS sufficient time to 
make appropriate comments prior to submission for publication. 
The final publication of the trial results will be written by the Study Co-ordinator on the 
basis of the statistical analysis performed by SEQUUS.  After revision by the co-authors 
and the Sponsor, a manuscript will be sent to a major scientific journal.  Authors of the 
manuscript will include the Study Co-ordinator, the investigators who have included 
more than 5% of the eligible patients in the trial (by order of inclusion), and the Study 
data manager and statistician in charge of the trial.  Sites contributing more than 20% of 
patients will be entitled to include the name of two authors.  Interim publication or 
presentation of the study may include demographic and toxicity data, but no data on 
activity may be made publicly available before the recruitment is discontinued and all 
responses have been externally reviewed.

Instructions For Drug Storage and 

Administration of CAELYX 

 

 

HOW SUPPLIED 
 
CAELYX is supplied in vials as a liquid.  Each vial contains 20 mg doxorubicin HCl.   
 
Do not use if a precipitate or foreign matter is present. 
 
Do not use if vial seal is breached. 

STORAGE OF MATERIAL 
 
Store CAELYX in a refrigerator at 2° to 8°C.  Avoid freezing. 

 

 

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
 
The vial contains 2.0 mg/mL doxorubicin HCl, unless specified otherwise on the label.  
Determine the volume of CAELYX to be administered (based upon the dose specified in 
the protocol). 
 
Take the appropriate volume of CAELYX up into a sterile syringe.  Aseptic technique 
must be strictly observed since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in 
CAELYX.  Each vial is single use only. 
 
Dilute the CAELYX in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (D5W).  For doses > 12 mg and 
< 90 mg, dilute in 250 mL of D5W.  For doses > 90 mg, dilute in 500 mL of D5W.  Once 
the CAELYX has been diluted it must be kept refrigerated at 2° to 8°C and administered 
within 8 hours of mixing.  Ordinarily, the drug will be administered by intravenous 
infusion over 1 hour.  However, because of occasional acute reactions to the first dose, 
that initial infusion can be administered more slowly if necessary.  Infusion may be given 
through a peripheral vein or a central line.

Appendix III (Continued) 

HANDLING AND DISPOSAL 
 
CAELYX should not be mixed with other drugs until specific compatibility data are 
available.  
 
The presence of any bacteriostatic agent, such as benzyl alcohol, may cause precipitation 
of CAELYX. 
 
Caution should be exercised in handling CAELYX solution. The use of gloves is 
recommended. If CAELYX comes into contact with skin or mucosa, immediately wash 
thoroughly with soap and water. 
 
CAELYX should be handled and disposed of in a manner consistent with other anti-
cancer drugs.

Taxol™ ▼ 
paclitaxel 
 
Presentation  Concentrate  for  Infusion  -  5  ml  vial 
containing  a  sterile,  clear,  slightly  yellow,  viscous 
solution  of  paclitaxel  6  mg/ml.  Other  ingredients: 
Ethanol, Polyethoxylated castor oil. 
 
Uses 
Indications:  The  treatment  of  metastatic  carcinoma  of 
the  ovary  where  standard,  platinum-containing, 
therapy has failed. 
The  treatment  of  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the  breast 
where  standard  anthracycline-containing  therapy  has 
failed or is inappropriate. 
 
Mode of action: Paclitaxel is the first of a class of agents 
that  promote  the  assembly  of  microtubules  from 
tubulin  dimers  and 
stabilise  microtubules  by  
preventing  depolymerisation.  This  stability  results  in 
the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of 
the  microtubule  network  that  is  essential  for  vital 
interphase  and  mitotic  cellular  functions.  In  addition, 
paclitaxel  induces  abnormal    arrays  or  bundles  of 
microtubules    throughout  the  cell  cycle  and  multiple 
asters of microtubules during mitosis. 
 
Pharmacokinetics:   The Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel 
were determined following 3-hour infusions at doses of 
135 and 175 mg/m2. Mean terminal half life estimates 
ranged  from  3.0  to  52.7  hours,  and  mean,  non-
comparatively derived, values for total body clearance 
ranged from 11.6 to 24.0 L/hr/m2, total body clearance  
appeared 
plasma 
concentrations of paclitaxel. Mean steady-state volume 
distribution  ranged  from  198  to  688  L/m2,  indicating 
extensive  extravascular  distribution  and/or  tissue 
binding.  With  the  3-hour  infusion,  increasing  doses 
result  in  non-linear  pharmacokinetics.    For  the  30% 
increase  in  dose  from  135  mg/m2  to  175  mg/m2,  the 
Cmax  and  AUC  0_α  values  increased  75%  and  81% 
respectively. 
 
Intrapatient variability in systemic paclitaxel  exposure 
was minimal. There was no evidence for accumulation 
of paclitaxel with multiple treatment courses. 
 
In  vitro  studies  of  binding  to  human  serum  proteins 
indicate that 89 - 98% of drug is bound. The presence of 
cimetidine, 
or 
diphenhydramine  did  not  affect  protein  binding  of 
paclitaxel.

The  disposition  of  paclitaxel  has  not  been  fully 
elucidated  in  humans.  Mean  values  for  cumulative 
urinary recovery of unchanged drug have ranged from 
1.3 to 2.6% of the dose, indicating extensive non-renal 
clearance.  Hydroxylated  metabolites  have  been 
demonstrated  to  be  the principal metabolites. Hepatic 
metabolism and biliary clearance may be the principal 
mechanism for disposition of the paclitaxel. The effect 
of  renal  or  hepatic  dysfunction  on  the  disposition  of 
paclitaxel  following  a  3-hour  infusion  has  not  been 
investigated  formally.  Pharmacokinetic  parameters 
obtained  from  one  patient  undergoing  hemodialysis 
who  received  a  3-hour  infusion  of  Taxol  135  mg/m2 
were within the range of those defined in non-dialysis 
patients. 
 
Dosage and administration 
All 
patients 
must 
corticosteroids, 
antihistamines  and  H2  antagonists  prior  to  Taxol 
administration,  e.g.  dexamethasone  20  mg  orally 
approximately  12  and  6  hours  before  Taxol, 
chlorpheniramine  10  mg  IV  30  to  60  minutes  prior  to 
Taxol and cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 50 mg IV 30 
to  60  minutes  before  Taxol  (  see  “Contraindications”, 
”Precautions and warnings”) 
 
The  recommended  dose  of  Taxol  is  175  mg/m² 
administered  by  intravenous  infusion  over  3  hours 
with  a  3-week  interval  between  courses,  dependent 
upon  patient 
should  not  be 
readministered until the neutrophil count is at least 1.5 
x 109 /L and the platelet count is at least 100 x 109 /L. 
Patients  who 
neutropenia 
(neutrophil count <0.5 x 109/L for  7 days or more) or 
severe  peripheral  neuropathy  should  receive  a  dose 
reduction of 20% for subsequent courses ( see “Contra-
indications”, ”Precautions and warnings”) 
 
Taxol  must  be  diluted  before  use  and  should  be 
administered  using  non-PVC  containing  equipment 
through an in-line filter with a microporous membrane 
not  greater  than  0.22  µm  (  See  “Pharmaceutical

appropriate supportive equipment should be available. 
Hypotension and bradycardia, generally not requiring 
treatment,  have  been  observed  during  administration. 
Frequent vital sign monitoring, particularly during the 
first hour of infusion, is recommended. 
 
Patients  must  be  pretreated  with  corticosteroids, 
antihistamines  and  H2    antagonists  before  receiving 
Taxol  (see  “Dosage”).  In  clinical  studies,  severe 
hypersensitivity  reactions,  characterised  by  dyspnoea 
and hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema and 
generalised  urticaria  have occurred in less than 2% of 
patients receiving Taxol after adequate premedication. 
These  reactions  are  probably  histamine-mediated.  In

discontinued. Symptomatic therapy should be initiated 
and  the  patient  should  not  be  rechallenged  with  the 
drug.  Minor  hypersensitivity  reactions  do  not  require 
interruption of therapy (see “Side-Effects”). 
Bone  marrow  suppression  (primarily  neutropenia)  is 
the  dose-limiting  toxicity  and  frequent  monitoring  of 
blood  counts  should  be 
instituted  during  Taxol 
treatment.  Patients  should  not  be  retreated  until 
neutrophils  recover  to  a  level  of  >  1.5  x  109/L  and 
platelets  >  100  x  109/L.  Severe  neutropenia  (<  0.5  x 
109/L) occurred in over a quarter of patients in clinical 
studies  but  was  not  associated  with  febrile  episodes, 
with  only  1%  experiencing  severe  neutropenia  for  7 
days or more. 
 
Anaemia has been observed in the majority of patients 
with  the  incidence  and  severity  related  to  baseline 
haemoglobin  status.  Severe  anaemia  (Hb  <8  g/dL) 
occurred 
in  clinical  studies. 
Thrombocytopenia  was  reported  in  a  similar  number 
of subjects, with 3% having a platelet nadir count <50 x 
109/L at least once  while on the study. 
 
Severe  cardiac  conduction  abnormalities  including 
asymptomatic  ventricular 
tachycardia 
with  bigeminy,  atrioventricular  block  and  syncopal 
episodes have been reported rarely. If patients develop 
significant  conduction  abnormalities  during  Taxol 
administration 
should  be 
administered.  Continuous  cardiac  monitoring  should 
be  performed  during  subsequent  courses  for  patients 
with serious conduction abnormalities. 
 
Peripheral 
by 
parasthesia occurs in the majority of patients, although 
the development of severe symptoms is unusual. It can 
occur  following  the  first  course  of  Taxol  and  worsen 
with  increasing  exposure.  In  severe  cases  a  dose

reduction  of  20%  is  recommended  for  all  subsequent 
courses. Sensory symptoms usually improve or resolve 
within  several  months  of  discontinuing  Taxol.  Pre-
existing neuropathies as a result of previous therapies 
are not a contraindication for Taxol therapy. 
 
Taxol  is  not  recommended  in  patients  with  severely 
impaired hepatic function. 
 
The  carcinogenic  potential  of  Taxol  has  not  been 
studied. However, paclitaxel is a potential carcinogenic 
and genotoxic agent, based upon its pharmacodynamic 
mechanism  of  action.  Taxol  has  been  shown  to  be 
mutagenic in both in vitro and in vivo mammalian test 
systems. 
 
Pregnancy  and 
lactation  (see  “Contra-indications”): 
Taxol  has  been    shown  to  be  both    embryotoxic  and 
foetotoxic  in  rabbits  and  to  decrease  fertility  in  rats. 
There is no information on the use of Taxol in pregnant 
women.  As  with  other  cytotoxic  drugs,  Taxol  may 
cause  foetal  harm  when  administered  to  pregnant 
women.  Taxol  is  contra-indicated  during  pregnancy. 
Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant 
during  therapy  with  Taxol  and  to  inform  the  treating 
physician immediately should this occur. 
 
It  is  not  know  whether  Taxol  is  excreted  in  human 
milk. Taxol is contra-indicated during lactation. Breast 
feeding  should  be  discontinued  for  the  duration  of 
Taxol therapy. 
 
Side-effects:  The  events  reported  here  refer  to  patients 
treated in clinical trials carried out worldwide. None of 
the events was significantly influenced by age. 
 
Serious  events  occurring  most  frequently  were  bone 
marrow  suppression  and  peripheral  neuropathy. 
Severe 
severe 
cardiovascular  conduction  abnormalities  occurred 
rarely  (see  “Contra-indications”,  ”Precautions”  and 
“warnings”). 
 
Alopecia occurs in almost all patients receiving Taxol. 
Arthralgia  or  myalgia  affected  60%  of  patients  was 
severe in 13% of patients. 
 
Twenty    four    per  cent  of  patients  had  an  infectious

occurred  in  34%  of  patients  (17%  of  all  courses).  The 
reactions mainly included flushing and rash. 
 
Hypotension and bradycardia occurred in 22% and 5%, 
respectively,  and  were  usually  mild,  requiring  no 
therapeutic  intervention.  17%  of  patients  had  an 
abnormal  ECG.  In  most  cases  there  was  no  clear 
relationship  with  Taxol  therapy  and  the  alterations 
were  of 
little  or  no  clinical  relevance.  Other

cardiovascular  events  occurring 
included 
hypertension,  upper

thrombosis  and 
thrombophlebitis,  hypotension  associated  with  septic 
shock,  cardiomyopathy  and  tachycardia  associated

Drug Interactions 
Paclitaxel  clearance  is    not  affected  by  cimetidine 
premedications. 
 
Data  from  patients  receiving  sequential  infusions  of 
Taxol  and  cisplatin  showed  a  more  profound 
myelosuppression when Taxol was given by prolonged 
infusion  after  cisplatin.  An  approximately  20% 
decrease in paclitaxel clearance was found when Taxol 
was administered following cisplatin.

Pharmaceutical precautions 
Storage:  The  unopened  vials  may    be  stored  between 
15-  25ºC.  The  vials  should  be  protected  from  light.  If 
refrigerated, a precipitate may form which redissolves 
with 
little  or  no  agitation  upon  reaching  room 
temperature.  If  the  solution  remains  cloudy,  or  an 
insoluble  precipitate  is  noted,  the  vial  should  be 
discarded.  Freezing  does  not  adversely  affect  the 
product. 
 
Preparation  of  infusion:  Taxol  must  be  diluted,  using 
aseptic 
to  a  final 
concentration  of  0.3  to  1.2  mg/ml.  Recommended 
diluents are: 
 
09.%  Sodium  Chloride  Intravenous  Infusion  BP  5% 
Glucose 
Infusion  BP  0.9%  Sodium 
Chloride and 5% Glucose Intravenous Infusion BP 
5% Glucose in Ringer’s injection. 
 
The  prepared  solutions  are  physically  and  chemically 
stable  for  up  to  27  hours  (including  preparation  and 
administration) 
temperature 
(approximately  25  ºC)  and  room  lighting  conditions. 
Diluted solutions should not be refrigerated. 
 
Upon preparation, solutions may show haziness which 
is not removed by filtration and which is attributed to 
the formulation vehicle. Taxol should be administered 
through an in-line filter with a microporous membrane 
not  greater  than  0.22  µm.  No  significant  losses  in 
potency  have  been noted followed simulated delivery  
of the solution through i.v. tubing containing an in-line 
filter. 
 
Incompatibilities:  The  Polyethoxylated 
castor  oil 
contained  in  Taxol  can  result  in  phthalate  leaching 
from plasticised polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containers at 
levels  which  increase  with  time  and  concentration. 
Consequently, 
and 
administration  of  diluted  Taxol  should  be  carried  out 
using non-PVC containing equipment. The use of filter 
devices  incorporating  short  inlet  and/or  outlet  PVC 
tubing  has  not  resulted 
in  significant  phthalate 
leaching. 
 
Guidelines for the safe handling of antineoplastic agents: 
 
1. Trained personnel should reconstitute the drug. 
2. This should be performed in a designated area. 
3. Adequate protective gloves should be worn.

4.  Precautions  should  be  taken  to  avoid  contact  with 
the  skin  and  mucous  membranes.  In  the  event  of 
contact with the skin, the area should  be immediately 
and  thoroughly  washed  with  soap  and  water.  In  the 
event  of  contact  with  the  mucous  membranes,  these 
should be flushed thoroughly with water. 
5. The cytotoxic preparation should not be handled by 
pregnant staff. 
6.  Adequate  care  and  precautions  should  be  taken  in 
the  disposal  of  items  (syringes,  needles  etc.)  used  to 
reconstitute cytotoxic drugs. Excess material and body 
waste may be disposed of by placing in double sealed 
polythene  bags  and  incinerating  at  a  temperature  of 
1,000  °C.  Liquid  waste  may  be  flushed  with  copious 
amounts of water. 
7. The work surface should be covered with disposable 
plastic-backed absorbent paper. 
8. Use Luer-lock fittings on all syringes and sets. Large 
bore  needles  are  recommended  to  minimise  pressure 
and the possible formation of aerosols. The latter may 
also be reduced by the use of a venting needle.

Appendix VIII (cont.) 

 
Introduction 
 
Guidelines for administering the Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (HQLQ) 
during this clinical study are presented in this document.  The questionnaire will be 
completed by the patients during their scheduled visits. 
 
These guidelines assume that an appropriate person has been designated to facilitate self-
administration of the questionnaires and enter the data with each investigator's office, and 
that a procedure has been established for recording the patient's initials and identification 
number, visit date, and site code on the questionnaire, as well as reviewing the 
questionnaire for completeness. 
 
Foreign Speaking Patients, Visual Problems 
 
Patients must be able to read the language of their country in order to complete the 
HQLQ.  If a patient is not able to speak the language of their country, check if the patient 
is able to read the language of their country, and if so, give the patient the questionnaire. 
 
The Questionnaire was prepared under the assumption that patients would not have 
problems reading a questionnaire that has normal-size type.  In general, if a clinical study 
is expected to have a large number of patients who have visual problems, a large-type 
version of the questionnaire also should be prepared.  If the questionnaire is to be given to 
a large number of patients who are unable to read, then an interviewer-administered 
version of the form and accompanying script for the interviewer must be developed.   
 
When Should the Questionnaire Be Administered? 
 
The Questionnaire should be administered before the patient sees the physician, so that 
the interaction between the patient and physician will not influence the patient's answers 
to the questionnaire.  Ideally, the questionnaire also should be administered before the 
patient is asked about adverse experiences and concurrent illnesses, again so that any 
discussions of health problems do not influence the patient's answers to the questionnaire.  
It is important that the Questionnaire be administered and the adverse event questions be 
asked in the same order in all study sites.

Appendix VIII (cont.) 

 
 
How Should the Questionnaire Be Introduced? 
 
A sample script for introducing the questionnaire is given below.  This is one possible 
script that could be used.  Staff members at each study site can reword this script so that it 
sounds more like their natural style of speech and fits the setting of the clinical site. 
 
“Your doctor would like to better understand how you and other patients in this study 
feel, how well you are able to do your usual activities, and how you rate your health.  To 
help us understand these things about you and other patients better, please complete this 
questionnaire about your health. 
 
The questionnaire is easy to fill out.  The instructions are on the front cover [point to 
them].  You should read each question and then circle the appropriate number that 
matches your answer.  Remember, this is not a test and there are no right or wrong 
answers.  Choose the answer that best describes the way you feel.  I will quickly review 
your questionnaire when you are done to make sure that all the questions have been 
answered. 
 
You should answer these questions by yourself.  Spouses or other family members should 
not help you when you answer the questionnaire.  I will be nearby in case you want to ask 
me any questions.  Please return the questionnaire to me when you are done.” 
 
What To Do if the Patient Asks for Clarification of Survey Items 
 

Some patients may ask what specific questions mean.  If this happens, the staff 

member can assist the patient by rereading the question for them verbatim.  If the patient 
asks what something means, do not try to explain what the question means, but tactfully 
suggest that the patient use their own interpretation of the question.  All patients should 
answer the questions based on what they think the questions mean, or the study results 
may be biased.

Questionnaire Completion 
 

Study Protocol:  SEQU-30-57 
Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

 

When the patient returns the questionnaire, check that all the questions have been 
answered.  If the questionnaire is not complete, tell the patient that some of the questions 
weren't answered.  If the patient does not quickly volunteer to answer these items, ask the 
patient whether she had any difficulty completing the questionnaire. 

If the patient says that she had trouble understanding a question, ask the patient why  she 
had difficulty with that item.  Reread the question for her verbatim, but do not attempt to 
explain or reword the question, as explained before.  If the patient is still unable to 
complete the question, accept the questionnaire as incomplete. 
 
Some patients may be confused by the response choices.  They may want to respond with 
"I don't know" or some other response choice that is not on the questionnaire.  If that 
happens, try to tactfully help the patient choose one of the response categories by saying 
something like:  "I know it may be hard for you to pick an answer, but which of these 
answers do you think comes closest to the way that you are thinking or feeling?"  If the 
patient still can't select an answer, accept the questionnaire as incomplete. 
 
Occasionally, patients may not report having difficulty with a question or with the 
response choices, but still may hesitate or refuse to answer an item or items.  If this 
happens, accept the questionnaire as incomplete. 
 
For questions that are incomplete, please indicate for that question, directly on the 
questionnaire “patient prefers not to answer”. 
 
The questionnaire should also be reviewed for these common errors; should the patient 
still be unable to select a single answer, then the following rules will apply: 
 
(1) 

If a respondent circles two responses and the responses are adjacent to each other, 
choose the lower number. 

 
(2) 

 

 

If a respondent circles two responses for an item and they are not adjacent to each 
other, code the lower number.

(5) 

If a respondent circles three or more responses for an item, code that item 
“missing”. 

If a respondent answers the “yes/no” items by writing in “yes” or “no”, code the 
answer as though “yes” or “no” had been circled. 

If a respondent places a circle or mark between two responses, code the lower 
number. 

 
Please review the specific DOs and DON'Ts of Questionnaire Administration in Table 1.  
If a patient asks for interpretation of their responses or asks for their score on the 
questionnaire, tell respondents that you are not trained in how to score or interpret the 
questionnaire.  Emphasize that their answers are to be kept confidential. 
 
Completed Questionnaires 
In general, when questionnaires like the SF-36 or EORTC QLQ-C30 are administered in 
clinical settings, the patient is thanked once she has completed the questionnaire and the 
staff member has checked it for completeness.  A draft script for thanking the patient is 
provided below.  Again, the staff member should reword this to sound like their natural 
speech. 
 
“Thank you for taking the time to complete this survey.  We will be asking you to 
complete this survey again during this study.” 
 
Depending on the visit week, the second sentence can be modified to say the number of 
additional times the survey will be administered, or to say that this is the last time that the 
survey will be administered.  Because the patient is providing other information during 
her visit, a specific thank you for completing the HRQL Questionnaire may not be 
appropriate in this study. 
 
Physician/Staff Review of Questionnaires 
 
The physician should not be allowed to review the questionnaire.  Physicians may be 
interested in knowing the results for their patients, especially if they know that quality of 
life questionnaires are currently being used in some physician's practices.  However, 
allowing the physician to review the survey introduces a potential bias into the study,

since a physician might discuss the results with patients or somehow influence patient's 
answers on subsequent administrations of the survey.  Even if a physician does not mean 
to do this, the potential for inadvertently doing so exists. 
 
Staff members who administer the questionnaire and enter the data also should not 
discuss the results with patients.  If a patient asks about her results, the staff member 
should say that the results are being analyzed as part of the study and that staff members 
at the individual sites cannot interpret the results.  The patient also could be reminded that 
the Questionnaire is not a test and that there are no right or wrong answers. 
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting and QOL Assessment 
 
Site personnel should not attempt to reconcile QOL responses and adverse events, unless 
specifically instructed by protocol.

Declaration of Helsinki 

 

Recommendations guiding medical doctors in biomedical research involving human 
subjects 
 
Adopted  by  the  18th  World  Medical  Assembly,  Helsinki,  Finland,  June  1964  and 
amended  by  the  29th  World  Medical  Assembly,  Tokyo,  Japan,  October  1975  the  35th 
World  Medical  Assembly,  Venice,  Italy,  October  1983  and  the  41st  World  Medical 
Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
It  is  the  mission  of  the  physician  to  safeguard  the  health  of  the  people.  His  or  her 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this mission. 
 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with 
the world, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International 
Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the patient's interest 
when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and 
mental condition of the patient". 
 
The  purpose  of  biomedical  research  involving  human  subjects  must  be  to  improve 
diagnostic,  therapeutic  and  prophylactic  procedures  and  the  understanding  of  the 
aetiology and pathogenesis of disease. 
 
In  current  medical  practice  most  diagnostic,  therapeutic  or  prophylactic  procedures 
involve hazards. This applies especially to biomedical research. 
 
Medical  progress  is  based  on  research  which  ultimately  must  rest  in  part  on 
experimentation involving human subjects. 
 
In the field of biomedical research a fundamental distinction must be recognized between 
medical research in which the aim is essentially diagnostic or therapeutic for a patient, 
and  medical  research,  the  essential  object  of  which  is  purely  scientific  and  without 
implying direct diagnostic of therapeutic value to the person subjected to the research.

APPENDIX IX  (cont.) 

 
Special  caution  must  be  exercised  in  the  conduct  of  research  which  may  affect  the 
environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 
 
Because  it  is  essential  that  the  results  of  laboratory  experiments  be  applied  to  human 
beings to further scientific knowledge and to help suffering humanity, the World Medical 
Association has prepared the following recommendations as a guide to every physician in 
biomedical research involving human subjects. They should be kept under review in the 
future. It must be stressed that the standards as drafted are only a guide to physicians all 
over  the 
  world.  Physicians  are  not  relieved  from  criminal,  civil  and  ethical 
responsibilities under the laws of their own countries. 
 
I - BASIC PRINCIPLES 
 
1.  Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted 
scientific  principles  and  should  be  based  on  adequately  performed  laboratory  and 
animal experimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature. 

 
2.  The  design  and  performance  of  each  experimental  procedure  involving  human 
subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be 
transmitted  for  consideration,  comment  and  guidance  to  a  specially  appointed 
committee  independent  of  the  investigator  and  the  sponsor  provided  that  this 
independent committee is in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country 
in which the research experiment is performed. 

 
3.  Biomedical  research  involving  human  subjects  should  be  conducted  only  by 
scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent 
medical  person.  The  responsibility  for  the  human  subject  must  always  rest  with  a 
medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even though 
the subject has given his or her consent. 

 
4.  Biomedical  research  involving  human  subjects  cannot  legitimately  be  carried  out 
unless  the  importance  of  the  objective  is  in  proportion  to  the  inherent  risk  to  the 
subject.

Protocol Draft:  March 13, 1997 

APPENDIX IX  (cont.) 

 
5.  Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by 
careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the 
subject or to others. Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over 
the interests of science and society. 

 
6.  The  right  of  the  research  subject  to  safeguard  his  or  her  integrity  must  always  be 
respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject and 
to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and 
on the personality of the subject. 

 
7.  Physicians  should  abstain  from  engaging  in  research  projects  involving  human 
subjects  unless  they  are  satisfied  that  the  hazards  involved  are  believed  to  be 
predictable.  Physicians  should  cease  any  investigation  if  the  hazards  are  found  to 
outweigh the potential benefits. 

In  publication  of  the  results  of  his  or  her  research,  the  physician  is  obliged  to 
preserve the accuracy of the results. Reports of experimentation not in accordance 
with  the  principles  laid  down  in  this  Declaration  should  not  be  accepted  for 
publication. 

In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed 
of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the 
discomfort it may entail. He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to 
abstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw his or 
her  consent  to  participation  at  any  time.  The  physician  should  then  obtain  the 
subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. 

 
10.  When  obtaining  informed  consent  for  the  research  project  the  physician  should  be 
particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship to him or her or may 
consent  under  duress.  In  that  case  the  informed  consent  should  be  obtained  by  a 
physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent 
of this official relationship.

11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal 
guardian  in  accordance  with  national  legislation.  Where  physical  or  mental 
incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a 
minor,  permission  from  the  responsible  relative  replaces  that  of  the  subject  in 
accordance  with  national  legislation.    Whenever  the  minor  child  is  in  fact  able  to 
give a consent, the minor's consent must be obtained in addition to the consent of the 
minor's legal guardian. 

 
12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration 
are complied with.

1. 

In  the  treatment  of  the  sick  person,  the  physician  must  be  free  to  use  a  new 
diagnostic  and  therapeutic  measure,  if  in  his  or  her  judgement  it  offers  hope  of 
saving life, reestablishing health or alleviating suffering. 

 
2. 

 
3. 

 
4. 

 
5. 

 
6. 

 

 

The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed 
against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 

In  any  medical  study,  every  patient  -  including those of a control group, if any - 
should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. 

The  refusal  of  the  patient  to  participate  in  a  study  must  never  interfere  with  the 
physician-patient relationship. 

If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific 
reasons  for  this  proposal  should  be  stated  in  the  experimental  protocol  for 
transmission to the independent committee (I, 2.). 

The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective 
being  the  acquisition  of  new  medical  knowledge,  only  to  the  extent  that  medical 
research is justified by its potential diagnostic or therapeutic value for the patient.

III  -  NON-THERAPEUTIC  BIOMEDICAL  RESEARCH  INVOLVING  HUMAN 

SUBJECTS (Non-clinical biomedical research) 

In  the  purely  scientific  application  of  medical  research  carried  out  on  a  human 
being, it is the duty of the physician to remain the protector of the life and health of 
that person on whom biomedical research is being carried out. 

The subjects should be volunteers - either healthy persons or patients for whom the 
experimental design is not related to the patient's illness. 

The  investigator  or  the  investigating  team  should  discontinue  the  research  if  in 
his/her or their judgement it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual. 

 
In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over 
considerations related to the well-being of the subject.

CA 125 Progression 38, 39 

 
Disease progression defined by CA 125 relies on a patient having at least 3 serial CA 125 
levels.  One of the criteria listed below must be fulfilled. 
 
A. 
 

Patients with the CA 125 of ≤ 30 U/ml following chemotherapy  

Progression will be defined as an increase in CA 125 to greater than 60 U/ml that 
is confirmed by a second sample that is also greater than 60 U/mL. The time to 
progression will be measured from the date of the first dose of trial therapy to the 
date of the first sample greater than 60 U/mL. 
 
Patients with CA 125 ≥ 30 U/ml following chemotherapy 

B. 
 

 

Progression according to CA 125 has occurred if there has been either a 
25% increase over two previous samples which is confirmed by a fourth sample. 
or a 50% increase over 3 samples. 
The time to progression will be measured from the date of the first dose of trial 
therapy  to  the  date  of  the  first  sample  showing  a  25%  increase  in  the  25% 
definition, or third  sample confirming a 50% increase in the 50% definition. 
 
or  persistent  elevation  over  100  U/ml  for  more  than  2  months  without  a  50% 
decrease.  
 
To be reliable enough for use in clinical trials, these definitions need to take into 
account natural variations in CA 125 levels, upper limits of normal, lower limits 
of accuracy and missing samples.  Precise definitions therefore use mathematical 
logic and have been incorporated into a computer programme which will be used 
in this study.  The precise definitions are as follows:-  
 
Criteria 1 
Sample one = x 
Sample two = y 
Sample three>125% x and y and > 40 U/mL 
Sample four > 90% sample three 
(If there are any intervening samples between samples

two and three they must be > 90% sample two) 
 
Criteria 2 
Sample one = x 
Sample two ≥ 125% of x and > 30 U/mL 
Sample three ≥ 125% sample two and ≥ 40 U/mL 
(If there are any intervening samples they must be  
>90% of previous sample) 
 
Criteria 3 
Sample one ≥ 100 U/ml 
Sample two ≥ 50% sample one and ≥ 100 U/mL 
Sample three ≥ 90% sample two and ≥ 100 U/mL and 
≥ 56 days must have elapsed between samples one and  
three.  (Any intervening samples must be ≥ 50% sample  
one and ≥ 100 U/mL).

Amendment # 1A 

A Phase III, Randomised, Open-Label Study of CAELYX versus 
Paclitaxel HCl in Patients with Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma 
Following Failure of First-Line, Platinum-Based Chemotherapy 

 
 
Rationale for Clinical Changes: 
Some of the study sites are unable to perform the MUGA scans therefore 
echocardiography is allowed at these centres as a means of assessing cardiac function. 
The criteria for assessing the relationship of the study drug to an adverse experience was 
revised to reflect current SEQUUS standard criteria. 

After consultation with Dr. 
(NCIC) concerning the Health-related Quality of 
Life Questionnaire, we have amended the content of the questions to reflect symptoms 
seen within this group of patients and to look more closely at side effects that may be 
encountered.

Probably Related:  An event that follows a logical sequence from 
administration of the drug, improvement or disappearance after 
stopping or reducing the dose, and/or reappearance of the event after 
repeated exposure, or an unusual event that is known to be associated 
with the drug or this class of compound, and cannot be reasonably 
explained by other therapy or the patient's physical condition. 
Possibly Related:  An event that follows a plausible sequence and it is 
reasonable to suspect drug causation after considering basic illness, 
concurrent illness, concomitant medications, and other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient. 
Probably Not Related:  Any event not meeting the criteria above, and 
the event is known to be associated with the clinical conditions or 
other medications taken by the patient. 
Related:  The drug is reasonably suspected as the cause of the event 
after considering basic illness, concurrent illness, concomitant 
medications, and other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
In addition, the event follows a logical sequence from administration 
of the study drug as follows.  The event improves or disappears after 
stopping or reducing the dose, and/or reappears after additional drug 
exposure; or the event is an unusual event that is known to be 
associated with the drug or this class of compound, and cannot be 
reasonably explained by other therapy or the patient's physical 
condition.

After… “with a specific diagnosis, i.e., ovarian cancer.”: 
Using the modular approach and to address the specific needs of this 
study (ovarian cancer and CAELYX toxicities).  An ovarian cancer 
checklist (questions #31-43, 47-53) has been developed and used in 
NCIC.33, 34  In addition to this module, CAELYX side effect questions 
(questions #44-55), as well as a global question of subjective 
significance (question #54) were also included.  The latter was added 
to aid in interpreting the meaning of the degree of change in terms of 
clinical relevance for global quality of life.  Because of the intent of 
this question, Question #54 is only included in all visits after baseline 
assessment. 
Using the modular approach and to address the specific needs of this 
study (ovarian cancer and /CAELYX toxicities), an ovarian cancer 
checklist (questions #31-35) has been developed and used by the 
NCIC.33,34 In addition to this module, CAELYX side effect questions 
(questions#46-48), as well as paclitaxel HCl side effect questions 
(questions#36-37), and general chemotherapy side effects questions 
(questions#38-45) have been added. There are four other questions 
featured in this questionnaire. The first concerns sexual activity 
(question#49), the second and third concern pain control 
(questions#50-51). The final question is a global question of subjective 
significance (question#52). This was added to aid in interpreting the 
meaning of the degree of change in terms of clinical relevance for 
global quality of life. Because of the intent of this question, 
question 52 is only included in all visits after the baseline visit.

Rationale for Clinical Changes: 
The significance level for the second interim analysis was not included in the original 
protocol.  In addition, the timing of the first interim analysis was changed to more closely 
coincide in time with the first interim analysis of a companion phase III study conducted 
by SEQUUS (SEQUUS-30-49).  Interim analysis results from the two studies will 
provide information needed for an examination of study design assumptions, and more 
generally, future product development plans.
