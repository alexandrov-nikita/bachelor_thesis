XRP6258/EFC6193 
 

Main selection criteria: 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Inclusion Criteria: 
The Patient must have: 
1.  Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically proven prostate 
adenocarcinoma, that is refractory to hormone therapy and 
previously treated with a Taxotere® (or docetaxel)-containing 
regimen.  Patient must have documented progression of disease 
during or within 6 months after prior hormone therapy and 
disease progression during or after Taxotere® (or docetaxel)-
containing therapy. 

2.  Patient must have either measurable or non-measurable 

disease. 
• 

Patient with measurable disease must have documented 
progression of disease by RECIST criteria demonstrating 
at least one visceral or soft tissue metastatic lesion 
(including new lesion).  This lesion must measure at least 
10 mm in the longest diameter (or two times the slice 
thickness) on spiral CT scan or MRI (chest, abdomen, 
pelvis) or 20 mm on conventional CT or Chest X-ray for 
biopsy proven, clearly defined lung lesion surrounded by 
aerated lung. (Previously irradiated lesions, primary 
prostate lesion, and bone lesions will be considered non-
measurable disease) 
Patient with non-measurable disease must have 
documented rising PSA levels or appearance of new 
lesion. [Rising PSA is defined as at least two consecutive 
rises in PSA to be documented over a reference value 
(measure 1) taken at least one week apart. The first rising 
PSA (measure 2) should be taken at least 7 days after the 
reference value. A third confirmatory PSA measure is 
required (2nd beyond the reference level) to be greater than 
the second measure and it must be obtained at least 7 
days after the 2nd measure. If this is not the case, a fourth 
PSA measure is required to be taken and be greater than 
the 2nd measure. The third (or the fourth) confirmatory 
PSA should be taken within 4 weeks prior to 
randomization]

Main selection criteria: 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Inclusion Criteria (con’t.): 
3.  Received prior castration by orchiectomy and/or Luteinizing 

Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LH-RH) agonist with or without 
antiandrogen, antiandrogen withdrawal, monotherapy with 
estramustine, or other hormonal agents.  (A prior treatment by 
antiandrogen is not mandatory.  However, if the patient has been 
treated with antiandrogens, and PSA is above 5 ng/mL at the 
last administration of antiandrogens, presence or absence of 
antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome* should be confirmed prior to 
the study entry).  (LH-RH agonist treatment should continue 
during the study treatment period.  Chlormadinone acetate or 
flutamide must have been stopped at least 4 weeks prior to, 
while bicalutamide must have been stopped at least 6 weeks 
prior to, the last PSA evaluation.)  (* The antiandrogen 
withdrawal syndrome is a decrease in PSA seen upon stopping 
an antiandrogen such as chlormadinone acetate, flutamide, or 
bicalutamide; this occurs because the antiandrogen has induced 
a mutation in the androgen receptor which is allowing the 
antiandrogen to stimulate prostate cancer growth rather than 
inhibit it) 

4.  Life expectancy > 2 months 
5.  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 

status (PS) 0 – 2 (ie, patient must be ambulatory, capable of all 
self-care, and up and about more than 50% of waking hours)

one dose of a bone-seeking radio-isotope ( samarium-153, 
strontium-89, or P-32) is allowed, but 8 weeks must have 
elapsed after samarium-153 or P-32 and 12 weeks must have 
elapsed after strontium-89 prior to first study drug administration.

Route(s) of administration: 

Dose regimen: 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

XRP6258 (RPR116258) 
XRP6258 is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, non-aqueous 
yellowish to brownish yellow, 80 mg/2 mL concentrate for solution for 
infusion. It is packaged in 15 mL single dose clear type I glass vial 
stoppered with a rubber closure. The stopper is crimped to the vial 
with a green flip-off aluminum cap.  The solution contains the 
following excipient: Polysorbate 80. 
Solvent:  
The solvent for XRP6258 is supplied as a 13 % m/m ethanol solution 
in water for injection.  This solvent is supplied in a 15 mL single dose 
clear type I glass vial stoppered with a rubber closure and capped 
with a transparent flip-off aluminum cap. 
The preparation of the XRP6258 (RPR116258) infusion solution for 
administration requires preparation of a premix solution at 80 mg/8 
mL (nominal concentration).  This must be done with a 13 % m/m 
ethanol solution in water for injection supplied with the XRP6258 
concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Each XRP6258 vial and each solvent vial are overfilled to ensure 
that 80 mg dose can be extracted after the preparation of the premix.  
Each vial of XRP6258 must be diluted with the ENTIRE content of 
the solvent vial. 
XRP6258 and mitoxantrone will be administered by IV route.   
Prednisone will be administered by oral route. 
Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 
mitoxantrone or XRP6258 every 3 weeks:  
Arm A:  Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m² intravenously (Day 1) every 3 

weeks, plus prednisone 10 mg orally given daily 

Arm B:  XRP6258 25 mg/m² intravenously (Day 1) every 3 weeks, 

plus prednisone 10 mg orally given daily 

On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive either XRP6258 at a 
dose of 25 mg/m2, administered by IV route in 1 hour along with 10 
mg of prednisone orally given daily or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 within 
15 –30 minutes, administered by IV route along with 10 mg of 
prednisone orally given daily. 
Cycle length for both XRP6258 and mitoxantrone is 3 weeks.  New 
cycles of therapy may not begin until ANC ≥1500/mm3, platelet count 
≥75 000/mm3, and non-hematological toxicities (except alopecia) 
have recovered to baseline. A maximum of 2 weeks delay is allowed 
between 2 treatment cycles. Patients should come off study 
treatment, if treatment delay is more than 2 weeks.  Patients will be 
monitored closely for toxicity. In addition to optimizing supportive 
care, chemotherapy doses may be adjusted after the first cycle of 
therapy and/or recovery to grade ≤1.  Each patient will be treated 
until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity or for a 
maximum of up to ten cycles. 
Arm B Only: Required IV premedication will include: Antihistamine 
(dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg, diphenhydramine 25 mg or other 
antihistamines); steroid (dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent steroid).

PRIMARY ENDPOINT (S) AND MAIN 
SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S) 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

H2 antagonist (Ranitidine or other H2 antagonist with the exception 
of cimetidine).  These premedications will be administered by IV 
infusion, at least 30 minutes prior to each dose of XRP6258. 
Antiemetic prophylaxis with ondansetron, granisetron, or dolasetron 
can be administered whenever it is necessary. 
Premedication for Arm A should be at the discretion of the physician.   
As in Arm B, pre-medication with a H2 antagonist (Ranitidine or other 
H2 antagonist with the exception of cimetidine) is recommended. 
Antiemetic prophylaxis with ondansetron, granisetron, or dolasetron 
can be administered whenever it is necessary. 
Primary End-point: 
•  OS will be assessed from the date of randomization to the date of 

death (whatever the cause).   
Main Secondary End-points: 
•  PSA Response (Applies to patients with baseline PSA ≥20 

ng/mL): Response requires a PSA decline of ≥50% confirmed by 
a second PSA value at least three weeks later. The duration of 
PSA response will be measured from the first to the last 
assessment at which the above criteria are satisfied. 

•  PSA Progression (Applies to all patients):  

In PSA non-responders, progression will be defined as a ≥25% 
increase over the nadir (provided that the increase in the absolute 
value PSA level is at least 5 ng/ml), confirmed by a second value 
at least 1 week later. 
In PSA responders and in patients not evaluable for PSA 
response at baseline, progression will be defined as a ≥50% 
increase over the nadir (provided that the increase in the absolute 
value PSA level is at least 5 ng/ml), confirmed by a second value 
at least 1 week later. 

•  Progression Free Survival: PFS will be evaluated from the date 

of randomization to the date of tumor progression, PSA 
progression, pain progression, or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first.

PRIMARY ENDPOINT (S) AND MAIN 
SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S) 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Main Secondary End-points (con’t.): 
•  Overall Response Rate (in patients with measurable disease): 

Objective responses (CR and PR) for measurable disease as 
assessed by investigators according to RECIST criteria.  
Confirmation of objective responses will be performed by repeat 
tumor imaging (CT scans, MRI, bone scans) at least 4 weeks after 
the first documentation of response 

•  Pain Response (applies only to patients with median PPI ≥2 
on McGill-Melzack scale and/or mean Analgesic Score (AS) 
≥10 points at baseline):  Pain Response will be defined as a 2-
point or greater reduction from baseline median PPI with no 
concomitant increase in analgesic score, OR a reduction of at 
least 50% in analgesic use from baseline mean AS (only in 
patients with baseline mean AS ≥10) with no concomitant increase 
in pain. Either criterion must be maintained for two consecutive 
evaluations at least 3 weeks apart. 

•  Pain Progression (applies to all patients): Pain Progression will 

be defined as an increase of ≥1 point in the median PPI from its 
nadir noted on two consecutive three-week-apart visits OR ≥25% 
increase in the mean analgesic score compared with the baseline 
score and noted on two consecutive three-week-apart visits OR 
requirement for local palliative radiotherapy.  Patients should only 
be discontinued from study treatment for cancer-related pain 
progression (ie, pain progression supported by clinical and/or 
radiological  evidence of disease progression).

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE 

 

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Safety Data: 
Vital signs, physical examinations (PEs), ECOG PS, ECG, LVEF, 
and laboratory safety tests [including complete blood counts (CBCs) 
and serum chemistries] will be obtained prior to drug administration 
and at designated intervals throughout the study. Adverse events 
(AEs) will be collected and graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 
3.0 (NCI CTCAE v.3.0) during the study. 
Efficacy Data: 
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed by computerized tomography 
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole body (chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis) and by bone scan, at baseline.  These 
assessments, other than bone scan, will be repeated at the end of 
each even-numbered treatment cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10), 
whenever disease progression is suspected, and at the end of 
treatment/withdrawal visit, using the same method for each 
assessment.  Bone scans will only be performed at these visits if 
clinically indicated.  PSA and pain assessments will be performed in 
all patients at baseline and then periodically at scheduled intervals, 
whenever disease progression is suspected, and at the end of 
treatment/withdrawal visit. 
During the first 6 months of the follow-up period, patients who went 
off study treatment prior to documented disease progression will be 
evaluated by CT/MRI for tumor progression every 6 weeks from End 
of Study Treatment until disease progression or start of other 
anticancer therapy.  For rest of the follow-up period, patients will be 
evaluated every 3 months.  Bone scan will be performed during the 
follow-up period when clinically indicated.  In addition, during the first 
6 months of the follow-up period, patients will be evaluated every 6 
weeks for PSA and/or pain progression until documented 
progression or start of other anticancer therapy.  For the rest of the 
follow-up period, patients will be evaluated every 3 months. 
Pharmacokinetic data:  
In Arm B, blood samples will be collected according to a sparse 
sampling strategy in as many patients as possible during Cycle 1 
and in 25 of these patients at Cycle 2. 
Statistical hypotheses and sample size calculation: 
Assuming the median overall survival time in the control group is 8 
months, then total of at least 511 deaths in two arms will be needed 
to detect a 25% reduction in hazard rate in XRP6258 group relative 
to the control with a power of 90% at a 2-sided 5% alpha level. To 
achieve the targeted number of deaths, approximately 720 (360 per 
arm) patients need to be randomized for the study.  
Randomization: 
All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two 
groups (either mitoxantrone or XRP6258 every 3 weeks) using an 
interactive voice response system (IVRS). Randomization will be 
stratified for measurability of disease per RECIST criteria 
(measurable vs. non-measurable disease) and ECOG PS (0-1 vs. 2).

DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD 
(per patient) 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

• 

All-Treated (AT) population: This population includes all patients 
who took at least one dose of the study drug. This population is 
for safety analyses. All analyses using this population will be 
based on the treatment actually received. 

Analysis of the primary endpoint: 
Primary analysis will consist of Overall Survival (OS) comparison 
between the two treatments through a log-rank test procedure 
stratified by stratification factors (measurability of the disease and 
ECOG PS) as specified at the time of randomization. This analysis 
will be performed on the ITT population.  If death is not observed 
during the study, data on OS will be censored at the date patient is 
known to be alive or at the cut-off date, whichever comes first. 
The estimates of the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence 
interval will be provided using a Cox proportional hazard model 
stratified by the same stratification factors as those used for the log-
rank test described above. 
The survival curves will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. 
Interim Analysis (IA): 
An interim (futility) analysis of PFS (either tumor progression, PSA 
progression, or pain progression, as defined above, or death from 
any cause) will be performed after 225 PFS events have occurred, 
ie, 33% information fraction at an estimated cut-off of 12 months 
after 1st patient has been randomized. Approximately 360 patients 
will have been accrued when futility analysis is performed.  
This interim analysis (IA) will be used to estimate the probability that 
the null hypothesis of no treatment differences will be rejected upon 
completion of the trial. Early termination for futility will be considered 
if the conditional power of observing a significant effect at the end of 
the study, assuming the current trend continues, is less than 10%. 
The futility analysis on PFS is not considered an interim analysis on 
the primary endpoint of overall survival and the final p-value for the 
analysis of overall survival will not be adjusted. 

The second interim analysis will be performed at the time of the 307 
deaths  (the  60%  of  the  511  deaths  in  the  final  analysis  of  the 
protocol) to assess the primary efficacy endpoint of overall survival 
based  on  the  O’Brien-Fleming  type  I  error  spending  function.  The 
statistical significance level at the interim analysis will be 0.0076 for 
the 2-sided stratified log rank test. In case the stopping criteria are 
not  met  at  the  time  of  this  second  interim  analysis  the  study  will 
continue and the final overall survival analysis will be performed with 
the 2-sided stratified log rank test at the 0.0476 significance level. 
 
Each patient will be treated until disease progression, death, 
unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of up to ten cycles (30 
weeks), and then will have long-term follow-up until death or for a 
maximum follow-up of up to 2 years (104 weeks).

Assessment must be performed prior to registration (rather than prior to initial dose) for eligibility determination. 
End of study treatment assessment to be performed within 30 days (+ 3 days) after the last study drug infusion. 
In patients that have progressed or started another anticancer therapy, performed every 3 months for a maximum of 2 
years.  In patients that have not progressed or started another anticancer therapy, performed every 6 weeks for first 6 
months and then every 3 months for rest of the period (a maximum total of 2 years). 

Day 1: Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day 1 of the study) refers to the day the patient receives the initial dose of study medication. The Cycle 1 Day 1 
Assessments noted in the Study Schedule are not required if acceptable screening for the assessment is performed within 5 days prior to 
the start of treatment with study drug. However, all of these assessments must be performed for subsequent cycles (eg, Cycle 2 Day 1, 
Cycle 3 Day 1, etc.). Day 1 of each subsequent cycle is defined by the date that study drug administration is started within that cycle. 
Patients must be seen by the responsible physician on Day 1 of each cycle 

b  Medical & Oncologic History: including: diagnosis; prior surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, hormonal therapy, concurrent illness; 

history of allergy. 
Physical Examination: Examination of major body systems including vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate), height 
(Screening only), body weight, and ECOG PS. Results will be recorded on appropriate CRFs (eg, medical/tumor history, adverse events). 
Hematology:  CBC, Diff., Platelets will be assessed on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of every treatment cycle and repeated when clinically 
indicated.  There is a –3-day window allowed at Day 1 and a ±1 day window allowed at Day 8 and Day 15. 
Biochemistry:  Total bilirubin, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, BUN, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride 
and bicarbonate will be assessed on Day 1 of every treatment cycle and repeated when clinically indicated.  There is a –3-day window 
allowed at Day 1 of every treatment cycle. 
ECG: To be performed at baseline and end of study.  Additional tests should be performed if clinically indicated. 
Randomization: Patient treatment arm will be assigned by an IVRS after investigator confirmation of eligibility

BSA, Study Drug Administration, Dispensing, and Accountability:  At the start of each treatment cycle, the patient’s BSA will be 
determined using the current weight and screening height.  Study drug will be administered in the clinic. 
Pain Assessment and analgesic diary: Pain will be assessed using the McGill-Melzack Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scale and Analgesic 
Score (AS) derived from analgesic consumption in morphine equivalents. 
Adverse Event Assessment:  The period of observation for collection of adverse events extends from the time of the first dose of the 
study drug until 30 days after the final dose of study drugs.  Serious adverse events should be followed as described in the protocol. All 
AEs/SAEs that were considered related to study medication and are ongoing at the end of treatment must be followed to resolution and 
recorded in the CRF, as applicable.  New onset study drug related SAEs in FUP should be reported as described in the protocol and 
recorded in the CRF. 
Assessment of Concomitant Medications and Treatments: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 30 days 
prior to the initial dose of study drugs until 30 days after the final dose of study drugs.  In FUP, only further anti-cancer therapies will be 
recorded on the CRF. 
Tumor Assessment:  
• 

CT or MRI of the whole body (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) to be performed in all patients at baseline (screening).  Repeat at the end 
of every other cycle (2, 4, 6, and 8), whenever disease progression is suspected, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit, using 
the same method for each assessment. 
Bone Scan will be performed in all patients at baseline and should be repeated when clinically indicated. 
PSA will be performed at baseline and every cycle.  PSA response will be evaluated at the end of every other cycle (2, 4, 6, and 8), 
whenever disease progression is suspected, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit. 
Pain will be assessed at baseline and every cycle.  Pain response will be evaluated only in those patients with median PPI ≥2 on 
McGill-Melzack scale and/or mean Analgesic Score ≥10 points at baseline.  Pain response will be evaluated at the end of every cycle, 
whenever disease progression is suspected, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit. 

Post-Study Therapy and Survival Status: During the first 6 months of the follow-up period, patients who went off study treatment prior to 
documented disease progression will be evaluated by CT/MRI for tumor progression every 6 weeks from End of Study Treatment until 
disease progression or start of other anticancer therapy.  For rest of the follow-up period, patients will be evaluated every 3 months.  Bone 
scan will be performed during the follow-up period when clinically indicated.  In addition, during the first 6 months of the follow-up period, 
patients will be evaluated every 6 weeks for PSA and/or pain progression until documented progression or start of other anticancer therapy.  
For the rest of the follow-up period, patients will be evaluated every 3 months.  
LVEF:  To be assessed via MUGA or echocardiogram in all patients at baseline.  For the mitoxantrone treatment arm only, to be repeated 
prior to every other treatment cycle, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit using the same method of assessment at all time points.  
Additional tests should be performed if clinically indicated.  For the XRP6258 treatment arm, LVEF should be repeated if clinically indicated.  
Pharmacokinetic sampling: In the XRP6258 treatment arm, blood samples will be collected using sparse sampling strategy in as many 
patients as possible in Cycle 1 and in 25 of these patients in Cycle 2.

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 

4.1  BACKGROUND 

Prostate cancer is a major worldwide health problem and is the most frequently diagnosed male 
malignancy. It is the most common cancer in humans with 232,000 new cases diagnosed in the 
US each year and a similar incidence in the rest of the Western Hemisphere. (1).  The initial 
treatment for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate consists of androgen ablation, either 
surgically with bilateral orchiectomy, or medically with Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing 
Hormone (LHRH) receptor agonists (2). Responses are observed in up to 85 % of patients (3). 
However, this androgen ablation is not curative and the disease will eventually recur in virtually 
all patients. At this stage, further hormonal manipulations such as treatment with antiandrogens, 
and subsequent antiandrogen withdrawal (4) can be associated with responses of short duration 
but without improvement in survival duration (5).  Treatment options for patients with hormone-
refractory disease remain limited and include palliation of symptoms (especially pain) and/or 
systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy (3). 

The use of cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been routine practice whereas the role for 
chemotherapy in symptom palliation and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) response is established.  
Single agent chemotherapy has been associated with relevant palliative effects but no single agent 
has been associated with an objective response rate greater than 30% (6).  Combinations of 
cytotoxic agents have been tested with evidence of frequent enhanced activity in terms of 
palliation and PSA decline (3, 5, 6) but the safety profile of these combinations remains 
problematic, especially in elderly men with concurrent medical problems and limited bone 
marrow reserve.  No survival advantage can be ascribed to any of the treatments tested in these 
studies. More effective systemic therapies are needed to have an impact on the morbidity and 
mortality caused by this disease (7). 

Until recently the therapeutic options for such patients were limited to cyclophosphamide, 
anthracyclines (doxorubicin and mitoxantrone), and estramustine (combination alkylating agent 
and hormone); the efficacy of these regimens was relatively modest.  Taxotere® in combination 
with prednisone was approved in 2004 for the treatment of androgen independent metastatic 
prostate cancer patients and demonstrated a 2.4 month survival benefit compared to mitoxantrone 
plus prednisone, prolonging survival from 16.5 months to 18.9 months.  Standard of care in 
second line prostate is evolving following the adoption of Taxotere® as standard first line therapy 
for Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC).  Palliative effects have been observed in HRPC 
patients following the administration of either corticosteroid alone (8) or, mitoxantrone with either 
prednisone or hydrocortisone (9, 10, 11, 12). Supportive care, with various non-approved agents 
with limited activity is currently used in this setting, palliation being the main goal of therapy.  
Based on results from two phase III trials, the combination of mitoxantrone with corticosteroid is 
recognized as the reference treatment in metastatic HRPC (6, 11, 12).

There is a strong need for new therapies based on novel methods of inhibiting cancer growth.  
There is uniform agreement that responses in advanced prostate cancer are difficult to assess due 
to the heterogeneity of the disease and the lack of consensus on response criteria complicates the 
evaluation of new treatments (13). Many patients with metastatic prostate cancer do not have 
measurable disease but have symptoms dominated by osseous metastases. PSA as a measure of 
disease outcome in metastatic HRPC has emerged as an acceptable surrogate endpoint to evaluate 
new agents in this clinical setting (13, 14, 15). There is also some evidence of correlation between 
PSA response and survival based upon retrospective data but a cause and effect relationship 
remains to be confirmed through prospective investigations. Very recently, eligibility and 
response guidelines for phase II trials in HRPC have been established by the PSA Working Group 
in an attempt to promote common standards for reporting PSA decline and to develop a common 
approach to outcome analysis (16). 

In an attempt to provide an accurate picture of the potential therapeutic benefit of new treatments, 
it has been recommended that different types of response to therapy should be reported separately: 
these include changes in PSA, measurable disease, bone-only disease, quality of life, pain control. 
This method seems preferable to pigeonholing heterogeneous responses into categories of 
complete or partial (13).  These progresses in the standardization of outcome analysis and 
reporting should contribute to the refinement of the assessment of the risk/benefit ratio of new 
cytotoxic agents in HRPC (5, 13, 16). 

The broad spectrum of XRP6258 efficacy in pre-clinical models, and subsequent clinical activity 
observed in early clinical trials along with data in patients with breast cancer progressing after 
taxane therapy suggest that it may also be effective in other tumors where other taxanes have been 
shown to be active.  It is also suggested that XRP6258 would be useful especially in cancers that 
have progressed after taxane therapy, and probably in settings where taxane resistance is present. 

4.2 

XRP6258 

XRP6258 is a new taxoid, which promotes tubulin assembly in vitro and stabilizes microtubules 
against cold-induced depolymerization as efficiently as docetaxel. In vitro, XRP6258 
demonstrates equipotent cytotoxic activity of docetaxel. 

4.2.1  XRP6258 Preclinical activity 

In vivo, XRP6258 has a broad spectrum of antitumor efficacy including efficacy on measurable 
diseases in tumor models of murine and human origin. A trend for schedule-dependency was 
observed with maximum tolerated dosages 4.8-fold higher with an intermittent schedule than with 
a split dose schedule. The best antitumor efficacy was obtained with the schedules allowing the 
administration of the highest amount of drug.  

Compared to other taxoids on the market, the striking feature of XRP6258 is its minimal 
recognition with the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein. Using CaCo-2 cell lines, which express 
a basal level of P-glycoprotein, XRP6258 was found 4.9 times more active than docetaxel. Using 
cell lines with acquired resistance to doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel and 
docetaxel, the resistance factors ranged from 1.8 to 10 and 4.8 to 59, for XRP6258 and for

docetaxel, respectively. This weak recognition of XRP6258 by the P-glycoprotein in vitro is also 
supported by the antitumor efficacy observed in vivo against B16 melanoma which expresses low 
levels of mdr1 mRNA and is resistant to docetaxel. In addition, XRP6258 was found active in 
vivo against intracranial glioblastomas confirming blood brain barrier penetration.  

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

XRP6258 is formulated in polysorbate 80 and premedication is required to prevent allergic-like 
reactions which were noted in phase I studies. These adverse events are predictable and clinically 
manageable, and are similar to those experienced with docetaxel. The incidence of nail changes, 
fluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) seems to be less frequent than that observed 
for docetaxel, and the premedication required to prevent allergic reactions is less than that 
recommended for docetaxel (1 day of antihistamines vs. 3 days of corticosteroids). 

4.2.2  Clinical Activity of XRP6258: Available Results 

As of April 2006, 4 clinical studies have been completed. Three single-agent dose and schedule 
finding studies in solid tumors (V101-103) were conducted to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of XRP6258 in patients with advanced solid 
tumors. These studies of XRP6258 in solid tumors have demonstrated a promising safety profile 
and early clinical activity especially in patients with breast cancer, sarcoma, and prostate cancer 
(2 responses). A total of 77 patients were treated with approximately 241 cycles of the treatment. 

Doses of 10-30 mg/m2 were administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks in studies V-
101 and 103.  The MTD in study V-101 was 30 mg/m2, while it was 25 mg/m2 in study V-103.  
The DLTs were grade 4 neutropenia>5 days and febrile neutropenia in V-101 while grade 3 
diarrhea at 15 mg/m2 and febrile neutropenia and grade 4 neutropenia > 5 days at 25 mg/m2 were 
DLTs in study V-103.  1.5-12 mg/m2 doses were administered as a one-hour infusion weekly for 4 
weeks followed by one-week rest in study V-102.  The MTD in study 102 was 12 mg/m2 while 
the DLT was grade 3 diarrhea.   

Major treatment emergent adverse events reported regardless of relationship in these phase 1 
studies were:

Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred with similar frequency in study V-101 and V-102 (42.9 
and 45.2%, respectively), while they occurred in 24% of patients in study V-103.  The most 
common SAE was febrile neutropenia and most of the SAEs occurred in 1or 2 patients.  In study 
V-101, two patients withdrew from the study due to neutropenic infection and peripheral 
ischemia, and 17 deaths were reported, all due to disease progression.  In study V-102, eight 
patients withdrew due to adverse events (2 asthenia, 1 sensory neuropathy, 1 diarrhea, 1 
peripheral edema, 1 dysuria/hematuria, 1 bile duct obstruction, and 1 elevated transaminases), and 
15 deaths were reported, all due to disease progression, except one death due to pneumonia.  In 
study V-103, no patient withdrew from the study due to adverse events, and 22 deaths were 
reported, all due to disease progression. 

Because of differing MTD reached in studies, the dose of 20 mg/m² administered every 3 weeks 
as a one-hour intravenous (IV) infusion (with a possible intra-patient escalation to 25 mg/m2 at 
Cycle 2, in absence of toxicity >grade 2 during the first 3 weeks) was initially selected for further 
development.  

Subsequently a Phase II study (Study 2001) was performed in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
patients who were resistant to prior taxane therapy given either as adjuvant therapy (Stratum 1) or 
as first-line or second-line therapy (Stratum 2).  Safety and anti-tumoral activity were assessed at 
the dose of 20 mg/m² every 3 weeks at the first cycle, with possible intra-patient escalation to 25 
mg/m2 at Cycle 2 was allowed in the absence of any toxicity grade>2 at Cycle 1. A total of 71 
patients were treated with a total of 345 cycles of treatment in Arm A.  Two (2) CR and 8 PR 
were observed in as treated patients with an overall response rate (ORR) of 14.1%.  The response 
rates were 14.6% and 9.5% in stratum 1 and stratum 2, respectively.  The median time to 
progression (TTP) was 2.7 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 12.3 months.  With 
the exception of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (73% in the overall population), the other adverse 
events were considerably lower compared to docetaxel. 

Major treatment emergent adverse events reported regardless of relationship in this phase II study 
were:

In this study, 29.6% of patients reported serious adverse events; most common SAEs were 
hypersensitivity reaction (4.2%), and infection without neutropenia (4.2%).  Four patients 
withdrew from the study due to non-fatal adverse events (2 elevated transaminases, 1 hepatitis, 1 
hypersensitivity reaction), while 52 deaths were reported during the study, 50 of them were due to 
disease progression, 1 patient died due to unknown cause, while the other died due to shock with 
respiratory failure. 

4.2.3  Clinical PK of XRP6258: Preliminary Available Results 

Human pharmacokinetics of XRP6258 have been investigated during the Phase I studies. 

Following 1h IV infusion, every 3 weeks, no major deviation to the dose proportionality has been 
observed from 10 to 30 mg/m². The terminal half-life was about 70 hours (62h in study V-101 and 
77h in V-103 study). The total plasma clearance (CL) was high, with value of 27 L/h/m² in V-103 
study and of 45 L/h/m² in V-101 study. The volume of distribution was large and quite similar in 
both studies (2034 and 2484 L/m², in studies V-103 and V-101, respectively).  

After weekly administration (study V-102) some accumulation in the deep distribution 
compartment, consistent with the long elimination half-life, appears to occur with a 40% increase 
in AUC (0-t) after the fourth administration of Cycle 1, but with no increase in Cmax. However, no 
difference in exposure has been observed between the first administrations of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 
or in the 3-weekly schedule. 

Metabolism investigations with unlabelled drug after a one-hour infusion (IV) were carried out in 
8 patients at 20 mg/m² on Cycle 2 (Day 21) in study V-103. The main circulating metabolite was 
RPR123142, with a mean metabolic ratio compared to parent drug of 0.196. 

The ex vivo human plasma protein binding of XRP6258 was moderate to high (91.6%), in 
agreement with the in vitro data. The main cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in human 
XRP6258 biotransformation are CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with further CYP2C8. Based on in vitro 
data, inhibition of CYP3A4 in vivo cannot be excluded. 

4.3  RATIONALE 

Based on a very good pre-clinical activity, a favorable safety profile in addition to the early 
activity observed in prostate cancer (2 responses out of seven prostate cancer patients treated were 
observed in phase I studies) and taxane resistant MBC patients, clinical development of XRP6258 
is focused on late stage metastatic disease where the primary objective of treatment with cytotoxic 
agents is to provide palliation treatment as the ability of these patients to tolerate chemotherapy is 
limited due to adverse events. 

The two phase III randomized studies conducted using mitoxantrone with prednisone suggest that 
there is palliative benefit from the addition of mitoxantrone to corticosteroids in the extent and 
duration of pain control in these hormone-refractory patients. However, there is no evidence of 
prolongation of survival.  The combination mitoxantrone-corticosteroids are now considered as

the reference combination to treat HRPC patients. Mitoxantrone combined with prednisone has 
been approved in the United States (US) for the treatment of pain related to HRPC.

4.3.1  Rationale for Dose Selection 

Because of differing MTD reached in phase I studies, the dose of 20 mg/m² administered every 3 
weeks as a one-hour intravenous infusion was selected initially for further clinical development, 
with a possible intra-patient escalation to 25 mg/m2 at Cycle 2, in absence of toxicity >grade 2 
during the first 3 weeks.  One partial response was observed in study V-103 at the 25 mg/m2 dose.  
In a Phase II MBC (study ARD6191), safety and anti-tumoral activity were assessed at the dose of 
20 mg/m² every 3 weeks at the first cycle, with possible intra-patient escalation to 25 mg/m2 at 
Cycle 2 allowed in the absence of any toxicity grade >2 at Cycle 1.  A total of 21 patients were 
treated at the 25 mg/m2 dose after the 1st cycle with a favorable safety profile. The 25 mg/m² dose 
may provide more optimum dose intensity and potentially increase clinical benefit.  Dose 
reduction will be permitted in the protocol in case a patient experiences grade 2 or worse toxicity. 

4.3.2  Rationale for Pharmacokinetics 

In vitro experiments with human microsomes have shown that XRP6258 is metabolized by both 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 2C8 and 3A4/5 [17]. Prednisone was found to be a significant 
inducer of CYP3A4/5 in vitro [18]. Plasma samples will be collected at Cycle 1 in as many 
patients as possible at Cycle 1 in order to assess the PK profile in this population, assuming no 
effect of the day of administration of prednisone on PK of XRP6258. In addition, 25 patients who 
have already been sampled for PK at Cycle 1 will be sampled for PK evaluation at Cycle 2 in 
order to assess the effect of repeated administrations of prednisone on the PK of XRP6258. 
 

It should be noted that the total plasma clearance of docetaxel (CYP3A4 substrate and lower 
plasma clearance than XRP6258 one) was not modified by repeated administration of prednisone 
in the same combination with prednisone (10 mg daily administration of prednisone) for the 
treatment of HRPC  [19].

STUDY DESIGN 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

6.1  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 

This is a phase III, randomized, open-label, multi-center, multinational study. 

The randomization will be performed by an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). 
Randomization between the two treatment arms will be stratified using the following factors: 
•  Measurability of disease per RECIST criteria (measurable vs. non-measurable disease), and  
•  ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2). 

A dynamic allocation method will be used to avoid extreme imbalance of treatment assignment 
within a center. 

6.2  DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 

Each patient will be treated until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity or for a 
maximum of up to ten cycles (30 weeks).  Each patient will have long-term follow-up until death 
or for a maximum of up to 2 years (104 weeks). Maximum study duration including long-term 
follow-up for each patient will be about 134 weeks.  

6.3 

STUDY COMMITTEES  

An executive steering committee will be formed of 2-3 clinical experts in the prostate cancer field 
and representatives of the trial sponsor.  The committee will provide scientific input and advice 
regarding the scientific content of the protocol and the study conduct.  The committee will meet 
periodically at a scheduled interval. Roles and responsibilities will be described in the charter for 
the committee.  

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be set up with the objective to review 
trial enrollment, compliance to protocol, safety of the administered treatments, and quality of the 
data.  The IDMC will consist of two external independent physicians and a statistician not 
associated with the conduct of the study.  This committee will convene periodically at a scheduled 
interval to review safety and other issues related to the appropriate conduct of the trial as well as 
efficacy at the occasion of the interim futility analysis. IDMC procedures will be detailed in the 
IDMC charter and approved by the IDMC members.

SELECTION OF PATIENTS 

This study will enroll hormone resistant metastatic prostate cancer patients who were previously 
treated with a Taxotere® (or docetaxel)-containing regimen. 

7.1  NUMBER OF PATIENTS PLANNED 

The study will enroll approximately 720 patients (360 in each arm) at approximately 150 study 
centers in United States, Canada, European Union, and in other selected countries in the Rest of 
the World (ROW). 

7.2 

INCLUSION CRITERIA 

Inclusion Criteria: 

The Patient must have: 
1  Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, that is refractory 

to hormone therapy and previously treated with a Taxotere® (or docetaxel)-containing 
regimen.  Patient must have documented progression of disease during or within 6 months 
after prior hormone therapy and disease progression during or after Taxotere® (or docetaxel)-
containing therapies. 

2  Patient must have either measurable or non-measurable disease. 

−  Patient with measurable disease must have documented progression of disease by RECIST 

criteria demonstrating at least one visceral or soft tissue metastatic lesion (including new 
lesion).  This lesion must measure at least 10 mm in the longest diameter (or two times the 
slice thickness) on spiral CT scan or MRI (chest, abdomen, pelvis) or 20 mm on 
conventional CT or Chest X-ray for biopsy proven, clearly defined lung lesion surrounded 
by aerated lung. (Previously irradiated lesions, primary prostate lesion, and bone lesions 
will be considered non-measurable disease) 

−  Patient with non-measurable disease must have documented rising PSA levels or 

appearance of new lesion. [Rising PSA is defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA 
to be documented over a reference value (measure 1) taken at least one week apart. The 
first rising PSA (measure 2) should be taken at least 7 days after the reference value. A 
third confirmatory PSA measure is required (2nd beyond the reference level) to be greater 
than the second measure and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure. If 
this is not the case, a fourth PSA measure is required to be taken and be greater than the 
2nd measure. The third (or the fourth) confirmatory PSA should be taken within 4 weeks 
prior to randomization] 

3  Received prior castration by orchiectomy and/or Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone 
(LH-RH) agonist with or without antiandrogen, antiandrogen withdrawal, monotherapy with 
estramustine, or other hormonal agents.  (A prior treatment by antiandrogen is not mandatory.

However, if the patient has been treated with antiandrogens, and PSA is above 5 ng/mL at the 
last administration of antiandrogens, presence or absence of antiandrogen withdrawal 
syndrome* should be confirmed prior to the study entry).  (LH-RH agonist treatment should 
continue during the study treatment period.  Chlormadinone acetate or flutamide must have 
been stopped at least 4 weeks prior to, while bicalutamide must have been stopped at least 6 
weeks prior to, the last PSA evaluation.)  (* The antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome is a 
decrease in PSA seen upon stopping an antiandrogen such as chlormadinone acetate, 
flutamide, or bicalutamide; this occurs because the antiandrogen has induced a mutation in 
the androgen receptor which is allowing the antiandrogen to stimulate prostate cancer growth 
rather than inhibit it) 

4  Life expectancy >2 months 
5  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 – 2 (ie, patient must be 

ambulatory, capable of all self-care, and up and about more than 50% of waking hours)

8.4 

PREPARATION OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 

The preparation of the XRP6258 (RPR116258) infusion solution for administration requires the 
preparation of a premix solution at 80 mg/8 mL (nominal concentration).  This must be done with 
a 13 % m/m ethanol solution in water for injection (the “solvent”) supplied with the XRP6258 
concentrate for solution for infusion (“preparation of the premix solution”).  Then the premix 
solution must be diluted in an infusion vehicle (“preparation of the infusion solution”) prior to 
administration. 

a)  Preparation of the premix solution under aseptic conditions 

Set aside the required number of solvent vials (one solvent vial for each vial of XRP6258).  For 
each XRP6258 vial: 

If the drug product vial is stored under refrigerated conditions, it should stand one hour at room 
temperature before preparation of the premix and the refrigerated solution may be hazy.   
•  Using a syringe fitted with a needle, withdraw the ENTIRE CONTENTS of the solvent vial 

and inject it into the corresponding vial of XRP6258. 

•  The addition of the ENTIRE CONTENTS of one solvent vial ensures a minimal extractable 

volume of the premix solution of 8 mL, containing 10 mg/mL of XRP6258. 

•  Remove the syringe and needle and shake the mixture manually for at least 15 seconds.

XRP6258/EFC6193 
 
•  Allow the premix solution to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature and then check that the 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

solution is homogeneous and clear. It is normal for foam to persist after this time period. 

The premix solution contains 10 mg/mL of XRP6258. 

b)  Preparation of the infusion solution under aseptic conditions 

WARNING: Since foam is normally present, the required dose must be accurately adjusted 
using a graduated syringe. 
•  Aseptically, with a syringe and needle, withdraw the volume of the premix solution containing 

10 mg/mL of XRP6258 that corresponds to the required dose (mg) for administration of 
XRP6258 
Inject the required premix volume into a 125 or 250 or 500 mL infusion container (containing 
either 5% glucose solution or 0.9% sodium chloride solution). 

• 

The concentration of the infusion should be between 0.012 mg/mL and 0.252 mg/mL [based 
on Maximum Tolerated Dose of 30 mg/m² and a Body Surface Area (BSA) of 2.1 m²].  
•  Mix the contents of the infusion container manually using a rocking motion. 

Therefore: 

If the quantity of XRP6258 to administer is between 1.5 mg and 31.5 mg, use a 125 mL infusion 
container,  

If the quantity of XRP6258 to administer is between 31.6 mg and 63 mg, use a 250 mL infusion 
container, 

If more than 63 mg of XRP6258 is required, use a larger volume of infusion vehicle (ie, 500 mL). 

c)  Infusion conditions 

The recommended infusion duration is one hour. The infusion solution should be used within 8 
hours (including the one hour infusion time) and administered at room temperature under normal 
lighting conditions. 

Infusion bags and infusion administration set made of PVC-free material should be used. 

Glass bottles could also be used. 

In line 0.22 µm filter made of PVC-free material should be used. 

d)  Storage period of premix and infusion solution 

The premix solution of XRP6258 should be used immediately after preparation. 

The infusion solution is stable for 8 hours from preparation to end of infusion.

e)  Recommendation for safe handling 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

XRP6258 is an anti-neoplastic agent and, like other potentially toxic compounds, caution should 
be exercised in handling and preparing XRP6258 solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. 

If XRP6258 concentrate, premix solution, or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, 
wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If XRP6258 concentrate, premix solution, 
or infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and 
thoroughly with water. 

MITOXANTRONE 

The mitoxantrone should be administered according to its labeling. Please refer to package insert. 

PREDNISONE 

The prednisone should be administered according to its labeling. Please refer to package insert. 

8.5  DOSING REGIMEN 

There will be centralized randomization (1:1) and patients will be stratified for measurability of 
disease per RECIST criteria (measurable vs. non-measurable disease) and ECOG PS (0-1 vs. 2) 
for the following treatment assignment: 

Arm A:  Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m² intravenously (Day 1) every 3 weeks, plus prednisone 10 

mg orally given daily 

Arm B:  XRP6258 25 mg/m² intravenously (Day 1) every 3 weeks, plus prednisone 10 mg 

orally given daily 

On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive either XRP6258 at a dose of 25 mg/m2, administered 
by IV route in 1 hour, or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2, administered by IV route in about 15-30 
minutes.  In addition, patients in both treatment groups will receive prednisone 10 mg orally daily. 

Cycle length for both XRP6258 and mitoxantrone is 3 weeks.  New cycles of therapy may not 
begin until Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1500/mm3, platelet count ≥75 000/mm3, and non-
hematological toxicities (except alopecia) have recovered to baseline.  A maximum of 2 weeks 
delay is allowed between 2 treatment cycles. Patients should come off study treatment, if 
treatment delay is more than 2 weeks.  Patients will be monitored closely for toxicity. In addition 
to optimizing supportive care, chemotherapy doses may be adjusted after the first cycle of therapy 
and/or recovery to grade ≤1.  Each patient will be treated until disease progression, death, 
unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of up to ten cycles. 

Arm B Only:  Required IV premedication will include an antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine 5 
mg, diphenhydramine 25 mg, or other antihistamine), steroid (dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent 
steroid), and H2 antagonist (Ranitidine or other H2 antagonist with the exception of cimetidine).  
These premedications will be administered by IV infusion, at least 30 minutes prior to each dose

of XRP6258. Antiemetic prophylaxis with ondansetron, granisetron, or dolasetron can be 
administered whenever it is necessary.  

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Premedication for Arm A should be at the discretion of the physician.   As in Arm B, pre-
medication with a H2 antagonist (Ranitidine or other H2 antagonist with the exception of 
cimetidine) is recommended. Antiemetic prophylaxis with ondansetron, granisetron, or dolasetron 
can be administered whenever it is necessary. 

8.5.1  Dose Modifications  

General Rules 

Every effort will be made to administer the full dose regimen to maximize dose-intensity. 

If possible, toxicities should be managed symptomatically. If toxicity occurs, the appropriate 
treatment will be used to ameliorate signs and symptoms including antiemetics for nausea and 
vomiting, antidiarrheals for diarrhea, and antipyretics, and/or antihistamines for drug fever. 

Dose reduction 

Dose can be reduced to 20 mg/m2 for XRP6258 and 10 mg/m2 for mitoxantrone when necessary 
as described below. The dose, which has been reduced for toxicity, must not be re-escalated.  
Only one dose reduction will be allowed per patient. If a second dose reduction is required per the 
modifications below, the patient should go off study. 

Chemotherapy Delay 

A treatment delay ≥4 days should be justified (ie, to be reported in the CRF).  Treatment may be 
delayed no more than 2 weeks to allow recovery from acute toxicity. In case of treatment delay 
greater than 2 weeks, patient should go off study.

8.5.1.2  Allergy (Anaphylactic and Hypersensitivity reactions) 

Mitoxantrone in combination with prednisone (Arm A): No anaphylactic and hypersensitivity 
reactions are expected. However, if a patient experiences such reactions, the same 
recommendations as for the XRP6258 arm apply (see table below). 

XRP6258 in combination with prednisone (Arm B): Hypersensitivity reactions that occur 
despite premedication are very likely to occur within a few minutes of start of the first or of the 
second infusion of XRP6258. Therefore, during the 1st and the 2nd infusions, careful evaluation 
of general sense of well being and of blood pressure and heart rate will be performed for at least 
the first 10 minutes, so that immediate intervention would occur in response to symptoms of an 
untoward reaction. 

Facilities and equipment for resuscitation along with the medications (ie, antihistamine, 
corticosteroids, aminophylline, and epinephrine) must be immediately available.  If a reaction 
occurs, the specific treatment that can be medically indicated for a given symptom (eg, 
epinephrine in case of anaphylactic shock, aminophylline in case of bronchospasm, etc.) will be 
instituted. In addition, it is recommended to take the measures listed below:

Section 8.5 when study drug is reinfused more than 3 
hours after the interruption 

•  Administer study drug over 2 hours for all subsequent 

infusions. 
If a severe reaction recurs, patient will go off protocol 
therapy 

• 

NO FURTHER PROTOCOL TREATMENT 

A prophylactic anti-emetic treatment should be given to the patients in Arm B in all cycles. The 
use of metoclopramide is recommended. More aggressive anti-emetic prophylaxis (ie, 
ondansetron, etc.) should be given to the patient who has experienced grade ≥3 nausea/vomiting 
in a preceding cycle.  If despite the appropriate medication, grade ≥3 nausea/vomiting still occur, 
reduce the dose of study drug. If despite dose reduction, nausea/vomiting still occur at grade ≥3, 
the patient will go off study. 

8.5.1.4  Diarrhea 

No prophylactic treatment for diarrhea is recommended in Cycle 1. However, following the first 
episode of diarrhea, the patient should receive symptomatic treatment with loperamide 4 mg 
orally and then 2 mg orally following each new episode until recovery of diarrhea (no more than 
16 mg daily).  If despite the use of loperamide, grade ≥3 diarrhea still occurs, reduce the dose of 
study drug. If despite dose reduction, diarrhea still occurs at grade ≥3, the patient will go off 
study.

If grade 3 or worse stomatitis occurs, study drug should be withheld until resolution to grade ≤1. 
Treatment may then be resumed, but the dose of study drug should be reduced for all subsequent 
doses.  In case of grade 4 stomatitis, the patient will go off study. 

8.5.1.6  Peripheral neuropathy 

In case of symptoms or signs experienced by the patient, dose modification should be performed 
as follows: 
•  Grade ≤1: No change 
•  Grade 2:  Retreat with reduced dose  
•  Grade 3:  Patient will go off protocol therapy 

8.5.1.7  Liver toxicity 

In case of increase of SGOT and/or SGPT to >1.5 x ULN or bilirubin to >ULN, delay study drug 
treatment for up to 2 weeks until SGOT and/or SGPT returned to ≤1.5 x ULN and bilirubin to 
≤ULN. Then retreat patient at reduced dose for rest of the treatment. 

8.5.1.8  Other Toxic Effects 

For any other toxicity grade 2, manage symptomatically, and retreat without dose reduction. 

If it is grade 3 or worse, study drug administration should be held (except for alopecia) until 
resolution to grade 2, then re-instituted, if medically appropriate, with reduced dose. 

8.5.1.9  Mitoxantrone-induced cardiac toxicity 

The total cumulative dose of mitoxantrone must be restricted to ≤140 mg/m²; electrocardiogram 
(ECG) changes, arrhythmia, tachycardia, and/or chest pain should be managed based on the 
specific findings. 

For monitoring the potential cardiotoxicity of mitoxantrone, all patients randomized to Arm A 
will be followed by MUGA scan or echocardiogram (using same method at all time points) to 
determine the LVEF values according to the following schedule: 
•  Baseline LVEF at rest before registration. 
•  LVEF will be repeated prior to every other treatment cycle, and/or the end of study (EOS) if 

the treatment is discontinued earlier. 

•  Once the treatment is discontinued/completed, LVEF will be repeated every month in patients 
whose LVEF decreased by ≥10% or to a level of <50% (EF units) during the study treatment 
period.  This monitoring may be discontinued once the LVEF has recovered to baseline or the

investigator has deemed it to be chronic/stable and/or to be followed by the primary care 
physician. 

If a patient presents with clinical symptoms suggesting congestive heart failure (ie, shortness of 
breath, tachycardia, cough, neck vein distention, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, etc.), LVEF should 
be repeated earlier to confirm this diagnosis and the patient must be removed from protocol 
treatment. 

The patient should also go off study if there is an absolute decrease in LVEF ≥10% (EF units) 
associated with a decline to a level <50% (EF units) [20]. 

Alopecia and nail changes will not require dose modification. 

8.6  COMPENSATION FOR LACK OF BLINDING 

Primary endpoint of this open label study is overall survival.  All assessments for tumor 
measurement and staging are objective measurements.  In addition, a Steering Committee and 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee will be in place to closely monitor the data and study 
conduct.  These measures will significantly reduce and/or eliminate any bias. 

8.7  METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 

Informed Consent 

An interview will take place involving the patient and the Investigator to determine whether or not 
the patient is eligible to enter the study. 

The patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her disease and must willingly consent 
after being informed of the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, 
alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks, and discomforts.  Human protection committee 
approval of this protocol and a consent form is required. 

If it is determined that the patient is a candidate for the study, the patient (or his legally authorized 
representative) and the Investigator or a specific designee (previously approved by the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)) will sign the informed 
consent form approved by the IRB/IEC of each center following guidelines related to the use of 
human patients in research. 

Randomization Procedures 

If the patient’s characteristics comply with all clinical and laboratory criteria necessary for 
enrollment, the patient may be randomized into the study. 

Once the investigator has verified all eligibility requirements, study site personnel will call the 
IVRS in order to randomize the patient.  The IVRS will assign the patient to a treatment arm and 
if applicable, a PK sampling schedule.  A confirmation will be sent to the investigator to verify

ASSESSMENT OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 

9.1 

EFFICACY 

9.1.1  Primary Criteria 

9.1.1.1  Overall Survival 

Overall survival will be measured in all randomized patients.  Overall survival will be assessed 
from the date of randomization to the date of death (whatever the cause). If death is not 
observed during the study, data on OS will be censored at the earlier of the last date patient 
is known to be alive and the cut-off date. 

9.1.2  Secondary criteria 

9.1.2.1  Prostate-Specific Antigen 

PSA will be assessed during the 28 days prior to first infusion (protocol-defined rising PSA), 
every three weeks during the treatment period (on Day 1 prior to each infusion), at the end of 
study treatment.  In addition, during the first 6 months of the follow-up period, patients will be 
evaluated every 6 weeks for PSA progression until documented progression or start of other 
anticancer therapy.  For the rest of the follow-up period patients will be evaluated every 3 months. 
To ensure comparability, PSA assessments for one patient must be performed in the same 
laboratory from baseline up to the end of the study. 

PSA Response [16]:  Applies to patients with baseline PSA ≥20 ng/mL 

Response requires a PSA decline of ≥50% confirmed by a second PSA value at least three weeks 
later. The duration of PSA response will be measured from the first to the last assessment at 
which the above criteria are satisfied. 

PSA Progression [16]: Applies to all patients 

In PSA non-responders: progression will be defined as a ≥25% increase over the nadir (provided 
that the increase in the absolute value PSA level is at least 5 ng/ml), confirmed by a second value 
at least 1 week later. 

In PSA responders and in patients not evaluable for PSA response at baseline: progression will be 
defined as a ≥50% increase over the nadir (provided that the increase in the absolute value PSA 
level is at least 5ng/ml), confirmed by a second value at least 1 week later.

9.1.2.2  Tumor Lesion Assessment 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Anti-tumor activity will be assessed by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the whole body (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) and by bone scan, at baseline.  
These assessments, other than bone scan, will be repeated at the end of each even-numbered 
treatment cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10), whenever disease progression is suspected, and at the 
end of treatment/withdrawal visit, using the same method for each assessment.  Bone scans will 
only be performed at these visits if clinically indicated.  During the first 6 months of the follow-up 
period, patients who went off study treatment prior to documented disease progression will be 
evaluated by CT/MRI for tumor progression every 6 weeks from End of Study Treatment until 
disease progression or start of other anticancer therapy.  For rest of the follow-up period, patient 
will be evaluated every 3 months.  Bone scan will be performed during the follow-up period when 
clinically indicated. Confirmation of response (CR or PR) must be performed at least 4 weeks 
following the initial response and requires the assessment of all measurable and non-measurable 
disease. 

Summary of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 

Measurability of Tumor Lesions 

At Screening, tumor lesions will be categorized by the investigator as measurable or non-
measurable by RECIST as described below.   

Measurable Disease – the presence of at least one measurable lesion.  If the measurable disease is 
restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed. 

Measurable Lesions – lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
longest diameter ≥20 mm with conventional CT.  With spiral CT, lesion must be ≥10 mm in at 
least one dimension. 
Non-Measurable lesions – all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm 
with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan) and other non-measurable lesions.  
These include:  bone lesions; leptomeningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial effusion; 
inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis; abdominal masses that are not 
confirmed and followed by imaging techniques; and cystic lesions. 

All measurements should be recorded in metric notation by use of a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 

In the present study, lesions in previously irradiated fields cannot be used for the determination of 
response but can be used for the determination of progression.

Methods of Measurements 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 

Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography-including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion-is recommended. 

Lesions on chest X-ray are not acceptable as measurable target lesions.  CT is required. 

CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions 
selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with 
contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm. 

Ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions that are not easily accessible.  It 
may be used as a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable nodes, 
subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination. 

Tumor markers will not be used in the assessment of response. 

Tumor Response Evaluation 

Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” lesions 

All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded 
and measured at baseline. 

Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). 

A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the 
objective tumor response. 

All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required but the presence or absence of each should 
be noted throughout follow-up.

Response Criteria 

Evaluation of target lesions 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. 

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as 
reference baseline sum LD. 

Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references 
the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new 
lesions. 

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. 

Evaluation of non-target lesions 

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. 

Incomplete Response/Stable Disease: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s). 

Progression (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non-target lesions. 

Evaluation of overall response 

The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  In general the patient’s best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  The overall 
assessment of response will involve all parameters as depicted below.

Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment. 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the 
complete response status. 

Frequency of Tumor Re-evaluation 

In the present study, tumor will be re-evaluated every 6 weeks during treatment, and at least 4 
weeks after the first observation of a complete or partial response.  After discontinuation of 
protocol treatment, patients who have not progressed will still be re-evaluated every 6 weeks for 
first 6 months, and then every 3 months, until progression, unless they have started a new anti-
cancer therapy. 

Confirmatory Measurements 

Confirmation 

The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to minimize the risk of overestimation of 
the response rate.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear 
when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed.  In the present 
study, responses always need to be confirmed. 

To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response 
are first met.  Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol may also be appropriate.  In 
the present study, any interval of longer than 4 weeks is appropriate, but it is recommended to use 
a 6 week interval. 

In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study 
entry at a minimum interval defined in the protocol.  In the present study, this interval is 35 days. 

9.1.2.3  Progression-Free Survival  

Progression-Free Survival will be evaluated in all randomized patients. PFS is defined as the time 
between randomization and the date of progression or date of death (due to any cause) where a 
progression is either a PSA progression, or a tumor progression, or a pain progression (pain 
progression must be supported by clinical evidence of disease progression). 

9.1.2.4  Pain  

Pain (PPI and AS) will be assessed prior to every treatment cycle and at the end of study 
treatment visit.   In addition, during the first 6 months of the follow-up period, patients will be

evaluated every 6 weeks for pain progression until documented progression or start of other 
anticancer therapy.  For the rest of the follow-up period, patients will be evaluated every 3 months 
until documented progression or start of other anticancer therapy. 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Pain will be assessed using the Present Pain Intensity scale from the McGill-Melzack 
questionnaire [21].  The patient will be asked to complete the PPI every day for the one-week 
period prior to each evaluation.  The questionnaire should be administered before any treatment 
infusion occurs. If treatment is delayed, the assessment schedule should be defined from the 
actual date of beginning of treatment.  Median PPI is calculated from the PPI values over the one-
week prior to treatment. 

Pain will also be assessed using an Analgesic Score derived from analgesic consumption (in 
morphine equivalents).  The patient will be asked to record all analgesic use for the one-week 
period prior to each evaluation.  Mean Analgesic Score is calculated as the mean daily score of 
analgesics, averaged over the prior week, using the table described in Appendix G: 

 

Pain response (applies only to patients with median PPI ≥2 on McGill-Melzack scale and/or 
mean Analgesic score ≥10 points at baseline) will be defined as a 2-point or greater reduction 
from baseline median PPI with no concomitant increase in analgesic score,  

OR 

A reduction of at least 50% in analgesic use from baseline mean AS (only in patients with 
baseline mean AS ≥0) with no concomitant increase in pain.  

Either criterion must be maintained for two consecutive evaluations at least 3 weeks apart.   The 
duration of pain response will be measured from the first to the last assessment at which the above 
pain response criteria are satisfied. 

Pain progression (applies to all patients) will be defined as an increase of ≥1 point in the median 
PPI from its nadir noted on two consecutive three-week-apart visits  

OR  

≥25% increase in the mean analgesic score compared with the baseline score and noted on two 
consecutive three-week-apart visits  

OR  

requirement for local palliative radiotherapy. 

Pain progression as defined above must be cancer-related (ie, supported by clinical and/or 
radiological evidence of disease progression).  Patients should only be discontinued from study 
treatment for cancer-related pain progression. 

Median PPI and mean AS will be calculated only if 5 of the 7 expected values are actually 
available in the Patient Pain Diary. Otherwise, the patient will be considered as not evaluable for 
pain efficacy criteria at the corresponding cycle:

SAFETY 

Safety profile will be determined by the incidence of clinically significant adverse events (AEs) 
including serious adverse events (SAEs) and laboratory abnormalities.  AEs will be collected 
from the time the first dose of the study drug until 30 days after the administration of the last 
cycle of study treatment.  SAE will be collected from the time patient sign the informed consent 
form until 30 days after the last cycle of the study treatment.  Toxicity will be graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 
(NCI CTCAE v. 3.0) and summarized using MedDRA terminology. 

Vital signs, physical examination, ECOG performance status and ECG and LVEF and laboratory 
tests will be performed prior to drug administration and at specified regular intervals throughout 
the study.   

9.3 

PHARMACOKINETICS 

9.3.1  Sampling time 

The aim of the sampling strategy is to define the PK profile over the whole population by drawing 
a small number of samples in a sufficient number of patients [22], as opposed to standard PK 
protocols where a small number of patients are extensively sampled. 

Blood sample collection will be performed according to a sparse sampling strategy in as many 
patients as possible in Arm B (XRP6258 arm) at Cycle 1 and in 25 patients in Cycle2. 

The selection of sampling time was based on both known pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
XRP6258 and methodological consideration (need to vary sampling times) across patients for 
insuring the robustness of the analysis [23] 

Four sampling schedules with each 6 samples of 4 mL each have been designed according to a 
full PK screening in Phase I as described in Table 3 

Sampling schedules will be randomly assigned to patients via the IVRS in order to have balanced 
numbers of patients in each sampling schedule.

and its metabolite (RPR123142) when patients are sampled at Cycle 1 and 48 mL, if blood 
collection occurs at Cycles 1 and 2. 

9.3.2  PK handling procedure  

Venous whole blood samples will be collected into heparinized coated tubes (lithium heparinate) 
for XRP6258.  

Blood samples should not be taken at the infusion site.  

After centrifugation, plasma samples will be stored frozen at approximately -20°C until analysis. 

Central collection facilities will be used to collect the plasma samples from various sites and then 
will be shipped in batches to sanofi-aventis GMPK Department, Alfortville, France. 

Specific instructions for specimen collection, processing, and shipping are described in Appendix 
C. 

9.3.3  Bioanalytical method 

The plasma concentrations of XRP6258 and its metabolite, RPR123142, will be determined by a 
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry technique (LC/MS-MS) in Bioanalytical Department, 
GMPK, sanofi-aventis, Alfortville, France.  The limit of quantitation for both compounds is 
1ng/mL using 200 µL of plasma.

10  PATIENT SAFETY 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

10.1  SAFETY ENDPOINTS ASSESSED IN THIS TRIAL 

Serious Adverse Events will be collected from the time patient signs an informed consent form 
until 30 days after the administration of the last cycle of study treatment.    Adverse events will be 
collected from the time of the first dose of the investigational product.  Toxicity will be graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
Version 3.0 (NCI CTCAE v. 3.0) and summarized using MedDRA terminology.  Safety 
evaluations will include vitals signs, physical examination, ECOG performance status, ECG, 
LVEF, and laboratory tests.  These evaluations will be performed prior to drug administration, at 
specified regular intervals, and as required throughout the study. 

10.2  ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORING 

All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and 
included in the final clinical study report (CSR). 

10.3  DEFINITIONS OF ADVERSE EVENT (AE) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) 

An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 

A priori, efficacy endpoints will not be considered as AEs except if, because of the course or 
severity or any other features of such events, the Investigator, according to his/her best medical 
judgment, considers these events as exceptional in this medical condition. 

A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•  Results in death or; 
• 
Is life-threatening or; 

Note: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
•  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or; 
•  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or; 
•  Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• 

Is a medically important event:

XRP6258/EFC6193 
 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient 
or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 

These should also usually be considered serious. 

Note: Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or asymptomatic ALT increase ≥10 
ULN that does not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 

10.4  OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 

Adverse Events 

For this study, Serious Adverse Events, regardless of relationship to study medication, will be 
collected from the time a patient signs an informed consent form until 30 days after the 
administration of the last cycle of study treatment.    SAEs occurring more than 30 days after the 
last dose of study medication that are considered to be related to study medication will also be 
collected.  Adverse events, regardless of relationship to study medication, will be collected from 
the time of the first dose of study medication until 30 days after the administration of the last 
cycle of study treatment.  At the end of study treatment, all AEs and SAEs considered related to 
study medication must be followed to resolution and recorded on the CRF, as applicable.   

Whenever possible, symptoms should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis. The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to Investigational 
Product, corrective treatment/therapy given, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the Adverse Event was caused by the Investigational Product.  

Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as Adverse Events only if they 
are associated with the following clinical consequences: fulfilling a seriousness criterion, leading 
to treatment discontinuation, and/or leading to a dose modification. 

Serious Adverse Events 

In the case of a Serious Adverse Event the Investigator must immediately: 
•  SEND (within 1 working day, preferably by fax) the signed and dated corresponding page(s) 
in the Case Report Form to the representative of the Monitoring Team whose name, address, 
and fax number appear on the Clinical Trial Protocol; 

•  ATTACH the photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these 

examinations were performed. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is 
protected and the patient's identifiers in the Clinical Trial are properly mentioned on any copy 
of source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory 
normal ranges;

•  Follow-up of any Serious Adverse Event that is fatal or life threatening should be provided 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

within one additional calendar week.  

• 

Follow-up 
•  The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, 
notably he should follow up the outcome of any Adverse Events (clinical signs, laboratory 
values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or consolidation of the patient's condition; 
In the case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient must be followed up until clinical 
recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has 
been stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the patient has left the 
Clinical Trial and that additional investigations may be requested by the Monitoring Team; 
In the case of any Serious Adverse Event brought to the attention of the Investigator at any 
time after cessation of Investigational Product and considered by him/her to be caused by the 
Investigational Product with a reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the Monitoring 
Team. 

• 

10.5  OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR  

During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IP, to the Investigators, to the Authorities, 
and to the IECs / IRBs as appropriate.  Any other SAE not listed as an expected event in the 
Investigator’s Brochure will be considered as unexpected.  The Sponsor will report all safety 
observations made during the conduct of the trial in the CSR.

•  Disease progression (or death due to progressive disease): the date and evidence for disease 

progression will be documented in the medical record.  Note that patients should only be 
removed from treatment for pain progression if pain is cancer-related and supported by 
clinical evidence and/or radiological of disease progression. 

•  Adverse event (including death), treatment-limiting toxicity, intercurrent medical problem, 

that contra-indicate continuation of anticancer chemotherapy 

•  Voluntary withdrawal 
•  Patient lost to follow-up 
•  Other reason (eg, protocol violation, investigator’s decision) 

Withdrawal from trial 

Patients will be withdrawn from the trial for the following medical and/or administrative reasons: 
•  Completed follow-up period (2 years) 
•  Death 
•  Poor compliance to protocol 
•  Voluntary withdrawal 
•  Patient lost to follow-up 
•  Other reason 

When a patient withdraws from the trial, the reason of withdrawal will be documented in the 
medical chart and recorded on the CRF. An attempt to obtain all end of study evaluations is 
expected. All data collected for the entire course of the study must be recorded on CRFs and 
provided to the Sponsor. 

Reasons for withdrawal 

The patients may withdraw from the trial or from treatment at any time if they decide to do so, 
regardless of the reason.  Patients may also be removed from the trial or from treatment at the 
discretion of the investigator.

13  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

The material of section 13 of the Clinical Trial Protocol is the basis for the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) for the study. This plan may be revised during the study to accommodate Clinical 
Trial Protocol amendments and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution 
and data that affect planned analyses. 

13.1  SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION 

The primary endpoint for the study is overall survival (OS). The median survival for patients 
receiving mitoxantrone plus prednisone is estimated to be 8.0 months (11). A 25% improvement 
in median overall survival from 8.0 months to 10.67 months, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 
0.75 in patients treated with XRP6258 plus prednisone, is considered to be clinically meaningful. 

Assuming that survival times are exponentially distributed in both treatment arms, a total number 
of 511 deaths are required to provide 90% power to detect a 25% reduction in hazard rate using a 
two-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 0.05.  

Based on an anticipated uniform accrual rate over a period of 24 months, a total of 720 patients 
(360 patients per treatment arm) would need to be enrolled in order to achieve the required 
number of deaths by the end of the minimum follow-up period. 

13.2  ANALYSIS VARIABLES 

13.2.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics 

Standard demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, race, height and weight), 
medical history, cancer diagnosis and prior anti-cancer therapy will be collected at baseline. 
Baseline efficacy variables, eg, tumor assessment, pain, PSA, and other prognostic variables will 
be assessed as well, baseline value being defined as the last value or measurement taken up to the 
first dose in the study. 

13.2.2 Efficacy variables 

13.2.2.1 Primary efficacy variable 

The primary efficacy variable is overall survival defined as the time interval from the date of 
randomization to the date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, 
survival time will be censored at the last date patient is known to be alive or at the cut-off date, 
whichever comes first.

13.2.2.2 Secondary efficacy variables 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Main secondary efficacy variables are defined as follows: 
•  PSA Response (Applies only to patients with baseline PSA ≥20 ng/mL): Response requires 

a PSA decline of ≥50% confirmed by a second PSA value at least three weeks later. The 
duration of PSA response will be measured from the first to the last assessment at which the 
above criteria are satisfied. 

•  PSA Progression (Applies to all patients):  

 
In PSA non-responders, progression will be defined as a ≥25% increase over the nadir 
(provided that the increase in the absolute value PSA level is at least 5 ng/ml), confirmed by a 
second value at least 1 week later. 
 
In PSA responders and in patients not evaluable for PSA response at baseline, progression 
will be defined as a ≥50% increase over the nadir (provided that the increase in the absolute 
value PSA level is at least 5 ng/ml), confirmed by a second value at least 1 week later. 
 
The detailed censoring rules will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
 
Progression Free Survival: PFS will be evaluated from the date of randomization to the date 
of tumor progression, PSA progression, pain progression (pain progression supported by 
clinical evidence and/or radiological of disease progression), or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first.  The detailed censoring rules will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 

•  Overall Response Rate (in patients with measurable disease): 

 
Objective responses (CR and PR) for measurable disease as assessed by investigators 
according to RECIST criteria.  Confirmation of objective responses will be performed by 
repeat tumor imaging (CT scans, MRI, bone scans) at least 4 weeks after the first 
documentation of response 

•  Pain Response (applies only to patients with median PPI ≥2 on McGill-Melzack scale and/or 
mean Analgesic Score ≥10 points at baseline):  Pain Response will be defined as a 2-point or 
greater reduction from baseline median PPI with no concomitant increase in analgesic score, 
OR a reduction of at least 50% in analgesic use from baseline mean AS (only in patients with 
baseline mean AS ≥10) with no concomitant increase in pain. Either criterion must be 
maintained for two consecutive evaluations at least 3 weeks apart. 

•  Pain Progression (applies to all patients): Pain Progression will be defined as an increase of 

≥1 point in the median PPI from its nadir noted on two consecutive three-week-apart visits OR 
≥25% increase in the mean analgesic score compared with the baseline score and noted on two 
consecutive three-week-apart visits OR requirement for local palliative radiotherapy. The 
detailed censoring rules will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

Note that pain progression as defined above must be cancer-related (ie, supported by clinical 
and/or radiological evidence of disease progression). 

13.2.3 Safety variables 

Analysis of safety will be performed by summarizing Adverse Events, vital signs (blood pressure, 
heart rate, and temperature), ECG (only baseline and end of treatment), ECOG performance 
status, LVEF, and laboratory data. 

13.2.4 Pharmacokinetic variables 

The population PK analysis will be carried out using nonlinear mixed effect modeling and will be 
focused on the estimation of total plasma clearance (CL) and exposure (AUC) for XRP6258 and 
on exposure (AUC) and metabolic ratio (AUC metabolites/AUC parent compound) for 
RPR123142. 

13.3  ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 

13.3.1 Efficacy populations 

13.3.1.1 Intent-to-treat (ITT) population 

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized patients (ie, patients assigned to a 
treatment group by the randomization, regardless of whether patients received any study drug or 
received a different study drug from which they were randomized. Analysis of the primary 
efficacy endpoint will be performed using the ITT population. Secondary and exploratory efficacy 
endpoints will also be analyzed in the ITT population, and in evaluable patients whenever 
applicable (see Section 13.4). 

13.3.1.2 Clinical Trial Protocol deviations 

During a blinded review of the database, compliance with the protocol will be examined with 
regard to inclusion/exclusion criteria, prohibited therapies, and timing and availability of planned 
assessments. Protocol deviations will be identified by the clinical trial team before database lock 
and will be classified as minor or major deviations. 

The detailed definition of all major deviations will be provided in the SAP. All major protocol 
deviations will be summarized to assess the quality of the study conduct. 

13.3.2 Safety population 

The safety population will include all patients who received at least part of one dose of study 
drug. Treatment compliance/administration and all clinical safety data will be summarized using 
this safety population.

Not applicable  

13.3.4 Disposition of patients 

The number and percentage of patients in each of the above-defined populations will be provided.  

In addition, reasons for treatment discontinuation as well as reasons for withdrawal from the study 
will be displayed for randomized patients by treatment group. 

13.4  STATISTICAL METHODS 

Categorical data will be summarized in contingency tables presenting frequencies and appropriate 
percentages for each treatment group. Continuous data will be summarized using frequency, 
mean, standard deviation, median (if appropriate), minimum and maximum by treatment group. 
Descriptive analyses will be summarized by treatment group and overall only for the description 
of baseline characteristics.  

The chi-square test will be used to compare proportions (replaced by Fisher’s exact test if the 
expected frequency in any one of the cells of the contingency table is <5). 

The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to analyze time-to-event data and to estimate the median 
time. Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented as well. The 95% confidence interval for the median 
time will be calculated using the Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) method.  

Time-to-event distributions will be compared using the log rank test, stratified on the two 
stratification factors used in the randomization (namely measurability of disease and ECOG 
performance status).  

Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals will be estimated from Cox proportional hazards 
models stratified by the same stratification factors described above. 

13.4.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics 

13.4.1.1 Patients demographic characteristics, medical history and diagnoses 

All patient demographic characteristics, medical history, and diagnoses will be tabulated based on 
the ITT population. Continuous variables (such as age, weight, and height) will be summarized as 
described above. Qualitative characteristics (such as race) will be summarized by counts and 
percentages (n;%). 

13.4.1.2 Previous medications 

Previous anti-cancer therapies (prior hormone therapy, prior surgery, prior radiotherapy, etc.) will 
be summarized by frequencies.

13.4.2 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Extent of exposure will be assessed within the safety population. 

Number of patients treated, number of cycles administered, duration of dosing (weeks), 
cumulative dose (mg/m²), dose intensity (mg/m²/week) and relative dose intensity (%) will be 
summarized by treatment group. 

Dose delays and dose reductions will be also analyzed. 

Further details of the statistical evaluation of the extent of exposure will be provided in the SAP. 

13.4.3 Analysis of efficacy variables 

13.4.3.1 Analysis of primary efficacy variable 

OS will be compared between the two treatments by the log-rank test procedure at the 0.0076 
significance level at the second interim analysis and 0.0476 significance level at the final analysis, 
stratified in the ITT population in the second interim analysis and the final analysis by 
stratification factors as specified at the time of randomization: measurability of disease per 
RECIST criteria (measurable vs. non-measurable disease) and ECOG PS (0-1 vs. 2) . 

. 

The estimates of the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be provided 
using a Cox proportional hazard model stratified by the same stratification factors as those used 
for the log-rank test described above. 

The survival curves will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.  

Additional exploratory analysis may be considered and will be detailed in the SAP. For example, 
the Cox proportional hazard model may be used to examine the effect of various prognostic 
factors on OS. 

13.4.3.2 Analysis of secondary efficacy variables 

All analyses for secondary efficacy variables will be carried out in the ITT population. 

Progression Free Survival, PSA progression, and Pain progression will be compared between the 
two treatments by the log-rank test procedure. Medians and 95% confidence intervals will also be 
provided by treatment arm. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be provided using a 
Cox proportional hazard model. 

Tumor, PSA, and pain response will be compared between groups using chi-square tests.  

As a supportive analysis, PSA response will be also evaluated in the subset of patients with 
baseline PSA ≥20 ng/mL.

13.4.4 Analysis of safety data 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

Analysis of Adverse Events, vital signs, ECG, LVEF, and laboratory data will be descriptive and 
conducted on the exposed population as defined in Section 13.3.2, Safety population. Summary of 
safety data will also be performed by cycle (when applicable).  For each of the safety parameters, 
a baseline value will be defined as the last value or measurement taken up to the first dose in the 
study. 

13.4.4.1 Adverse Events 

Serious Adverse Events will be collected from the time patient signs an informed consent form 
until 30 days after the administration of the last cycle of study treatment.    Adverse events will be 
collected from the time of the first dose of the investigational product.  Adverse events will be 
summarized with the number and percentage of patients with adverse events, classified by 
MedDRA preferred term and intensity as graded by the NCI CTCAE, v. 3.0.  

Adverse events will be considered as treatment-emergent if they first occur or worsen after the 
first day of dosing and up to 30 days after the end of treatment. Tables of treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAE) will be provided.  

SAEs and Treatment–Emergent SAEs will be summarized using MedDRA classification to the 
preferred term. SAEs will be also presented by worst NCI grade by patient. 

Adverse events will be analyzed regardless of their relationship to the study drug. However, 
summaries will be done for specific subsets of adverse events, such as events related to study 
drug. 

13.4.4.2 Laboratory safety data 

Hematological toxicities will be assessed from laboratory parameters. Worst NCI CTCAE grades 
of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia will be calculated according to the 
NCI common terminology criteria. 

Qualitative and quantitative results will be summarized for hematological toxicities. Qualitative 
data (worst NCI CTCAE grade) will be summarized by cycle and by patient.  

Biochemistry will be analyzed using the worst NCI CTCAE grade, whenever applicable 
(laboratory normal ranges, otherwise) calculated from laboratory values.

13.4.5 Analyses of pharmacokinetic variables 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

13.4.5.1 Sample size determination for Pharmacokinetics  

Effect of prednisone   

Based on XRP6258 mean plasma clearance of 27.3 (±9.7) L/h/m² in 23 patients with various type 
of tumors from Phase I study V-103 (1 hour infusion every 3 weeks), a minimum total number of 
21 patients is required to detect a 20% difference in mean clearance with 80% power using a one 
sample t-test at significance level 0.05 (each patient being its own reference). 

13.4.5.2 Population PK model  

Pharmacokinetic analysis of XRP6258 will be carried out using nonlinear mixed effect modeling 
(NONMEM software version V or more recent). 

The analysis will involve an estimation of inter-patient PK variability, the population 
pharmacokinetic parameters estimates and the assessments of patho-physiologic covariate effects 
on CL and possibly on volume if warranted. Empirical Bayesian estimation of individual 
parameters and of individual exposure (AUC: Area Under the Curve) will also be performed. 

PK estimates will then be investigated as prognostic factors for clinical outcome including safety 
and efficacy endpoints if possible. 

13.4.5.3  Statistical on PK parameters  

An in vitro study (SA 00-221) has been conducted to evaluate the potential of dexamethasone, 
hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone and prednisone to induce/inhibit cytochrome 
P450 isoenzymes in human primary human hepatocytes [24]. Prednisone was found to be a 
significant inducer of CYP3A4/5 and a slight inducer of CYP2A6.  These results were similar to 
those found in the study by Pichard et al. [25] 

Because XRP6258 is metabolized by CYP3A4/5, the effect of prednisone will be investigated by 
comparing the XRP6258 clearance at Cycle 1, on Day 1 (no effect of prednisone expected, since 
it corresponds to the first day of administration of prednisone) and at Cycle 2, on Day 1 (10 mg 
daily administration for 3 weeks) in Arm B. 

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software (SAS version 8.2 or more recent; SAS 
Institute INC, NC). 

Comparison of XRP6258 CL and possibly of RPR123142 dose normalized AUC will be 
conducted using the PROC MIXED procedure after log transformation of the PK parameter. In 
the statistical model implemented, inter-individual variability will be considered as a random 
effect and treatment effect (Cycle 2 vs. Cycle 1) will be considered as fixed effects.

13.5  DATA HANDLING CONVENTIONS 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

In general there will be no imputation of missing data. 

Some patients may be excluded from secondary or exploratory analyses as a result of missing 
data. Specifically, patients who are non evaluable for secondary/exploratory analysis will be 
excluded from the analyses on PSA response, tumor response, and pain response. 

Specific rules will be applied to evaluate some efficacy variables, for example: 
•  PSA response will be assessed only among patients with a baseline PSA ≥20 ng/ml. 
•  Tumor response will be calculated among patients with measurable disease. 
•  Pain response is to be applied only to patients with baseline present pain intensity score (PPI) 

≥2 on the McGill-Melzack scale and/or baseline mean analgesic score (AS) ≥10 points. 

13.6 

INTERIM ANALYSIS 

An interim (futility) analysis of PFS (either tumor progression, PSA progression, or pain 
progression, as defined above, or death from any cause) will be performed after 225 PFS events 
have occurred, ie, 33% information fraction at an estimated cut-off of 12 months after 1st patient 
has been randomized. Approximately 360 patients will have been accrued when this futility 
analysis is performed. 

This interim analysis (IA) will be used to estimate the probability that the null hypothesis of no 
treatment differences will be rejected upon completion of the trial. Early termination for futility 
will be considered if the conditional power of observing a significant effect at the end of the 
study, assuming the current trend continues, is less than 10%. 

The futility analysis on PFS is not an interim analysis of the primary endpoint (OS). Therefore, no 
adjustment will be done on the final p-value for the OS analysis (once at least 511 deaths are 
observed). 

The second interim analysis will be performed at the time of the 307 deaths (the 60% of the 511 
deaths in the final analysis of the protocol) to assess the primary efficacy endpoint of overall 
survival based on the O’Brien-Fleming type I error spending function. The statistical significance 
level at the interim analysis will be 0.0076 for the 2-sided stratified log rank test. In case the 
stopping criteria are not met at the time of this second interim analysis the study will continue and 
the final overall survival analysis will be performed with the 2-sided stratified log rank test at the 
0.0476 significance level.

results of the study, without the prior written consent of the Sponsor. 

The Investigator shall send to the Sponsor a copy of the manuscript for review and possible 
comments at least forty-five (45) days in advance of the date of submission to the journal and at 
least twenty (20) days in advance for abstracts. The publication shall be delayed until approval of 
publication is given in writing by the Sponsor, not to exceed ninety (90) days, it being understood 
that the Sponsor cannot refuse its consent without reasonable cause. The Investigator agrees to 
include the modifications requested by the Sponsor, provided they do not jeopardize the accuracy 
and/or the scientific value of the publication.  

Should the Sponsor desire to protect by a property right any information contained in the 
publication, it has the right to postpone the publication, for a period not to exceed eighteen (18) 
months. 

In multicenter studies, the Investigator agrees not to publish the results of the study pertaining to 
his/her center prior to the publication of the overall study results. If no publication has occurred 
within twelve (12) months of the termination of the study at all other sites, the Investigator shall 
have the right to publish independently the results of this study, patient to the review procedure 
set forth herein. If the study is conducted with the support of a Steering Committee, the latter may 
define specific rules for publication. 

The Investigator shall not use the name(s) of the Sponsor and/or its employees in advertising or 
promotional material or publication without the prior written consent of the Sponsor. The Sponsor 
shall not use the name(s) of the Investigator and/or the collaborators in advertising or promotional 
material or publication without having received his/her and/or their prior written consent(s).

Since study treatment is administered intravenously, blood samples for pharmacokinetic 
analysis should not be collected where study treatment is infused (eg, from a central line 
used for study treatment administration).  

For samples collected through a catheter, 1 mL of blood should be withdrawn and discarded to 
ensure that the solution used to maintain catheter potency not dilute the blood sample.

It is extremely important to collect all blood samples as close to the protocol-specified times as 
possible. The reasons for any missed or lost blood samples should be documented. Actual 
dates/times of blood collection should appear on the blood collection form in CRF at the study 
site. The times of drug administration (XRP6258) should also be precisely recorded. 

21-Jul-2008 
Version number: 1 (electronic 2.0) 

At the protocol-specified intervals indicated in Section 9.3.1, one Lithium heparinate vacutainer 
tube will be used to collect 4 mL of whole blood from patient for plasma preparation for the 
determination of circulating XRP6258 for pharmacokinetic analysis. 

It is important to carefully follow the steps outlined below: 
•  Collect 4 mL blood using a vacutainer tube containing lithium heparinate, and gently invert 

tube at least 8 times permitting specimen to mix with tubes anticoagulant 

•  The exact time of sample collection should be recorded on CRF. 
•  Within 30 min of collection, centrifuge at 2000 g for 15 min 
• 

Immediately following the centrifugation, transfer the top layer of human plasma into a pre- 
labeled polypropylene tube, being careful not to transfer blood cells. 

•  Ensure that all sample tubes are clearly and appropriately labeled. 
• 

Immediately cap tubes and freeze the plasma in an upright position at –20°C for storage. 

No more than 1 hour is allowed between blood collection and plasma sample frozen to avoid 
degradation of XRP6258. 

Storage  

Sample should be grouped according to patient in bubble wrap and placed in plastic freezer bag. 
All specimens must be stored frozen at -20°C in a freezer that is not frost-free until shipped to the 
sponsor. 

Labeling of specimens 

Each sample must be labeled with the following minimum information: 
 

Product code: 
Protocol number: 
Patient number: 

Sample number: 
Day and time interval of 
sample:

•  Samples must be packaged according to IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations, Packing 

Instructions 650. 

•  Absorbent material must be placed in the Ziploc storage bag containing samples packaged in 

bubble wrap (see above). 

•  All bagged samples are to be packed in dry ice in Styrofoam shippers with enough dry ice to 
ensure that the samples remain frozen for a 48-hour period for intra-continent shipments and 
for a 72-hour period cross-continent shipments. The following table indicates the 
recommended amount of dry ice that should be used.

•  Place dry ice along the bottom of the Styrofoam shipper.  
•  Place bagged samples on dry ice, add additional dry ice around the sides and top, and add lid. 
•  The Styrofoam shipper should be placed in the cardboard box in which the shipper arrived. 
•  The fully completed and signed “Sample Labels/Shipping Document” or “Sample Tracking 
Log and Shipping Form” corresponding to the samples shipped must be enclosed in a plastic 
resealable bag, then placed on top of the Styrofoam shipper between the lid and cardboard 
box. 

•  Seal cardboard box and place the “Dry Ice Label” and “UN3373” labels on the exterior of the 

cardboard box. 

•  The exterior of the box should be marked “RUSH – DIAGNOSTIC SPECIMENS PACKED 

IN COMPLIANCE WITH IATA PACKING INSTRUCTIONS – STORED AT -20°C”. 

Shipment preparation 
•  The sender must notify the shipment receiver prior to shipment, with date of shipment and any 

tracking information. 

•  Ship samples to Quest only Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday for intra-continent 

shipments, only Monday or Tuesday for cross-continent shipments, and not on the eve of 
a public holiday.

Appendix I 

Effective method of contraception for United Kingdom 

For patients enrolled in the UK, who are sexually active either during the study and/or for six 
months afterwards, must agree to use a condom during intercourse without fail, regardless of 
whether or not their partner is of childbearing potential. 

In addition to the man using a condom, partners of childbearing potential must use an effective 
means of contraception as described below: 
•  A condom in combination with a secondary barrier ( eg, intrauterine device or diaphragm) 
•  A barrier method in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly 
•  An intrauterine device in combination with a secondary barrier (eg, diaphragm) 

For those patients who have partners who are post-menopausal for 6 months or more, or are 
surgically sterile for more than one month, their partners are not required to use the 
contraceptives.  The patient must however still agree to use a condom.  Partners who are 
postmenopausal for less than two years and are not surgically sterile must have a negative 
pregnancy test. 

In case patient wants to have sexual intercourses with a pregnant or actively breast-feeding 
woman, he must also take precautions even if the risk of transmission of his treatment to this 
woman is low.  Patient and his female partner should agree to use medically appropriate 
contraceptive measures as previously described.
