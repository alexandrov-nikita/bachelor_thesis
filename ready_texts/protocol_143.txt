Planned duration of the study : 71  months (05/1998 - 03/2004) 

Clinical 
Phase:ll/111 

Planned enrollment duration  : 59  months (05/1998 - 03/2003) 

Phase II: 
Primary:  to  select  one  of the  2 test arms  (docetaxel  with  cisplatin,  docetaxel  with  cisplatin 
and  5-FU),  based  primarily  on  complete  responses,  to  advance  to  a  phase  Ill  survival 
comparison against the CDDP + 5-FU  control arm. 
Secondary: to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative safety profile of the 2 test groups. 

Phase Ill: 
Primary: to detect a statistically significant increase in  time to  progression  (TTP) for the test 
arm (TXT +CDDP+5-FU) relative to the control  arm (CDDP+5-FU). 
Main secondary : to detect a statistically significant increase in  overall  survival  (OS) for the 
test arm (TXT +CDDP+5-FU) relative to the control  arm (CDDP+5-FU). 
Other  secondary  :  to  compare  response  rates,  time  to  treatment  failure,  duration  of 
response,  safety profiles, quality of life and disease-related symptoms. 
Socio-economic data will  be  collected  in  order to  be  able  to  perform an  analysis  by  country 
when necessary. 
This is a prospective, multicentre, multinational, non  blinded, randomized phase 11/111  study. 
After having checked all eligibility criteria,  patients are randomly assigned in the phase II  part 
to  receive  either  docetaxel  +  CDDP  (arm  A)  or  docetaxel  +  5-FU  +  CDDP  (arm  B)  in  the 
phase  II  part.  During  the  phase  Ill  part,  patients  are  randomly  assigned  to  receive  TXT  + 
CDDP  +  5-FU  (test  arm)  or  CDDP  +  5-FU  (comparator  arm).  The  randomisation  will  be 
centralised  in  RPR  R&D  by  fax.  There  will  be  a stratification  by  liver involvement (yes/no), 
gastrectomy (yes/no),  measurable or evaluable only disease, weight loss  (~ 5% I> 5%) and

Diagnosis and  Main 
Criteria for Inclusion 

After  inclusion  of  30  patients,  evaluable  for  response,  in  each  arm  in  the  phase  II  part, 
complete  response  rate  will  be  determined  by  an  external  review  response  committee

Statistical 
methodology 

Efficacy : Efficacy will  be  assessed  by determination  of time to  progression and  survival  in 
each  arm  of  the  phase  Ill  part.  Patients  will  be  assessed  for  tumor  response  every  8 
weeks  and  will  be  considered  as  evaluable for tumor response  after having  received  at 
least 2 cycles of treatment, with at least a complete follow up tumor assessment with the 
same  imaging  procedures  as  baseline for each  lesion,  unless  early progression  occurs 
in  which  case  they  will  be  considered  evaluable  (in  progressive  disease).  Patients  on 
therapy  for  at  least  this  period  will  have  their  response  classified  according  to  the 
definitions  set  out below. Time  to  progression  and  overall  survival  will  be  evaluated  in  the 
full  analysis  population.  The  analysis  on  response  rate,  will  also  be  performed  in  the  per 
protocol population. Duration of response will also be calculated for responders. 
Safety: Safety profile of the treatment arms will  be evaluated. 
Clinical  and  laboratory  toxicities/symptomatology  will  be  graded  according  to  NCIC-CTG 

criteria.

most efficacious test arm. The arm with  highest CR rate,  however, will  not in 
itself determine the  optimal  test arm  but rather provide one  input into an  overall  benefit-risk 
analysis of the efficacy and  safety of the test arms.  The  relevance  of efficacy in  this  benefit(cid:173)
risk  analysis will  be  proportional  to  the  observed  difference in  CR  rates  after assessing  the 
influence  of any  imbalances  between  the  test arms  with  respect  to  prognostic factors  (liver 
and/or  peritoneal  metastases  and  prior  gastrectomy).  The  safety  of the  treatments  will  be 
assessed  by  analyzing  the  frequency  and  type  of serious  adverse  events  and  the  overall 
management of adverse events,  e.g.,  dose reductions/delays and supportive measures.

RADIOLOGICAL GUIDELINES : 

To  ensure  comparability,  the  baseline  X  ray/scans  and  subsequent  X  ray/scans  used  to  assess 
response  must  be  performed  using  identical  techniques  :  preferably  same  CT  machine,  same  slice 
thickness, window settings for all  examinations. When contrast injection is necessary,  it should be done 
with  similar  contrast  agent,  rate  and  volume.  Bolus  injection  is  mandatory  and  acquisition  should  be 
made at the adequate timing for optimized enhancement of the vessels.  If a lesion  is measured on  plain 
films  or  enhanced  images,  the  same  images  should  be  available for  all  examinations.  In  most  cases, 
plain and  enhanced CT are both  necessary. 
When  available,  helical  CT  acquisition  should  be  done.  Slice  thickness  should  be  adapted  to  the 
anatomical  area  and  presumed  size  of the  lesions.  Slice  thickness  of 5 to  8  mm  should  be  favoured 
rather than  10  mm,  especially during helical  acquisition.  If limitations appear in  volume acquisition,  it is 
encouraged to choose a 1.5 pitch and  thin  slices, rather than a 1 pitch with thick slices. 

A centimeter scale should appear on  films. 

DEFINITIONS : 

End of treatment 

The end  of treatment is 30 days after the last drug administered. 

End of study 

The end  of study is the time when the patient dies. 

Follow-up 

After the  end  of the  treatment,  survival,  further anti-cancer treatment  if any and  hospitalisations  (until  a 
second  line  treatment  is  given)  have  to  be  traced  every  three  months,  as  well  as  any  ongoing  study 
treatment-related adverse events until resolution. Tumor assessment and  quality of life administration will 
be  performed  every 8 weeks,  calculated  from  the  first treatment administration,  until  the  documentation 
of the progression for the  patients who did  not progress at end  of treatment.  Thereafter, quality of life will 
be administered every three months until death.

INTRODUCTION 

1.1. 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON  DOCETAXEL 

Please refer to the Investigator's Brochure (1) for full  information on docetaxel. 

1.1 .1 .  Background  Information on  docetaxel as a single agent 

Please refer to the Investigator's Brochure (1) for full  information on  docetaxel. 

Docetaxel  is  a  second-generation  taxoid  compound,  which  is  obtained  by  hemisynthesis,  using  a 
precursor extracted from  the needles of the european yew,  Taxus baccata.  Docetaxel is twice as potent 
as  paclitaxel  in  promoting  polymerisation  of  tubulin,  although  whether  this  result  in  superior  clinical 
antitumour  activity  has  not  been  demonstrated  so  far.  In  addition,  like  paclitaxel,  docetaxel  has  a 
radiation-sensiting effect. 

a)  Efficacy in breast cancer 

Single-agent therapy  : in  phase  II  trials,  first-line  therapy with  docetaxel  100  mg/m 2
,  given  as  a single 
agent  every  three  weeks,  led  to  a  high  overall  response  rate  of  56  %  in  metastatic  breast  cancer. 
Docetaxel as  second-line therapy in  advanced breast cancer led  to an  overall response rate of 40 %. At 
doses  lower  than  100  mg/m 2
,  the  antitumour  activity  appears  to  be  slightly  reduced,  but  only  a 
prospective,  randomised  clinical  trial  would  allow a valid  comparison  of different  doses  as  far as  their 
therapeutic index (i.e.  efficacy/toxicity ratio)  is  concerned. At doses of 60 mg/m 2  and  75 mg/m2  every 3-
4  weeks,  response  rates  for  second-line  therapy  with  docetaxel  were  33  %  and  46  %  in  advanced 
breast cancer.  A  dose of 50  mg/m2  on  days  1 and  8 every three weeks  has  shown  a response  rate  of 
34%. 

In  addition,  activity in  liver metastatic sites has been particularly encouraging.  Reported  results of phase 
II  trials  with  docetaxel  as  first-line  therapy which  demonstrated  an  overall  response  rate  for  liver  and 
lung metastases of 60% and 26 %, respectively. 

Phase  Ill  trials  investigating  docetaxel  as  a  single  agent,  and  the  sequencing  of  docetaxel  and 
anthracycline combinations  in  metastatic breast cancer are ongoing. Preliminary results of two phase Ill 
trials  of docetaxel  (1 00  mg/m 2
)  in  alkylating-agent  failures  on 
one  hand,  and  with  mitomycin  C  (12  mg/m 2
,  q3  weeks)  in 
anthracycline-failures  on  the  other  hand,  were  presented  at  the  1997  ASCO  meeting  and  look 
particularly encouraging  : a significantly higher  response  rate,  in  favour  of docetaxel,  was  observed  in 
both  trials,  which  involved  326  and  200  patients,  respectively.  A  longer  follow-up  is  needed  to  draw 
conclusions  about  survival,  progression-free  survival,  and  quality  of  life.  Docetaxel  is  also  being 
incorporated into adjuvant and high-dose chemotherapy programs. 

),  compared  with  doxorubicin  (75  mg/m 2

,  q6  weeks)  plus  vinblastine  (6  mg/m2

b)  Efficacy in  ovarian cancer 

In  four different studies,  docetaxel  100  mg/m2  showed  substantial  activity in  advanced  ovarian  cancer 
refractory to  cisplatin  or carboplatin  therapy.  Overall,  in  these  606  patients,  a total  response  rate  of 33 
%was observed.

chemotherapy for advanced disease.

c)  Efficacy in lung cancer 

In two phase II  trials,  docetaxel  1 00 mg/m 2  was administered as first-line therapy as a one-hour infusion 
every  three  weeks  in  patients  with  advanced  (predominantly  stage  IV)  NSCLC.  Objective  response 
rates  of  38  %  (n=29)  and  33  %  (n=39),  respectively,  were  observed.  The  corresponding  projected 
median  survival  times  were  6.3  months  and  47  weeks.  In  cisplatin-refractory  disease,  docetaxel  100 
mg/m 2  every  three  weeks  was  associated  with  an  objective  response  rate  of  21  %  and  a  median 
survival  of 45 weeks.  These  results  are  comparable with  those  achieved  with  the  most active first-line 
monotherapy agents, such as cisplatin and  ifosfamide. 

Docetaxel  has  also  displayed  activity  in  SCLC  as  reported  with  the  results  of  an  EORTC  study 
evaluating  SCLC  patients,  the  majority of whom  had  received  prior chemotherapy  : in  the  28  patients 
evaluated, there was a partial response rate of 25% and a median response duration of 4.7 months. 

d)  Efficacy in other cancers 

Docetaxel  has  demonstrated  activity  in  phase  II  studies  in  a  number  of  other  cancers.  Particularly 
encouraging  results  have  been  seen  in  head  and  neck  cancer,  with  a  response  rate  of 34  %.  This 
compares  favourably  with  the  rate  achieved  with  methotrexate  ( 18  % },  the  current  standard  therapy. 
Antitumor activity was  also  observed  in  gastric cancer (see  1 .1.2),  advanced  malignant melanoma and 
soft tissue  sarcomas.  In  the  latter disease,  docetaxel  has  been  compared  with  doxorubicin  as first-line 
therapy within  the framework of the  EORTC.  However,  the  study had  to  be  closed  prematurely in  view 
of insufficient activity of docetaxel as first-line therapy. 

e)  Combination therapy 

Docetaxel  has demonstrated enhanced activity when combined with  a number of other cytotoxic agents 
in  murine  studies.  Phase  1111  studies  have  demonstrated  high  response  rates  when  docetaxel  is 
combined with cisplatin in  NSCLC and  other solid tumours and with  doxorubicin in  breast cancer.  Unlike 
paclitaxel,  the  adverse  event  profile  of  docetaxel  in  combination  does  not  appear  to  be  sequence 
dependent. 

f)  Adverse events 

In  most  phase  II  studies,  docetaxel  has  been  administered  at  a  dose  of  100  mg/m2  as  a  one-hour 
infusion  every  three  weeks.  The  main  dose-limiting  side  effect  with  docetaxel  is  myelosuppression, 
resulting  in  profound  but  short-lasting  neutropenia.  In  a retrospective  analysis  of 1 ,300  patients,  those 
with  elevated  hepatic enzyme levels at baseline were  more  likely to  have febrile  neutropenia,  infection 
and  mucositis and  the rate  of death due to  adverse events was higher.  In  the case of liver dysfunction, 
the dose of docetaxel  should  be  reduced  and  a prospective study in  such  patients is presently ongoing 
in  the  USA.  Docetaxel  is  associated  with  HSRs  (Hypersensitivity  reactions).  These  comprise  mainly 
pruritus,  flushing,  rash,  drug-induced fever or chills,  usually occurring within  minutes of administration. 
Without  steroid  premedication,  they  can  be  seen  in  up  to  25  %  of  patients.  Mild-to-moderate  dose(cid:173)
dependent neuropathy has  also been  reported  with  docetaxel. This is  not dose limiting and  is  generally 
reversible. 

An  unusual  and  still  poorly understood  side  effect of docetaxel  is  fluid  retention,  which  is  characterized 
by peripheral edema, ascites or pleural effusion, sometimes associated with significant weight gain. The 
incidence  of  fluid  retention  increases  at  cumulative  doses  of  :<::400  mg/m 2  and  can  be  a  reason  for 
treatment  discontinuation.  In  a  randomized  clinical  trial,  pre- and  post-medication  with  steroids  was 
shown  to  delay  and  reduce  the  severity of fluid  retention;  steroids  are  now  routinely  given  before  and 
after treatment with  docetaxel.

Asthenia  is  a  common  complaint,  starting  a  few  days  after  docetaxel  administration.  It  is  severe  in  a 
minority of patients.  Cutaneous  reactions  are  frequently seen  with  short  infusion  schedules  (1-6  hours 
every  three  weeks)  and  include  thinning  and  ridging  of  nail  plates  and  erythema.  Mild-to-moderate 
arthralgias  have  been  reported  infrequently.  No  cardiac  toxicity  has  been  observed  with  docetaxel.  As 
with paclitaxel, alopecia is seen in  the overwhelming majority of patients.

1.1.2.  Background Information on docetaxel as a single agent in  gastric cancer 

• 

The  efficacy  of  docetaxel  single  agent  as  first-line  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced  gastric 
cancer has been  investigated  in  two  phase II  clinical  trials  in  Europe and  the  USA.  In  Japan, two  phase 
II  trials  in  previously  treated  patients  with  chemotherapy  (as  adjuvant  and/or  for  advanced  disease) 
were performed with docetaxel at 60 mg/m 2
In  the  European  study,  8  of  33  evaluable  patients  (24%)  (95%CI=  [9%-39%])  achieved  a  partial 
response  for  a  median  duration  of 7.5  months  (range,  3 ->11  months)  {2).  None  of the  patients  had 
previously  received  chemotherapy  and  all  had  histologically  proven  advanced  gastric  carcinoma. 
Responses to docetaxel were seen  in a variety of metastatic sites,  including the liver and retroperitoneal 
lymph  nodes,  and  occured  after  2  cycles  of  treatment  in  6  out  of  8  responders.  Patients  who  had 
undergone  surgery to  remove  the  primary tumour responded  more frequently than  did  those who  had 
not (7/19 (37%) vs 1/18 (5%);  p=0.06). 
In  the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial  in the  USA, 41  patients, who had not received 
prior chemotherapy, were entered. Two complete responses and  5 partial responses were achieved out 
of  the  36  evaluable  patients  yielding  a  19%  response  rate  (95%  Cl=  [6%;  32%])  (3).  The  complete 
responses were achieved  in  one  patient with  pleural-based  mass and  local  recurrence and  in  a second 
patient  with  both  abdominal  and  extraabdominal  lymph  nodes.  Median  time  to  progression  was  2.8 
months.  The  median  overall  survival  was  7.9  months  and  the  estimated  survival  at  18  months  was 
17%. 

In  a  Japanese  early  phase II  study  in  patients  previously  treated  with  chemotherapy,  3/15  patients 
(20%)  with  gastric  cancer  showed  a  partial  response  following  treatment  with  docetaxel  60 mg/m2 
infused  over a  1 hour period  every 3-4 weeks  (4).  None of these  patients  had  responded  to  previous 
chemotherapy. 

In  a late Japanese phase  II  study conducted  in  previously treated  patients,  docetaxel was administered 
to  57  patients at 60 mg/m 2  without premedication. The preliminary data available show a response rate 
of 22% with  1 CR and  9 PRs out of 45 evaluable patients.  Patients with  a locally recurrent disease had 
a higher response rate (28.6%) than patients with stage IV disease (16.7%) (5). 

The  results  of  the  single  agent  studies  with  docetaxel  are  consistent  across  Europe,  Japan  and  the 
USA.  The  response  rate  achieved  is  comparable  to  the  response  rates  reported  for  the  most  active 
agents  in  advanced  gastric  cancer  such  as  5-fluorouracil,  cisplatin,  methotrexate,  mitomycin  and 
doxorubicin.

1 .1.3.  Background Information on  Docetaxel in  Combination with CDDP in  Gastric Cancer 

Cisplatin  and  docetaxel  have  both  shown  interesting  activity  in  different solid  tumors  including  gastric 
adenocarcinoma  and  their toxicity profiles  only marginally overlap.  Obviously,  the combination  of both 
drugs could  be  of major relevance.  Interestingly,  a higher rate of cisplatin-DNA adduct formation when 
CDDP is given before docetaxel was suggested to  be potentially predictive of a higher activity when the 
combination  is  given  in  this  sequence  (6).  Based  on  the  interesting  single  agent activity of docetaxel, 
the  SAKK  (Swiss  Group  for  Clinical  Cancer  Research)  conducted  a  phase  1-11  trial  investigating  its 
activity and tolerance in  combination with cisplatin. With paclitaxel  (which shares the same mechanism 
of action  as  docetaxel),  more  myelotoxicity was  observed  when  cisplatin  preceeded  immediately the 
infusion  of paclitaxel  (7).  With  docetaxel,  no  evident  schema  dependant toxicity was  noted.  Although 
pharmacokinetic  studies  did  not show any significant difference  in  PK parameters  (clearance)  of both 
docetaxel  and  cisplatin  between  the  two  sequences  and  these  parameters  were  similar  to  those 
observed with docetaxel when  used as  single agent,  it has been  decided to give CDDP after docetaxel. 
In  a recently published  phase  I trial  of CDDP and  Taxotere®,  it was found  that the  myelotoxicity of the 
combination  is  33% higher when  CDDP  is  given before Taxotere®.  For this  reason,  Taxotere® has to 
be administered before CDDP(8). 

Patients  with  advanced  gastric  cancer  not  pretreated  palliatively  by  chemotherapy,  with  measurable 
disease,  PS  0-1,  normal  blood  count,  and  normal  hepatic  and  renal  functions  received  up  to  a 
maximum  of 8  cycles  of docetaxel  85mg/m 2  d1  and  cisplatin  75mg/m 2  d1  every 3 weeks.  Docetaxel 
escalation  to  1 00mg/m 2  in  5 patients was  too  toxic and  discontinued.  Among  48  patients  accrued,  47 
patients  (mean  age  55,  mean  weight  loss  over  the  last  3  months  4.5Kg,  M:F  75%  :  25%)  were 
evaluable  for  toxicity  and  45  for  response.  Two  CRs  and  22  PRs  (RR=53%,  95%CI:  38-68%)  were 
observed.  Three deaths occurred:  two  pulmonary embolisms and  one suicide.  Grade 3 toxicities were 
neutropenia  68%,  thrombocytopenia  6%,  alopecia  36%,  fatigue  9%,  mucositis  4%,  neurotoxicity 2%, 
nausea/vomiting 2%,  and  one  episode of hypersensitivity reaction  precluding treatment administration. 
Nine  episodes  of  non-fatal  febrile  neutropenia  were  observed  in  eight  patients,  two  of  them  with 
docetaxel  at  1 00mg/m 2
.  Other  toxicities  were  grade  1-2  neurotoxicity  44%,  fluid  retention  32%, 
anaphylactoid  reaction  6%,  and  nine  transitory  grade  1 renal  toxicity.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that the 
neurotoxicity of CDDP was not enhanced by the administration of docetaxel and  no dose reduction due 
to the neurotoxicity of the combination was made during the performance of the trial. 
Docetaxel  in  association  with  CDDP,  as  used,  is  well  tolerated  and  has  a  significant  efficacy  in 
advanced  gastric  cancer  and  may  serve  as  basis  for  further  developments  of  docetaxel  containing 
regimen  in  this disease.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON  COOP 

1.2.1.  Mechanism of action 

Cisplatin  is  the  first  heavy  metal  compound  to  achieve  a  significant  degree  of  usefulness  as  an 
anticancer  agent.  One  mode  of  cytotoxic  action  appears  to  be  inhibition  of DNA  precursors  although 
protein  and  RNA synthesis  to  a lesser extent are also  inhibited.  lntrastrand  crosslinking  of DNA due to 
platinum  also  occurs  and  is  the  major  mechanism  of  action.  Cisplatin  does  not  appear  to  possess 
significant cell-cycle dependancy and toxicity is therefore similar in  all  phases of the cell cycle (9). 

1.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Data 

Pharmacokinetic data about CDDP are summarised as follows:

t ~ !): 
t ~y: 
After high dose t ~ a: 

20-30 min 

approx 60 min 
approx 24 h 

30 min 

Cisplatin  is  inactivated  intracellularly  and  in  the  blood  stream  by  sulfhydril  groups.  The  drug  binds 
covalently  to  gluthathione,  metallothioneins,  and  sulfhydrils  on  proteins.  Cisplatin  concentrates  in  liver 
and  kidneys.  Approximately 25% of an  administered dose is  excreted from  the body during the first 24 
hours. Of that portion eliminated, excretion is  renal(> 90%) and bile{< 10 %) (10). 

1.2.3. 

In vitro studies of CDDP metabolizing enzymes I Drug interactions 

Cisplatin  interacts  with  other  compounds  in  several  ways:  (I)  incompatibilities  with  certain  type  of 
parenteral  administration  materials,  (II)  modulation  by  non  cytotoxic  compounds  that  alter  the 
therapeutic  index of the  drug when  administered to  intact hosts and  (Ill) synergism with  other cytotoxic 
drugs. 

(I) 

(II) 

Cisplatin  reacts  with  aluminium  surfaces  as  found  in 
intravenous  needles  to  form  metal 
precipitates,  effectively  lowering  the  concentration  of  the  drug  in  solution.  Cisplatin  should  be 
prepared  in  saline  solutions  at a  NaCI  concentration  of 0.9%  or  higher when  being  prepared  for 
human intravenous use. Bicarbonate solution should be avoided. 

Sulfur  containing  compounds,  thiosulfates,  and  phosphorothioates  compose  a  group  of agents 
with  the  potential  to  improve  the  therapeutic  index  of  cisplatin  in  some  settings.  The  covalent 
binding of cisplatin  to  sulfur containing compounds of some group is the only direct interaction as 
yet described that seems to have some therapeutic significance. The approach, while interesting, 
has not yet been shown to improve response rates or extend survival. 

(Ill)  A number of cytotoxic anticancer agents are supra-additive or synergistic with  CDDP  in  vitro or in 

vivo including 5-FU, VP-16, a-interferon, tamoxifen and X-irradiation.

(5-FU) and COOP compared to the combination of COOP and 5-FU in patients with  metastatic or locally recurrent gastric cancer previously untreated with 
chemotherapy for advanced disease. 

The basis for 5-FU interaction with cisplatin is not clear.  No molecular explanation has been forthcoming 
for the CDDP VP-16 interaction, but it may result from  synergy of formation of cisplatin  DNA lesions and 
inhibition  of  topoisomerase  function.  Likewise,  the  cellular  molecular  interactions  of  cisplatin  with  a(cid:173)
interferon or x-irradiation have not been well studied. 
Synergistic  renal  toxicity  has  been  noted  with  aminoglycoside  antibiotics  such  as  gentamycin  or with 
cephalosporins.  Bleomycin,  methotrexate,  and  other  agents  that  are  eliminated  by  renal  excretion 
should be used with caution  in  patients who have renal  dysfunction secondary to cisplatin treatment.

1.2.4.  Clinical data 

Cisplatin entered clinical trials in  1971  and since then  has become established as a highly effective drug 
for treating testicular tumors, ovarian carcinomas and  head and  neck tumors. 
Toxicities are well known and are summarised  in  the following table:

Severe nephrotoxicity is  the  most important limiting toxicity of cisplatin. With the use of mannitol and 
saline hydration, this toxicity becomes more manageable although CDDP remains a nephrotoxic agent. 
Despite  these  measures,  irreversible  decrease  in  glomerular  filtration  occurs  and 
is  schedule 
dependant (  12 to 20% of GFR decrease at 20  mg/m 2  for five days,  20 to  32% with  bolus  doses of 50 
to  100 mg/m 2
,  ;::  35%  at 40  mg/m 2  for five  days).  Acute renal  tubular injury and  increased  excretion  of 
urinary  tubular  enzymes,  ~2 microglobulin  and  glucose  are  evident  at  1  to  6  days  after  therapy  but 
resolve by 1 to 3 weeks.  Hypomagnesemia develops in  about 75% of patients,  beginning 3 to 12 weeks 
after  therapy  and  persisting  for  months  to  year  in  40  %.  Hypomagnesemia  may  be  associated  with 
inappropriate  urinary  magnesium  excretion,  potassium  and  calcium  wasting  and  symptoms  such  as 
muscular  weakness,  tremulouness  and  dizziness.  Long  term  survivors  of  cisplatin  based  therapy 
exhibits chronic deficit of glomerular function and higher than  expected rates of arterial hypertension. 

Patient or treatment factors predicting increased risk of cisplatin nephrotoxicity are: 
•  pretreatment creatinine clearance< 75 ml/min 
•  age 60 years or old, 
•  size of individual dose 
•  cumulative cisplatin dose 
•  single dose compared with  daily x 5 administration schedule 
•  pretreatment serum uric acid  levels ;::  476 j..lmol/1 
•  pretreatment serum albumin level s 30 g/1 
•  peak plasma platinum concentration > 6 mg/1.

Cisplatin  is  the  most  emetogenic  agent  in  common  use.  Cisplatin  at  a  dosage  of  100  mg/m 2  given 
without  antiemetics  leads  to emesis  in  most patients  with  in  average  11  episodes  in  the  first 24  hours, 
beginning  at  2  or  3  hours  after  administration.  Patients  may  also  experience  nausea  and  vomiting 
beyond  the  first day of treatment (delayed emesis) or before  treatment (anticipatory emesis) and  other 
gastro-intestinal  symptoms  like  anorexia  and  diarrhea.  Fortunately,  nausea  and  vomiting  are  easily 
controlled by administration of ondansetron ± metoclopramide ± high dose dexamethasone. 

Although  neurotoxicity is  rarely fatal  with  CDDP,  it  can  result  in  severe  and  permanent disability.  The 
most common  neurotoxicities are peripheral  neuropathy and  hearing loss.  The reported  incidence of 
neurotoxicity  is  depending  on  the  severity  of neurotoxicity.  Subclinical  neurotoxicity  occurs  in  >  90% 
patients  receiving  more  than  300  mg/m2  or  more  and  undergoing  evaluation  of  vibration  sensation 
threshold.  First  signs  are  loss  of  vibration  sensation,  loss  of  ankle  jerks  and  painful  paresthesia  of 
hands  and  feet.  With  further treatment  there  is  a  proximal  progression  and  deficits  of proprioception, 
light  touch  and  pain.  Severe  cases  are  associated  with  sensory  ataxia,  disturbance  of  gait  and 
Rhomberg  's  sign.  Delayed  onset or progression  may occur several weeks  or months after completion 
of therapy.  Symptoms  may improve  for  2 weeks  to  27  months  after cisplatin  treatment  but  is  typically 
incomplete.  Monitoring  deep tendons  reflexes,  vibration  sensitivity or vibration  sensation  threshold  may 
detect  early  signs.  Slow  infusions,  use  of hypertonic  saline,  single  dose  as  opposed  to  divided  dose 
schedules  may reduce  the  severity of peripheral  neuropathy.  Clinical  trials  with  diethyldithiocarbamate 
have  shown  no  selective  protection  against  cisplatin 
in  humans  (11 ).  The 
corticotrophin  analogue  ORG  2766  prevents  the  onset  of  neurotoxicity  during  treatment  if  given 
concurrently with cisplatin (12, 13).

1.3. 

BACKGROUND ON  5-FU 

1.3.1.  Mechanism of action 
5-fluorouracil  basically acts as  a « false » pyrimidine  or antimetabolite to  ultimately inhibit the formation 
of  the  DNA-specific  nucleoside  base  thymidine.  The  agent  appears  to  successfully  compete  for  the 
enzyme thymidylate synthase by displacing natural substrate uracil deoxyribotide. 
5-fluorouracil,  thus  ,  is  similarly  handled  to  the  normal  uracile  substrate  for  activity  when  it  is  first 
converted  enzymatically through  several  steps to  the  ribonucleoside  and  ribonucleoitide.  This  ultimate 
metabolite  can  then  bind  selectively with  the  target enzyme  and  inhibit the  formation  of thymidine,  an 
essential  substrate for  DNA synthesis.  RNA synthesis  is  also  affected  in  a  lesser degree  by  inhibiting 
the utilisation of preformed uracil. 
5-fluorouracil is a cell  cycle phase specific agent with cytotoxic effects seen maximally in S phase. 

1.3.2.  Pharmacokinetic data 
The  two  main  routes  of fluorouracile  metabolism  in  man  are  intracellular  « activation »  to  the  active 
nucleoside  and  enzymatic  destruction  in  the  liver  due  to  dihydro  5-FU  dehydrogenase  with  ultimate 
conversion  to  inactive  metabolites:  C02 ,  urea,  fluoro-1)-alanine,  and  ammonia.  The  degradative 
enzymes are  diffusely distributed  and  are found  in  the gastro-intestinal epithelium  but apparently not in 
some colonic carcinoma. 
After  rapid  intravenous  injection  of  15  mg/kg,  peak  plasma  level  of 10-3-10-4  Mare achieved.  Primary 
half-life  is  8-14  min.  Plasmatic  level  then  decreased  rapidly  and  is  undetectable  after  1h.  The 
distribution  volume  is  about  25-33%  at  body weight.  Up  to  80  %  of a  dose  is  detoxified  via  metabolic 
degradation  in  the  liver,  with  significant  renal  excretion  occuring  after  the  first  few  hours.  Ultimately, 
from  60  to  80  of  radio-labelled  carbon  from  a  given  dose  is  excreted  through  the  lungs  as  carbon 
dioxide.  However less  than  10  %  of unchanged  drug  is  excreted  by  kidneys  with  90  % during  the first 
hour.  Depressed  renal  function  then  does  not  require  dosage  adjustement  for  5-FU.  Clarkson  et  al 
(1964)  found  that  when  given  as  a  continuous  infusion  (40-60mg/kg/24  h),  stable  plasma  levels  are 
obtained  and  less  intact  drug  appears  in  the  urine.  This  could  indicate  either  more  complete 
degradation to  inactive metabolites or enhanced conversion to the active nucleoside.

Fluorouracil  distributes  to  all  areas  of  body  water  apparently  by  simple  diffusion.  Thus  significant 
quantities of drug may enter the CNS and  after 15 mg/kg  i.v.  cerebrospinal fluids levels of 6-8 x  10-6  M 
are  obtained  after  30  min.  These  levels  persist  for  several  hours  and  slowly  subside.  Although 
distribution  to  brain  tissue  is  less  rapid,  abnormal  areas  such  those  with  neoplasms  may take  up  the 
drug  more  readily.  lntracarotid  and  intrathecal  administration  have  led  to  the  augmented  formation  of 
neurotoxic metabolites, fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate and are therefore not recommended. 
Fluorouracil  achieves  high  and  persistent  level  in  effusions  after  intravenous  administration.  Hepatic 
administration  through  the  portal  vein  or  hepatic  artery  also  achieves  high  concentrations  in  liver 
parenchyma and  produces relatively low systemic levels.

clearance  of  5-FU.  Within  individuals,  interferon-a  may  decrease  5-FU  clearance  in  a  dose  and

diarrhea.  Disruption  of  the  integrity  of  the  gut  lining  may  permit  access  of  enteric  organisms  into 
bloodstream with the potential overwhelming sepsis, particularly if the nadir coincides with diarrhea. 

I. V.  Bolus  daily  for  five  days  :  Mucositis  and  diarrhea  are  dose  limiting  although  significant 
granulocytopenia also may occur. 

Continuous  infusion  :  Mucositis  is  usually  dose  limiting  although  diarrhea  and  dermatitis  occur. 
Myelosuppression is generally mild to moderate in  severity. 

High dose over 24h-hour period: Gastro-intestinal and  neurotoxicity are limiting. 

Prolonged  Cl  of low  dose  5-FU  :  Mucositis  and  palma-plantar  erythrodysesthesia  are  dose  limiting, 
while diarrhea is  less common. 

1.3.3.2. Activity 

5-FU  is  the  most extensively studied  single  agent in  gastric carcinoma.  An  overall  response  rate  of 21 
%has been  reported. 
lnfusional  5-FU  is  of interest given  the  drug's  short  plasma  half-life and  because  a much  more higher 
dose intensity can  be achieved compared with bolus injections. 
5-fluorouracil has an  established efficacy in  the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer since 40 years 
and  modulation by folinic acid  has demonstrated the improvement of response rate (14). 
Considerable  effort  has  been  devoted  to  determine the  best  dose  and  schedules  for giving  5-FU  and 
leucovorin  in  combination.  No  consensus  opinion  has arisen,  and  several  studies demonstrated similar 
efficacy for patients receiving 5-FU  plus either high-dose or low-dose of leucovorin (15). 
A wide variety of regimens  of 5-FU  with  or without folinic  acid  is  in  current  use.The table  below  shows 
the most commonly used ones.

There  are  few comparative  studies  between  these  regimens,  and  response  rates  reported  in  individual 
studies vary widely,  makes comparisons  between  regimens  difficult.  Nevertheless the  5-day per month 
Mayo  Clinic  regimen  is  widely  regarded  as  the  standard  against which  other  regimens  are  compared 
(16). 

In  order to assess efficacy and toxicity afforded by biochemical modulation or schedule variation of 5-FU 
the  American  Southwest  Oncology  Group  designed  a  phase  II  study  (17)  comparing  7  different 
schedules  or  modulations of 5-FU  in  first  line  chemotherapy patients with  metastatic colorectal  cancer. 
The principal conclusions drawn from this study may be summarised as follows  : 

Bolus  administration  of  5-FU  was  associated  with  more  frequent  grade  3/4  haematological 
toxicity (47%) than infusion-based regimens (1-11 %) and weekly bolus. 
The continuous 5-FU low dose infusion (Lokich) was the best tolerated 
The frequency of grade 3/4 diarrhea was similar for daily x 5 regimens and for infusions, with  or 
without FA(= 11 %);  it was most frequent with weekly bolus plus high-dose FA (27%). 

Median  follow  up  time  was  37  months  and  survival  data  were  mature.  There  was  little  difference 
between any of the regimens in  progression-free survival times. The survival  results are thus consistent 
with  those  of the  1992  Meta-analysis  (Advanced  Colorectal  Meta-analysis  Project  1992)  in  finding  no 
survival  advantage with  the addition of FA to  5-FU,  regardless  of 5-FU  regimen  (see table).  Addition  of 
PALA to weekly 5-FU  infusion led to shorter survival and  an  increase in toxic deaths. 

There  is  authoritative  support for the  view  that  a Mayo  Clinic-type  regimen  of 5-FU  with  low-dose  FA 
should  be  considered  standard first-line treatment for advanced colorectal  cancer (16).  It is argued that 
the  Mayo regimen  offers the advantage of proven  superiority in  response  rate over 5-FU  alone without 
excessive  cost;  increasing  the  dose  of FA  increases  the  cost  substantially without  any  corresponding 
increase  in  benefit;  weekly  high-dose  regimens  cost  more  and  gain  little  or  nothing  compared  to  the 
Mayo regimen.  Nonetheless, many of the other regimens  mentioned above are  in widespread  use also, 
and  research  into new regimens and  modulations continues.

RATIONALE 

1 .4.1 .  Rationale for development in gastric cancer 

Stomach cancer is the second  leading cancer (after lung cancer) worldwide, despite declining incidence 
and  mortality  in  developed  countries  in  the  West.  By  contrast  the  incidence  of  proximal  tumors  is 
increasing (18). 
The  incidence  and  mortality  rates  of  gastric  cancer  vary  between  countries.  The  high-risk  countries 
include  large  part of Central  and  South  America,  as well  as  most countries  of the  Far East with  Japan 
being  the  leading  country.  There  is  an  intermediate  risk  in  Southern  and  Eastern  European  countries 
with  Portugal being the leading country by incidence ; the low-level risk countries are North America and 
the North-Western Europe. 
The  estimated  incidence  by stage  in  selected  European  countries  is  30-35%  at stage  I and  II  and  65-
70%  at  stage  III-IV  while  in  Japan  it  is  the  opposite  with  65-70%  at  an  early  stage  versus  30%  at 
advanced stage presumably due to a large aggressive screening program. 
Cure  for patients  with  gastric cancer is  only available for those  in  whom  a complete  surgical  resection 
can  be  performed:  this  is  possible for only 30 to  35%  of all  patients and  even  in  these patients,  relapse 
is  common.  The  level  of lymph-node  resection  is  an  important prognostic factor:  when  the  «en bloc» 
lymph  node  resection  is  performed,  the  5-year  survival  is  nearly 40%  which  is  much  better  than  that 
without lymph  node dissection (19).  The estimated  5-year relative survival  rates  by stage are: 65%  for 
stage  I,  20%  for stage  II,  10%  for stage  Ill  and< 1%  for stage  IV.  Advanced  disease  is  incurable and 
patients will be treated by chemotherapy. 

A number of effective chemotherapy combination  regimens  has  been  developed  using the  most active 
single  agents  in  advanced  and  metastatic  gastric  cancer.  Randomized  trials  versus  best  supportive 
care  have  shown  a  significant  gain  in  median  survival  with  polychemotherapy  (from  3  months  to  10 
months)  establishing  the  palliative  role  of  chemotherapy  in  advanced  stages.  Interesting  enough,  the 
survival  advantage  parrallels  improvement  of  quality  of  life  (performance  status,  tumor  related 
symptoms) and  appears to be cost effective (20,  21 ). 

FAM,  a combination  of 5-fluorouracil,  mitomycin C and  low doses of doxorubicin, was  the first regimen 
shown to be active with 30% response rate and a median survival of 5-9 months (22). 
FAMTX, where mitomycin has been  replaced  by high dose of methotrexate, has been the next standard 
for  treating  advanced  gastric  carcinoma(23)  ;  in  a  comparative  trial  versus  FAM,  FAMTX  induced  a 
significantly  higher  response  rate  (41  versus  9%)  and  a  significantly  longer  median  survival  time  (44 
versus 29 weeks) than  FAM  (24). 

Although  FAMTX  has been  considered  as  the  standard  therapy for a while,  this  is  no  longer true.  First 
of all,  FAMTX is a demanding regimen,  requiring multiple dosage of methotrexate, rescue of folinic acid 
until methotrexate levels are  below the toxicity threshold and alkalinisation of urine.  Secondly FAMTX is 
still  a  toxic  regimen  with  a  significant  rate  of hematotoxicity  and  infection.  For  these  reasons,  other 
second  generation  regimens  have  been  developed.  EAP  is  a  combination  of cisplatin  plus  etoposide 
and  doxorubicin.  However a randomized  trial  comparing  EAP to  FAMTX was stopped  early because of 
no apparent difference in  response,  but a significantly higher toxic death rate with  EAP (25). Wilke et a/ 
designed  the  etoposide  plus  leucovorin  and  5-FU,  ELF,  combination  for patients with  cardiac disorder 
or of advanced age who were not likely to  tolerate  EAP  or other anthracycline containing  regimen.  This 
combination  achieved  a  53%  response  rate  including  8%  complete  responses  and  a  median  survival 
time of 11  months was observed (26}. An  ongoing EORTC trial  is  currently comparing ELF  versus 5-FU 
and  cisplatin  versus  FAMTX  (27).  The  interim  analysis  showed  that  the  combination  of  5-FU  and 
cisplatin  has a higher response rate (27% versus 21% in the ELF group and  20%  in  the FAMTX group). 
However,  this  difference  is  not  statistically  significant.  In  a  recently  published  study  comparing  ECF 
(epirubicin  plus  5-FU  as  a  protracted  infusion  and  cisplatin)  to  FAMTX,  ECF  resulted  in  a  higher 
response  rate than  FAMTX (45%  versus 21 %)  and  in  a significant prolongation  of median survival time 
in  ECF group, 8.9 months versus 5.7 months (28). 
Although  this  is the only randomized trial  showing a regimen superior to  FAMTX, these results have not 
yet  been  confirmed;  moreover  the  contribution  of  epirubicin  to  the  combination  of  cisplatin  and 
infusional 5-FU remains debated.

However the  modest survival  advantage and  rather low response  rates with  a median duration  ranging 
between  6 and  9 months,  obviously indicate the  need  for new active agents and  regimens  against this 
poor prognosis disease. 

In  view  of  this  complex  situation  and  taking  into  account  that  this  trial  would  be  a  multicentre, 
multinational trial,  an  advisory board of experts in gastric cancer has been set up.This meeting was held 
in  Munich on  April 26,  1997. A consensus emerged on the following  points: 

1.  There is presently no standard regimen  in the treatment of gastric cancer. 
2. 

lnfusional  5-FU  seemed  to  be the way forward  but cisplatin  cannot be  ignored  as  it is  probably 
the second most important drug used in  Europe, much more used than  the anthracyclines. 

An  advisory board  with  american  experts  , held  in  New York  on  25th  July  1997,  expressed  the  same 
opinion,  confirming  the  worth  of selecting  CDDP  and  infusional  5-FU  as  the  comparator  for  this  trial. 
Finally,  it  should  be  mentioned  that there  is  an  ongoing  randomized  trial  of EORTC comparing weekly 
high dose 5-FU ± L-Folinic acid (HD-FU/FA) versus HD-FU/FA plus biweekly cisplatin versus FAMTX in 
advanced  gastric cancer:  interim  results  are  awaited  in  March  98.  The  FAMTX arm  has  been  stopped 
due to the high level of toxicity (Wilke, personal communication).

As  shown  in  table 7,  5-FU + CDDP yielded  a response rate between 24% and 51%.  The activity seems 
superior  in  comparative  trials  to  FAMTX  or  FAM.  On  the  basis  of the  available  phase  II  data,  median 
survival  is  slightly superior to 8 months.  Its safety profile shows less hematological toxicity than  FAMTX 
and  ECF,  comparable mucositis,  but higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy. 
Two  investigational  arms  have  been  selected  for  this  phase  11/111  trial:  docetaxel  plus  CDDP  and 
docetaxel  plus  CDDP  and  5-FU  based  on  the  potential  synergism  of  cisplatin  and/or  5-FU  with 
docetaxel. 

Given  the  potential  synergism  and  spectrum  of activity  of Taxotere®,  5-FU  and  CDDP,  a phase  I has 
been  set up  in  order to  determine the  maximal tolerated  dose of the combination  of these three drugs. 
Taxotere® is administered as a 1 hour infusion day 1 q 3 week,  CDDP 30 min i.v.  d1  q3 week and  5-FU 
as  a 5 day continuous  infusion day 1-5 q 3 week associated with a five day steroid premedication. MTD 
was  defined  as  grade  3-4  NCI-CTG  non  haematological  toxicity  or  febrile  neutropenia  or  grade  4 
neutropenia of more than  7 days. 
So  far  21  patients  with  solid  tumors  have  been  accrued,  with  10  patients  suffering  of squamous  cell 
,  CDDP  100  mg/m 2  and  5-FU  750 
carcinomas  of the  head  and  neck.  At  the  level  Taxotere® 75  mg/m 2
,  3  out  of 6  patients  have  presented  dose  limiting  toxicities  : one  patient experienced  diarrhoea 
mg/m2
and  stomatitis  grade  3,  another  diarrhea  grade  3  and 
the  last  one  febrile  neutropenia.  The 
recommended dose for phase  II  trials  is Taxotere® 75 mg/m 2
,  CDDP 75  mg/m2  and  5-FU  750  mg/m2  x 
5.  Excellent activity has been observed in  4 out of 6 evaluable patients.

1.4.2.  Rationale for the selection of the test arm TXT+CDDP+5-FU for the phase Ill part 

1.4.2.1. Phase II results on the first 60 evaluable patients 

According to  the  phase  II  design chosen,  the  selection  of the  test arm  for phase  Ill was to be made on 
the first 60 eveluable patients on the phase II  part. Two populations were analysed  : 

-1. The «full analysis » population which consists of all treated patients analysed by randomisation arm. 

-2.  The « per protocol » population which consists of eligible,  treated and  evaluable for efficacy patients 

without major protocol deviation during study. 

The  arm  A  relates  to  the  TXT +CDDP  combination  whereas  arm  B  reports  to  the  TXT +CDDP+5-FU 
combination. 

Study Overview 

The first thirty five patients randomised  in each arm  were taken into account for this analysis. Thirty four 
patients in  arm  A and 35 patients in  arm  Bare constituting the «full analysis population »:  one patient in 
arm A was not treated. The « per protocol  population » is including 31  patients in  arm A and  29 patients 
in  arm  B.  One  patient  was  non  eligible  (non  metastatic disease},  two  patients  were  non  evaluable  for 
response  and  one  patient  was  neither  eligible  nor  evaluable  for  response  in  arm  A.  In  arm  B,  five 
patients  were  non  evaluable  for  response  rate  and  one  patient  had  a  major  protocol  violation  during 
study. 

Reasons for treatment discontinuation are described in the following table.

Drug delivery 

One  hundred sixty three cycles  in  arm  A and  161  cycles  in  arm  B have been  administered. The median 
number  of  cycles  was  five  in  each  arm  (range  in  arm  A  :  1-9  ;  range  in  arm  B  :  1-9).  The  median 
duration  of the  treatment was  15.9 weeks  in  arm  A (range  : 3.3-30.6) and  15.4 weeks  in  arm  B (range 
3.4-29.9). The number of patients by cycles is also very similar in  both arms. 

In  the  docetaxel  and  cisplatin  combination,  the  actual  median  dose  intensity  was  27.4  mg/m 2/week 
(range  20.16-29.30)  for  docetaxel  and  24.14  mg/m 2/week  (range  :  14.4-25.91)  for  CDDP.  In  the 
docetaxel,  cisplatin  and  5-FU  combination,  the  actual  median  dose  intensity  was  23.87  mg/m 2/week 
(range:  15.83-26.27)  for  docetaxel,  23.87  mg/m 2/week  (range:  16.28-26.29) for  CDDP  and  1192.83 
mg/m 2/week (range: 273.4-1380.61) for 5-FU. 

The relative dose intensity was 0.97 for both drugs in arm A and was 0.95 for the three drugs in arm  B. 

Doses were reduced for hematological toxicity in  5.9%  of the patients and  1.2% of the cycles  ; for non(cid:173)
hematological toxicity, dose were reduced  in  23.5% of the patients and 5.5% of the cycles in arm A . 
In  arm  B,  doses were reduced for hematological toxicity in 2.9% of the patients and 0.6% of the cycles  ; 
concerning  non-hematological  toxicity,  dose  were  reduced  in  22.9%  of the  patients  and  7.5%  of the 
cycles as reported  by investigator. 
The  analysis  of  the  dose  reduction  as  per  actual  dose  received  shows  that  doses  were  reduced  in 
26.5% of the patients in arm  A and 34.3% of the patients in arm  B.

As reported by investigator 

Concerning  grade  3-4  neutropenia,  93.8%  patients  (72.3%  of cycles)  in  arm  A  experienced  this  toxicity 
compared to 82.9% of the patients (50.0% of cycles) in  arm  B.  In  arm  A 34.4%  of patients (12%  of cycles) 
experienced  grade  3-4  anemia  versus  25.7%  (5.9%  of  cycles)  of  patients  in  arm  B.  No  septic  death 
occured.  Grade  3-4  related  infections  were  observed  in  2.9%  of patients  (1.8%  of cycles)  in  arm  A  and 
5.7% (1.9% of cycles) in  arm  B.  Febrile neutropenia were observed  in  11.8% of patients (2.5% of cycles) in 
arm  A  and  22.9%  of  patients  (6.2%  of  cycles)  in  arm  B.  Infection  with  concomitant  neutropenia  was 
observed in  14.7% (4.3% of cycles) of patients in  arm A and 5.7%  (1.9% of cycles) in  arm  B. 

The biochemical tolerance was good. 

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 

Out of the  69  treated  patients  randomised  in  the trial,  93  SAEs  occured  in  34  patients  : 33  SAEs were 
observed  in  15  patients  of arm  A  and  60  SAEs  were  observed  in  19  patients  of arm  B.  In  arm  A,  22 
SAEs of 12 patients were probably related to the study-drug, 4 SAEs in 3 patients were remotely related 
and 7 SAEs in  2 patients were not related.  In  arm  B,  38 SAEs in  14 patients were probably drug-related, 
4 SAEs  in  3 patients were  possibly related,  4 SAEs in  3 patients were  remotely related  and  14 SAEs in 
8  patients  were  not  study-drug  related.  Three  deaths,  two  in  arm  A- one  in  arm  B,  occured  within  30 
days from  last injection  (see study overview);  seven  deaths (four in  arm  A and  three  in  arm  B) occured 
after this period of 30 days from last injection, all the latter malignant disease related. 

1.4.2.2. Selection of the test arm for the phase Iff by the IDMC 

These results were presented at the IDMC during a meeting held  in  Chicago on August 17th, 1999. 

After  a  careful  review  of the  data,  the  IDMC  recommended  to  start  the  phase  Ill  and  to  pick  up  the

STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 

• 

In the Phase II  part 

Primary : to  select one  of the  2 test arms  (docetaxel  with  cisplatin,  docetaxel with  cisplatin  and  5-FU), 
based  primarily  on  complete  responses,  to  advance  to  a  phase  Ill  survival  comparison  against  the 
CDDP + 5-FU control arm. 

Secondary :to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative safety profile of the 2 test groups. 

• 

In the Phase Ill  part 

Primary  :  to  detect  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  time  to  progression  (TTP)  for  the  test  arm 
(TXT +CDDP+5-FU) relative to the control  arm (CDDP+5-FU). 

Main  secondary  :  to  detect  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  overall  survival  (OS)  for  the  test  arm 
(TXT +CDDP+5-FU) relative to the control arm (CDDP+5-FU). 
Other  secondary  :  to  compare  response  rates,  time  to  treatment  failure,  duration  of  response,  safety 
profiles, quality of life and  disease-related symptoms. 

Socio-economic  data  will  be  collected  in  order  to  be  able  to  perform  an  analysis  by  country  when 
needed.

OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 

3.1. 

DESCRIPTION AND  RATIONALE OF THE DESIGN 

This is a prospective, multicentre, multinational, non  blinded,  randomized phase 11/111  study. 

The Phase II  part of the  study is  a selection design. The goal  is to select 1 of the 2 investigational arms 
for the  Phase  Ill part of the  study based  on  the highest observed  complete response  rate.  The ultimate 
selection will  be  based on  an overall benefiUrisk assessment. 

The  Phase  Ill  part of the  study will  compare the survival  between  the  selected  investigational  arm  and 
the  control  arm.  A  closed  testing  procedure  will  be  used  to  combine  a  test  of  superiority  of  the 
investigational arm  relative to the control  and a test of equivalence between the investigational arm  and 
the control with  respect to survival. 

3.2. 

STUDY CENTERS 

This  is  a  multicentre,  international  study  planned  to  involve  610  patients.  Approximately  100  centers 
from  Belgium,  Germany,  Italy,  Portugal,  Spain,  Slovak  Republic,  Russia,  Turkey,  Canada,  US, 
Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  Columbia,  Mexico,  Peru,  Venezuela  and  Tarwan  will  accrue  patients.  Each 
center is expected to enter at least 8-10 patients. 

3.3. 

REFERENCE COMMITTEES 

3.3.1. 

lndependant Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 

An  lndependant Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be set in  order to  : 

assess  safety and  efficacy  issues  in  this  study in  case  of concerns  about the  safety of docetaxel 
containing  test  arms.  The  available  data  on  adverse  events  incidence  and  severity  should  be 
reviewed  in  order to  decide  which  measure  should  be  appropriate  or  not  in  order to  address  any 
specific issue on safety, 
discuss methodological aspects if needed, 
decide which  experimental  arm  out of the two  tested  should  be  further continued  in  the  phase  Ill 
part, 
review the interim analysis data for the phase Ill.

other aspects  in  addition  to  the  selection of the test arm  for phase  Ill and  the  interim  analysis of phase 
Ill.  Two  investigators'  representatives,  the  clinical  project  leader,  the  associate  clinical  project  leader, 
the  project  statistician  and  the  study  manager will  constitute  the  executive  committee.  The  role  of the 
executive  committee  is  to  provide  to  the  IDMC  the  adequate  information  for  the  decision-making 
process as well  as  to  answer to  any particular issue that the IDMC would  raise.  The  IDMC will  make its 
deliberation  in  a  closed  session  and  the  minutes  of the  IDMC  closed  session  will  be  kept  confidential 
until the end  of the trial. The decisions of the IDMC will  be transmitted to the executive committee.

3.3.2.  External Response Review Committee (ERRC) 

An  External  Response  Review  Committee  (ERRC)  will  be  set  up  for  the  assessment  of  tumor 
response.  This  Committee will  consist of members  all  experts  in  the evaluation  of gastric cancer : two 
expert radiologists  not involved  in  the  study and  at least one  investigator from  the  study or one medical 
expert.  They should  meet regularly in  order to  provide data  on  time for the selection  of the test arm  for 
phase  Ill,  the  final  results  of the  whole  phase  II,  the  phase  Ill  interim  analysis  and  the  phase  Ill  final 
analysis. 

Should  discrepancies  occur  between  the  algorithm  on  tumor  assessment  established  by  the  RPR 
statistician  as  a  validation  tool  and  the  assessment  of  either  the  investigators  or  the  experts 
investigators  and/or  the  panel,  they  will  be  documented  and  re-evaluated  during  a  final  patient 
assessment. 
Discrepancies which  might occur are categorised as follows: 

Discrepancy type  1 : 

- Minor differences in  measurement present but panel's decision not different from  the 

investigator's evaluation on the following items : 
organs involved, 
overall response by each cycle, 
response by each organ involved, 
date of disease progression, 
best overall response. 

Discrepancy type 2: 

- Panel decision differs from the investigator's opinion for one or more points listed above and 

the investigator will be asked to approve the change 

Response  Review Form,  properly signed  by the  radiologists  and  by the  investigator will  be  attached  to 
the internal patient file. 
For this  reason,  all  radiological  documents necessary for tumor evaluation must be duplicated at 
the  time  of examination  and  be  available  for  the  members  of the  committee within  two  weeks 
before

progression should  be  ruled  out by physical, biological  and  radiological assessments of the tumor 
lesions.  If radiotherapy  (for whatever  reason)  becomes  necessary and  the  area  to  be  irradiated 
cannot  avoid  a  lesion  being  the  only  uni  or  bidimensionally  measurable  or  the  only  evaluable 
lesion,  the  patient  must go  off protocol.  However,  patients  may  continue  to  receive  treatment  if 
they are responding. 

Significant protocol violations including  : 
-failure to  perform assessments for tumor measurement or, 
- the  appearance of any  of the  exclusion  criteria  (see  section  4.3) not related  to  toxicities of the 
study drugs  (ie.  development of a significant psychiatric disorder which  would  affect the status of

5.2.1.  Randomisation 

After  having  properly  checked  all  eligibility  criteria,  obtained  patient  informed  consent  and  baseline 
quality of life  questionnaire  filled  in,  patients  will  be  randomized  in  the  study.  A  patient  who  has  been 
treated prior to registration will not be accepted for the study. 

Randomisation  process will  be centralized  in  RPR Recherche-Developpement offices.  For details,  refer 
to section 6.8. 

5.2.2. 

Inclusion 

Up to 610 patients should be entered (see section 9.1 ). 

5.2.3.  Duration of treatment and Follow-up 

Treatment should  be  administered  up  to  progression,  unacceptable toxicities or withdrawal  of consent.  The 
reason  and  date  of removal  of  all  patients  will  be  documented  on  the  case  report  form  (e.g.  lost  to 
follow-up,  withdraw  consent,  patient  wrongly  included,  adverse  events,  etc.).  The  investigator  will 
attempt  to  complete  all  discharge  procedures  at  the  time  a  patient  is  removed  from  the  treatment. 
Further anti-cancer therapy and overall best response to the further anti-cancer therapy will be recorded 
in  the case report form. 
After progression, further chemotherapy treatment with  taxanes or camptothecins is  not recommended. 
Cross  over  is  not allowed.  After end  of treatment for  progression,  patients  will  be  followed  every 3 
months  until  death.  Patients  who  have  ended  treatment  but  not  yet  progressed  (e.g.  unacceptable 
toxicities  or  withdrawal  of consent)  will  be  followed  every  8  weeks  after  the  end  of  treatment  until 
documented  progression  and  every  3  months  after  progression  ;  DATE  OF  DEATH  OR 
PROGRESSION should be reported whenever it occurs.

DOSE MODIFICATION AND  DOSE DELAY 

Doses  will  be  modified  in  case  of  severe  hematological  and/or  non  hematological  toxicities.  Dose 
adjustments are to be  made according to the system  showing the greatest degree of toxicity.  Toxicities 
will  be  graded  using  the  NCIC-CTG  criteria  (see  APPENDIX  II}.  Some  toxicities  prompt  more  than  one 
drug in the combination to be reduced in dose e.g. diarrhea. 

When  used  as  single  agent,  the  major toxic  effect of docetaxel  which  limits  dose  is  neutropenia. 
Other  toxic  effects  which  may  be  seen  include  anaphylactoid  type  reactions  and  cutaneous 
reactions,  digestive  tract  toxicities  (nausea,  vomiting,  oral  mucositis,  diarrhea),  reversible 
paresthesias,  alopecia,  asthenia, and  mild  local venous reactions  {phlebitis) at site of injection and 
fluid  retention/edema.  The  guidelines  which  follow  outline  dose  adjustments  for  several  of these 
toxic effects. 

The  major  dose  limiting  toxicities  observed  with  single  agent  cisplatin  are  nausea  and  vomiting, 
peripheral neuropathy and  nephrotoxicity. 

The  dose-limiting  toxicity  observed  with  5-FU  as  a  continuous  infusion  is  mucositis.  Dermatitis 
{hand-foot  syndrome)  and  diarrhea  are  also  frequently  observed.  Myelosuppression  is  generally 
mild to moderate in  severity. Cardiac toxicity may occur. 

IF  A  PATIENT  EXPERIENCES  SEVERAL  TOXICITIES  AND  THERE  ARE  CONFLICTING 
RECOMMENDATIONS,  PLEASE  FOLLOW  THE  MOST  CONSERVATIVE  DOSE  ADJUSTMENT 
RECOMMENDED  (DOSE  REDUCTION  APPROPRIATE TO THE MOST SEVERE TOXICITY).  NOTE 
THAT  THE  DOSES  WHICH  HAVE  BEEN  REDUCED  FOR  TOXICITY  MUST  NOT  BE  RE(cid:173)
ESCALATED. 
TWO  CONSECUTIVE  DOSE  REDUCTIONS  WILL  BE  APPLIED  IN  CASE  OF  TOXICITY  ;  IF 
DESPITE  DOSE  REDUCTIONS  AND/OR  A  MAXIMUM  OF  TWO  WEEK  DELAY,  THE  SAME

Once the dose was reduced  due to  impaired  liver function,  no further dose reduction  is  recommended 
if no worsening of the parameters is observed. 
In  case  of recovery  of liver function  tests  on  the following  cycle,  the  dose  can  be  re-escalated  to  the 
previous dose-level. 

6.6.3.  Cisplatin dose adjustments 

a)  Peripheral neuropathy 

A  neurological examination  must be performed  by the same physician (if possible} before entry into the 
study,  then  at least every 2  cycles  and  when  the  patient goes off study.  In  case of symptoms or signs 
experienced by the patient,  more frequent examinations should be performed and dose modification will 
be as follows  : 

Grade 0,1 
Grade 2 
Grade 3 

:no change 
: only cisplatin will be reduced by 20%. 
: patient will go off protocol therapy 

The same guidelines apply also for patients with grade 1 neuropathy at baseline.

In  case  of  rise  of  serum  creatinine  ~ grade  2  (more  than  1.5  x  normal  value)  despite  adequate 
rehydration,  a  creatinine  clearance  should  be  performed  before  each  cycle  and  subsequent  dose 
reductions will  be considered as follows  : 

-

If the  clearance  of creatinine (CCI)  is ~ 60  ml/min  : the  full  dose  will  be  given  and  CCI  will  be 
repeated before each cycle. 
If  the  CCI  is  between  40  and  59  mllmin,  the  dose  of  cisplatin  will  be  reduced  by  50%  at 

-
subsequent cycle.  In  case of no recovery, cisplatin will  be omitted in the next cycle 

If CCI  is< 40 ml/min, cisplatin will be omitted  in that cycle only

then docetaxel will be reduced by 20%. 
In  case of grade 4 diarrhea, 5-FU  and  docetaxel will  be  reduced  by 20%.  In  case of recurrent grade 
4 diarrhea, the patient will  go off study. 

c)  Plantar-palmar syndrome 

Toxicity  with  plantar-palmar  syndrome  erythema  is  observed  with  continuous  infusional  5-FU.  Its 
occurrence  and  severity  seems  to  be  alleviated  by  concomitant  administration  of vitamin  86  p.o.  In 
case of grade ~ 2 plantar-palmar toxicity,  5-FU  should  be  stopped up to recovery.  5-FU dosage should 
then be adapted according to the following guidelines: 

Grade 1: 
Grade~ 2: 

No change 
Reduce 5-FU by 20% 

6.6.5.  Other toxic effects 

Other toxic effects should be managed symptomatically if possible. 
For  ~ grade  3  toxicities  except  alopecia  and  anemia  (see  APPENDIX  II),  combination  chemotherapy 
should  be  held  for  a  maximum  of  two  weeks  from  the  planned  date  of  reinfusion  until  resolution  to 
~grade 1,  then  reinstituted,  if  medically  appropriate.  A  dose  reduction  will  be  discussed  between 
investigator and sponsor.

6.7. 
CISPLATIN (NO DOSE MODIFICATION REQUIRED) 

GUIDELINES  FOR  THE  MANAGEMENT  OF  TOXICITIES  SPECIFIC  OF  DOCETAXEL  AND 

a)  Nausea and/or vomiting (docetaxel or cisplatin) 

Prophylactic  antiemetic  regimen  is  recommended  from  the  first  cycle.  In  addition,  the  corticosteroids 
given  for 3 days for the  prophylaxis  of fluid  retention,  HSR and  skin  toxicity should reduce furthermore 
the incidence and severity of emesis with docetaxel treatment. 
Patients  with  nausea  and  vomiting  despite  these  measures  may be  treated  with  an  other antiemetic 
regimen  (i.e.  high  dose  metoclopramide)  as  appropriate.  Corticosteroids  alone  or in  combination  with 
other antiemetic drugs are not permitted as supportive treatment for nausea and/or vomiting. 

b)  Anaphylactoid type reactions, hypersensitivity reactions {docetaxel or cisplatin) 

In  the event that a  hypersensitivity reaction  occurs  despite  premedication,  it is  then  very likely to  occur 
within  few  minutes  of start of the first or of the  second  infusion  of docetaxel.  Therefore,  during  the  1st 
and  the 2nd  infusions,  a careful  evaluation  of general sense of well  being and whenever possible blood 
pressure and  heart rate  monitoring will  be  performed  by a physician  for at least the first  10 minutes. so 
that immediate intervention would occur in  response to symptoms of an  untoward reaction. 

Facilities  and  equipment for  resuscitation  will  be  immediately available  : antihistamine,  corticosteroids, 
aminophylline, epinephrine. 
If a  reaction  occurs,  the  specific treatment  that  can  be  medically  indicated  for a  given  symptom  (e.g. 
epinephrine  in  case  of  anaphylactic  shock,  aminophylline  in  case  of  bronchospasm,  etc.)  will  be 
instituted.  In  addition, it is recommended to take the measures listed below:

Hypersensitivity  reactions  following  treatment  with  cisplatin  are  rare  and  usually  observed  after  the 
patient has received 6 cycles or more of cisplatin.  In  addition, the routine use of dexamethasone for the 
prophylaxis  of cisplatin  induced  emesis  may effectively prevent  the  occurence  of HSR.  If despite the 
prophylactic  premedication  proposed  in  this  protocol,  an  HSR  occurs,  the  same  action  and  specific 
treatment as for docetaxel induced AHSR will  be instituted.

c)  Peripheral edemas and/or effusions (docetaxel) 

Fluid retention : 
In  case  fluid  retention  occured  during  the  treatment  despite  the  use  of premedication  with 
corticosteroids,  the  symptoms  and  signs  should  be  graded  according  to  the  NCIC-CTG 
expanded common toxicity criteria. 

No DOSE  REDUCTION  IS  PLANNED.  The  weight will  be  recorded  and  followed  to  document any 
weight gain which could be related to edema. 

Recommended curative treatment : 

Curative  treatment  should  commence when  the  patient developes  fluid  retention  with  NCIC 
grade ~ 2.  The following  treatment is  recommended  in  an  attempt to continue treatment with 
study drug. 

Spironolactone 

1 00 mg/day by oral route 

If  the  symptoms  cannot  be  controlled  adequately  i.e.  worsening  of  the  fluid  retention  or  spread  to 
another area, furosemide at the dose of 20 to 40 mg/day p.o. can be added. 
The  clinical  tolerance  of  the  patient,  the  overall  tumor  response  and  the  medical  judgement  of  the 
investigator will  determine  if it  is  in  the  patient's  best  interest  to  continue  or to  discontinue  the  study 
drug.  It  is  recommended,  however,  that  patients  with  grade  ~ 3  fluid  retention  should  be 
withdrawn.

In  case  of difficulty to  make  a judgment whether the  effusion  would  be  disease  related  or study  drug 
related,  the treatment should  be continued until progressive disease in other organs is documented. 

d)  Extravasation (docetaxel) 

No  severe  extravasation  reactions  have  been  observed  so  far  with  docetaxel.  As  a  general 
recommendation,  in  the event of extravasation, the following advice should be observed  : 

1.  Stop the infusion immediately. 

2.  Do not remove the needle or cannula. 

3.  Aspirate with  the  same  needle  as  much  infiltrated  drug  as  possible from  the  subcutaneous 

site.

(5-FU) and  CDDP compared to the combination of CDDP and 5-FU  in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent gastric cancer previously untreated with 
chemotherapy for advanced disease. 

Evaluable  for  response:  Patients  will  be  assessed  for  tumor  response  every  8  weeks  and  will  be 
considered  as  evaluable for tumor response after having received  at least 2 cycles of treatment, with  at 
least a  complete  follow  up  tumor assessment with  the  same  imaging  procedures  as  baseline for each 
lesion,  unless  early progression  occurs  in  which  case they will  be  considered  evaluable  (in  progressive 
disease).  Patients on  therapy for at least this  period will  have their response classified  according to  the 
definitions set out below. 

57 of 109 

Tumor assessment for all  lesions must be  performed every 8 weeks on  therapy until the documentation 
of the  progression.  Tumor response  should  be  reported  on  follow-up  visits  every  8 weeks,  calculated 
from the first treatment administration, for the patient who goes off study for other reason than PD. 

No  further  antitumor  therapy  should  be  given  after  end  of  treatment  until  disease  progression  is 
documented,  except  if  the  patient  requests  further  therapy  or  the  investigator  deems  it  necessary. 
Further chemotherapy with taxanes or camptothecins is not recommended. 

7.1.2.2. Response criteria 

All  uni  or  bidimensionally  measurable  lesions  should  be  measured  every  subsequent  8  weeks. 
Additional  assessments  should  be  performed  to  confirm  a  response  at  least  28  days  after  the  first 
response  has  been  observed.  In  addition,  extra  assessments  may  be  perfomed  if  there  is  a  clinical 
suspicion of progression. 
When  multiple  lesions  are  present,  this  may  not  be  possible  and,  under such  circumstances,  up  to  6 
measurable  target  lesions  which  are  representative  of all  organs  involved  should  be  selected  for  the 
involved  sites,  giving  the  priority  to  bidimensionally  measurable  lesions,  then  unidimensionally 
measurable lesions. 
All  evaluable  and  non  evaluable  lesions  have  to  be  reported  and  assessed  every subsequent 56  days 
and to confirm a response. 
All  records  of patients  must  be  available  for  source  verification  and  may be  submitted  for  extramural 
review for final  assessment of tumour activity. 

7.1.3.  WHO criteria for measurement of response 

7. 1. 3. 1.  Bidimensional/y or unidimensional/y measurable disease : 

Complete response (CR)  : disappearance of all  known disease, determined by 2 observations not less 
than  4 weeks apart (it means that an  intermediate visit with  appropriate  investigations must be  planned 
4 weeks ahead from the day when the CR has been assessed). No new lesion should appear. 

Partial  response  (PR)  :  in  case  of bidimensionally  measurable  disease,  decrease  by at  least  50%  of 
the sum  of the  products  of the  largest perpendicular diameters of all  measurable lesions as  determined 
by  2  observations  not  less  than  4  weeks  apart  (it  means  that  an  intermediate  visit  with  appropriate 
investigations  must  be  planned  4  weeks  ahead  from  the  day when  the  PR  has  been  assessed).  For 
unidimensionally measurable disease,  decrease by at  least 50%  in  the sum  of the  largest diameters of 
all  lesions  as  determined  by  2  observations  not  less  than  4  weeks  apart  (see  above  for  assessment 
time).  It  is  not necessary for  all  lesions  to  have  regressed  to  qualify for partial  response,  but  no  lesion 
should  have  progressed  and  no  lesion  should  appear.  Serial  evidence  of  appreciable  change 
documented  by  radiography  or  photography  must  be  obtained  and  must  be  available  for  subsequent 
review. The assessment must be objective.

lesions.  For 
unidimensionally measurable disease,  < 50%  decrease and  < 25% increase in  the sum of the diameter 
of all  lesions.  No  new  lesions  should  appear.  The  patient  must  have  at  least  one  tumor  assessment 
after  a  minimum  of  36  days  on  study  treatment  from  the  first  infusion  to  be  assigned  in  the  « no 
change »  category.

Progressive  disease  (PO) 
the  size  of  at  least  one  bidimensionally  or 
unidimensionally measurable lesion  (in  comparison  with  the measurements at Nadir) or appearance of 
a new lesion.  The occurence of pleural  effusion  or ascites  is  also  considered  as  progressive disease if 
this  is  substantiated  by positive  cytology.  Pathological  fracture  or collapse  of bone  are  not necessarily 
evidence  of disease  progression.  Assignment  to  the  progression  category  is  done  after 36  days  from 
entry  into  the  study.  When  the  progression  is  observed  before  36  days  after  entry  into  the  study,  the 
patient will  be considered as an  "early progression". 

Development of brain  metastasis : 

The development of brain metastasis will  be considered as a sign of progression  ; even  if the disease is 
responding  outside  the  brain.  However,  the  investigator  may  chose  to  continue  the  study  drug  if  the 
patient is responding  elsewhere. 

7.1.3.2.  Evaluable not measurable disease 

Complete response : Complete disappearance of all  known disease for at least four weeks. 

Partial response : Estimated decrease in  tumour size of 50% or more for at least four weeks. 

No change  : No significant change as assessed after a minimum of 36 days on study treatment from  the 
first  infusion.  This  includes  stable  disease,  estimated  decrease  of  less  than  50%  and  lesions  with 
estimated increase of less than 25%. 

Progressive disease  :Appearance of any new lesions not previously identified or estimated  increase of 
25% or more in  existent lesions. 

7.1.3.3. Not evaluable lesions 

Complete response : Complete disappearance of all  known  disease for at least four weeks.  In  the case 
of blastic bone lesions,  bone scintigraphy must also be normalized for 4 weeks. 

No change : Neither complete response or progressive disease. 

Progressive disease :Appearance of any new lesions  not previously identified or estimated  increase of 
25% or more in  existent lesions.  In  the case of effusions, an  increase in size alone should  not determine 
progressive disease in  the absence of other lesions also in  PD.

7.1.5.  Determination of best overall response 

Best  overall  response  is  the  best  response  designation  recorded  from  the  start  of  treatment  until 
disease progression. 
Complete and  partial  responses  have to  be  confirmed  by two evaluations of the disease,  taken  at least 
4 weeks apart (see above for assessment time). 
No change is only accepted if it is  measured at least 36 days after the treatment start. 

7.1.6.  Response duration, time to progression, time to treatment failure and survival 

Tumor response,  time to  progression,  time to treatment failure  and  survival will  be  analyzed  both  on  an 
intent-to-treat basis and on the evaluable population. 

The period for complete response lasts from  the  date the complete response was  achieved  to  the date 
thereafter on  which  progressive disease is  first noted.  In  those patients who achieved partial  response, 
only the  period  of overall  response  should  be  recorded.  The  period  of overall  response  lasts from  the 
day of randomisation to the date of first observation of progressive disease. 

Time  to  progression  is  the  time  measured  from  the  day  of randomisation  to  the  first  progression  or 
death,  whichever occurs first.  Patients that have  not progressed  at the time of the final  analysis will  be 
censored  at the  date of their last tumor assessment.  Patients who  receive non-study antitumor therapy 
before disease progression will  be censored at the date of the last assessment before therapy. 

Time  to  treatment  failure  is  the  time  measured  from  the  day of  randomisation  to  the  date  of failure 
(progression, relapse, death or any other cause of treatment discontinuation. 

Survival  will  be  measured  from  the  date  of randomisation  to  the  date  of  death  from  whatever cause. 
Patients alive as of the final  analysis will be censored at their last contact date. 

7.1.7.  Evaluation of clinical  benefit 

In  addition  to  response  rate  and  time  to  progression,  the  evolution  of  Karnofsky  performance  status, 
appetite,  weight,  pain-free survival  and  quality of life will  be  compared  between  the  two  groups  in  order 
to establish the clinical benefit from  treatment. 

-Changes in  appetite and weight will  be  recorded  in  the  CRF at each  cycle and will  be  compared to 

baseline. The analysis will be per actual weight reported in the CRF by cycle. 

-Pain free  survival  : pain will  be recorded  in  the adverse event form of the CRF.  It is defined only for 
patients with  NCIC grade 0 pain  at baseline,  as  the  interval  from  randomisation to  the  appearance 
at one time of grade 1 or greater pain. 

- Karnofsky performance status will  be recorded  in  the CRF at each  cycle.  Changes will  be analyzed 

compared to baseline. 

7.2. 

SAFETY ASSESSMENT METHODS 

7 .2.1. 

Clinical safety 

The following tests will be performed prior to and/or on  specified days during and following therapy : 

Complete  history  of  events  related  to  malignant  and  non-malignant  diseases  including  known 
hypersensitivity reactions. 

Full  clinical  examination,  height,  weight,  assessment  of residual  toxicity  due  to  prior  therapy and 
disease  symptoms  according  to  NCIC-CTG  criteria,  performance  status  according  to  Karnofsky 
index. 

Neurologic examination is required at baseline and during treatment if clinically indicated. 

Adverse  events/signs  and  symptoms  of  disease:  each  patient  will  be  regularly  assessed  for  potential 
adverse events  and  disease related  signs  and  symptoms  according to  the  NCIC-CTG  common  toxicity

QUALITY OF LIFE EVALUATION 

Instruments : 

The  EORTC  QLQ-C30  (version  3.0)  and  the  EuroQoL  (EQ-50)  instruments will  be  used  in  this  study. 
The  QLQ-C30  is  a  cancer  specific  instrument  that  comprises  30  questions  and  provides  a  multi(cid:173)
dimensional assessment of QoL.  It is self administered and  takes about 5-10  minutes to fill  in  (34). The 
validity and  reliability of the QLQ-C30  have been  established  in  various types of cancers  (35).  The  EQ-
50 is  a measure of health  status that is  applicable to  a wide range of health conditions and  treatments 
(36).  The EQ-50 comprises 5 questions and  a visual  analog  scale.  It is self administered by the patient 
and  takes  about  1 minute  to  fill  in.  The  validity  and  reliability  of the  EQ-50  have  been  established  in 
various  diseases  and  populations and  is  currently ongoing  in  cancer trials  (37).  The  EQ-50  allows  the 
calculation of quality-adjusted-survival. 
The choice of these two instruments was based on the following  : 

- a  disease  specific  instrument  to  provide  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  principal  QoL 
dimensions  identified  as  relevant  by  cancer  patients  (physical  functioning,  emotional  functioning, 
cognitive  functioning,  role  functioning,  social  functioning,  global  QoL,  impact  of symptoms  and  of 
toxicities).  The  QLQ-C30  is  one  of the  standard  instruments  used  in  oncology for the evaluation  of 
new chemotherapies. 

-

a  generic  instrument  was  chosen  to  provide  a  global  measure  of health  outcome.  In  addition,  the 
EQ-50  is  becoming  one  of  the  preferred  instruments  in  large  multicentric  trials  because  of  its 
simplicity.

Assessments : 

Both  instruments will be completed  : 

prior to randomisation  (within 8 days) 
during  chemotherapy  administration  :  every  8  weeks  (+/- 1  week),  at  the  same  time  as  tumor 
assessment. Questionnaires should be filled  at the center, prior to chemotherapy administration. 
during follow-up  period  : every 8 weeks(+/- 1 week) until the documentation of the progression for 
the  patients  who  have  ended  treatment  but  not yet  progressed  and  every three  months  from  the 
documentation of the progression until death. 

Questionnaires  should  be  filled  in  at  the  center,  at  the  same  time  as  tumor  assessment,  prior  to 
informing  the  patient  about the  disease  evolution  and  before  next  infusion.  It  is  mandatory that  a  key 
person  (e.g.  research  nurse) at each center be responsible for questionnaire data collection,  in  order to 
optimize the compliance of the patient and to ensure the completeness of the data. 

8. 

ADVERSE EVENTS 

8.1. 

DEFINITIONS 

An  adverse  event  is  any  symptom,  sign,  illness  or  experience  which  develops  or worsens  in  severity 
during the course of the  study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should  be regarded  as  adverse  events. 
Abnormal  results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality : 

- results in study withdrawal 
- is associated with a serious adverse event 
- is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
- is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance 

Worsening  of the  disease  under  study will  normally  be  measured  by  efficacy parameters,  and  should 
only be recorded as an AE if the outcome is  serious or if specified  in  the protocol. 
Adverse  events  are  classified  as  either serious  or  non-serious.  A  serious  adverse  event  is  any  event 
that is: 

-fatal 
- life-threatening 
- requires or prolongs hospitalisation 
- results in  persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
- a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
- an  important medical event. 

Important medical  events  are those which  may not be immediately life-threatening,  but may jeopardize 
patients,  and  may  require  intervention  to  prevent  one  of  the  other  serious  outcomes  listed  above. 
Examples  of  such  events  are  intensive  treatment  in  an  emergency  room  or  at  home  for  allergic 
bronchospasm;  blood  dyscrasias  or  convulsions  that  do  not  result  in  hospitalization;  development  of 
drug dependency. Cancer and drug overdosage or abuse will normally be considered by this criterion. 

All  adverse events which  do  not meet any of the  criteria for serious should  be  regarded  as  non-serious 
adverse events. 

All  serious  adverse  events  occuring  from  the  randomisation  until  30  days  following  the  last 
infusion  of  chemotherapy  must  be  reported  according  to  the  procedure  described  below.  Any 
late  SAE  (occuring  after  this  30  day  period)  possibly  or  probably  related  to  the  study 
chemotherapy should follow the same reporting  procedure.

8.2. 

RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS 

At each  contact with  the  patient,  the  investigator must seek  information  on  adverse  events  by  specific 
questioning and,  as  appropriate,  by examination.  Information  on  all  adverse events should be recorded 
promptly.  For serious adverse events,  the Serious Adverse  Event  Form  must be  completed.  All  clearly 
related  signs,  symptoms  and  abnormal  diagnostic  procedures  should  be  grouped  together  and 
recorded  as  a  single  diagnosis  in  the  CRFs.  The  component  parts  of the  diagnosis  may be  listed  for 
verification. 

All  adverse  events  occurring  during  the  study  period  must  be  recorded.  The  clinical  course  of  each 
event  should  be  followed  until  resolution,  stabilisation  or  until  it  has  been  determined  that  study 
treatment or participation  is  not the cause.  Serious adverse events which  are  still ongoing at the  end  of 
the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome. 

Any  serious  adverse  event  which  occurs  after  the  study  period  and  is  considered  to  be  possibly  or 
probably related to study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported  immediately. 

8.3. 

REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 

All  serious  adverse  events  during  the  study  period,  whether  or  not  considered  to  be  related  to  study 
treatment must be  reported  to  RPR within  24  hours or,  at the latest,  on  the following  working  day.  The 
report should be made by telephone or fax to one of the following  individuals (in  order of priority) : 

1 . SAE contact identified on  pages 3 and 4

us 

At  the  time  of the  initial  report,  the  following  information  should  be  provided  if possible:  study,  center 
and  patient number;  the  study phase during which  the  event occurred;  a description  of the  event,  date 
of onset and  current status;  the  start date of treatment  ; whether treatment has been  discontinued;  the 
reason  why the  event  is  classified  as  serious;  the  investigator's  current assessment of the  association 
between the event and study treatment. 

Significant new information on  ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to  RPR. 

8.4. 

PATIENT REMOVAL FROM STUDY THERAPY DUE TO ADVERSE EVENTS 

Any  patient  who  experiences  an  adverse  event  may  be  withdrawn  at  any  time  from  the  study  at  the 
discretion of the investigator. 

If the  adverse  event  may relate  to  overdose  of study treatment,  the  Investigator's  Brochure should  be 
consulted for details of any specific actions to be taken. 

If  a  patient  is  withdrawn  wholly  or  in  part  because  of  an  adverse  event,  the  appropriate  withdrawals 
section  of the  CRFs  should  be  fully completed  in  addition  to  the  Adverse  Event  module.  The  monitor 
should be informed without delay of all  patients who are withdrawn for this reason.

DATAANALYSIS 

9.1. 

SAMPLE SIZE 

•  Phase II 

(38).  With  this  rationale,  the  test  arm  with  the  highest observed  CR  rate  will  be  identified  as  the 
efficacious test arm.  The arm with  highest CR rate,  however, will  not in  itself determine the optimal test 
arm  but rather provide one input into an  overall benefit-risk analysis of the efficacy and safety of the test 
arms. The  relevance of efficacy in  this benefit-risk analysis will  be proportional  to the  observed  difference in 
CR  rates  after assessing the  influence  of any imbalances  between  the  test  arms  with  respect to  prognostic 
factors  (liver  and/or  peritoneal  metastases  and  prior  gastrectomy).  The  safety  of the  treatments  will  be 
assessed  by analyzing  the frequency and  type  of serious adverse events  and  the  overall  management 
of adverse events, e.g., dose reductions/delays and supportive measures. 

An  Independent Data Monitoring Committee will be responsible for selecting  1 of the 2 test regimens.

•  Phase Ill Test of Superiority 

The primary goal  of the Phase Ill  part of the  study is  to  detect a statistically significant increase in  TTP 
for the selected test arm  relative to the control arm. 

•  Phase Ill Test of Non-Inferiority 

In  the  event that the  test arm  prolongs TTP  relative  to  the  control,  but the  difference  is  not statistically 
significant,  then  attention  will  be  focused  on  whether TTP  in  the  test arm  is  statistically non-inferior to 
TTP  in  the CDDP + 5-FU  arm, a regimen with  a proven activity as  described by Kim  in  Cancer in  1993. 
If non-inferiority can  be  established  for  TTP,  then  substantial  evidence  of clinical  benefit may warrant 
the  use  of the  test  regimen.  Clinical  benefit  will  be  assessed  with  the  endpoint  time  to  worsening  of 
performance status. 
A test of non-inferiority will  be  combined with  the test of superiority in  the Phase  Ill  analysis based on  a 
closed  testing  procedure  (40).  The  null  hypothesis for the  non-inferiority test  is  that the  test arm  has  a 
25%  higher  event  rate  relative  to  the  control  arm  (41 ).  This  is  equivalent  to  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.80 
(control I test). The treatment hazard ratio will  be estimated from a Cox proportional hazards model with 
an  indicator for  the  control  arm.  The  null  hypothesis will  be  rejected  if the  lower  bound  of the  2-sided 
95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio from this model exceeds 0.80. 

STRATIFICATION I RANDOMISATION BALANCE 

The randomization will  be balanced on the following factors with a biased coin minimization method (42, 
43).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

•  Efficacy analysis 

Primary efficacy analyses 
The  Phase  Ill  primary analysis  will  be  a comparison  of TTP  in  the full  analysis  population.  To  test the 
superiority of the test arm  relative to  the  control  arm,  an  unadjusted  logrank test will  be  used.  The test 
of non-inferiority will  be  based  on  the  maximum  partial  likelihood  estimate  of the  treatment log  hazard 
ratio (control I test) from  a Cox's proportional hazards model with an  indicator for the control arm. 
If the  score statistic for testing  that the  hazard  ratio  is  0.8  is  positive and  statistically significant at  a 1-
sided 2,5% significance level, then the test arm will be declared to be non-inferior to the control.

Secondary efficacy analyses 
Survival  will  be  compared  with  the  logrank test  and  time  to  treatment failure will  be  compared with  the 
Wilcoxon  test  in  the  full  analysis  and  per  protocol  populations.  Cox  model  regression  will  be  used  to 
explore the influence of baseline factors on  all censored efficacy data 
Comparison of tumor response rates between  treatment groups will  be performed using a l  test in  the 
full  analysis  and  per  protocol  populations.  Logistic  regression  modeling  will  be  used  to  explore  the 
influence  of baseline  factors.  An  exact  confidence  interval  will  be  calculated  for  the  overall  response 
and complete response rates for each treatment arm. 

•  Safety analysis 

Safety analyses will be by treatment received and will  include all patients who received study therapy. 

The  safety  profile  of the  docetaxel  regimen  in  the  Phase  Ill  efficacy analysis  will  be  compared  to  the 
control arm  using the NCIC-CTG classification. 

Grade 3-4 adverse events with  an  overall  incidence rate  of 1 0%  or more in  either treatment arm will  be 
identified,  and  the  difference  in  the  frequency  of  these  events  between  the  treatment  arms  will  be 
compared  using a 2-sided  Fisher's exact test.  The Holm significance level  ranking  (step-down) method 
will  be  used  to  adjust  the  nominal  significance  level  of  each  comparison  for  an  overall  2-sided  5% 
significance level (44). 
Treatment  discontinuation  due  to  an  adverse  event and  toxic  deaths will  be  compared  using  Fisher's 
exact test. 

9.2.1.  Definition of populations 

Full  analysis  population  is  defined  as  the  population  of all  treated  patients  analyzed  in  the  arm  they 
were assigned by randomisation. 

Per protocol population  :consists  of eligible  patients  treated  and  evaluable  for  response without major 
deviation during the study. Major protocol violations during study include the omission of one the drug of 
the  study  treatment  for  any  other  reason  than  toxicity,  and  treatment  in  another  arm  than  the  one 
assigned by randomization. 

9.2.2.  Statistical methods 

Summary tables will  be provided. 

A 2-sided 5% significance level will  be applied to all tests. 
Survival  data  will  be  described  using  Kaplan-Meier  curves  and  life  tables.  Non-parametric  confidence 
intervals will  be  calculated  for the  median  survival  time  and  for  differences  in  median  survival  (45,46). 
Survival  between  groups will  be  compared  with  stratified  linear rank tests  (logrank  and  Wilcoxon) and 
Cox's  proportional  hazards  model.  Graphical  methods will  be  used  to  assess  proportional  hazards.  In 
the  event  of non-proportional  hazards,  the  statistical  significance  of the  maximum  survival  difference 
between groups will be assessed with  a 2-sided generalized Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (47). 
x2  tests will  be  used to compare groups on  categorical variables unless the expected cell frequency is  < 
5,  in  which  case  Fisher's  exact test will  be  used.  Logistic  or  proportional  odds  models will  be  used  to 
adjust for prognostic factors.  Exact confidence intervals will be calculated for binary event rates.

chemotherapy for advanced disease.

Analysis  of variance or covariance will  be  used  to  compare treatment groups on  continuous variables if 
they are  approximately normally distributed  (with  or without transformation).  If the  normality of the data 
cannot  be  established,  then  a  stratified  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  test  will  be  used  (48),  and  confidence 
intervals will  be  calculated  using a minimum dispersion method (49).  The Shapiro-Wilk test will  be  used 
to test for normality. 

Repeated  measures  data  will  be  analyzed  with  generalized  estimating  equation  methods  (50,  51).  A 
mixed model will be fit with treatment as a fixed  effect, time as a repeated factor and  a random effect of 
patient within treatment group. An  identity link function  will  be used to model the  marginal distribution of 
continuous data as a linear function of covariates,  and  a Poisson  distribution will  be assumed for which 
the  variance  function  is  equal  to  the  mean.  The  logit  link  function  will  be  used  to  model  the  marginal 
distribution  for  binary data  with  the  variance  function  defined  in  terms  of the  mean,  p,  as  p(1  - p).  To 
optimize the efficiency of the estimation, the observed  correlation  structure of the data will  be evaluated 
and  the  most  appropriate  working  correlation  structure  will  be  selected  for  the  model  estimation. 
Interactions  between  treatment and  prognostic factors will  be  assessed  and  terms  not significant  at  a 
5%  level will  be dropped from  the final  model. 

9.2.3.  Treatment group comparability 

Comparability At Baseline 

Comparability at baseline will be studied.  It will  include: 

patient characteristics at baseline:  Karnofsky performance status, age, weight loss, disease-related 
symptoms, laboratory values. 
tumor  characteristics  at  inclusion  :  metastatic  site  of  disease  (proximal  defined  as  esogastric 
junction  vs.  antrum,  body  and  fundus),  liver  involvement,  primary tumor  resection,  histologic type 
(diffuse  v.s.  intestinal),  lesion  type  (measurable  vs.  evaluable),  number  of organs  involved,  time 
from first diagnosis to randomisation, time from first metastasis to randomisation. 
prior therapy : surgery and prior chemotherapy. 

No formal  statistical comparison is  planned to compare treatment groups.  However, in case of evidence 
of  heterogeneity,  statistical  tests  will  be  performed  to  provide  the  significance  level  of the  observed 
difference. 

Comparability During The Study 

Comparability during study will  be assessed on the following parameters: 

Reason for treatment discontinuation 
On-study protocol deviations 
Further chemotherapy 
Extent of exposure. 

9.2.4.  Phase Ill  Interim Analysis 

One  interim  analysis during the  Phase  Ill  part of the trial  is  planned when  162 events or approximately 
50%  of the  total  expected  events to  be  included  in  the final  analysis will  have occurred.  It  is  estimated 
that  this  number of events  will  accumulate  after 272  patients  have  been  randomized  in  the  Phase  Ill 
and followed for a minimum of 2 months. 

An  O'Brien-Fleming  stopping  boundary will  be  used  for  the  interim  analysis  of survival.  Given  50%  of 
the  total  expected  deaths  at  the  time  of the  interim  analysis,  the  nominal  significance  levels  for  the 
interim and final  analyses of survival will  be 0.36% and 4.87%, respectively (52,53,54).

Open  label,  randomized  multicentre phase  IIIII I study of docetaxel in  combination with  cisplatin (COOP)  or docetaxel in  combination  with  5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU) and COOP compared to the combination of COOP and 5-FU  in  patients with  metastatic or locally recurrent gastric cancer previously untreated with 
chemotherapy for advanced disease. 

To support a possible early registration based on  tumor response at the time of the interim analysis, the 
overall  response  rate  will  be compared  between  the test and  control  arm.  The  null  hypothesis of equal 
response  rates will  be tested  at a 2-sided 5%  significance level. Allowing for a  10% non-evaluable rate, 
approximately 216  patients  (2  x  108 I  arm) will  be  included  in  the  analysis  of response,  as  evaluable 
and  followed  for a minimum  of 3 months.  This will  provide 97%  power to detect a difference of 25%  in 
tumor response  rates with  a control  rate  of 30% vs.  55%  for the test arm.  Subsequent analyses will  not 
test  this  null  hypothesis  again  but  will  be  used  to  obtain  a  more  precise  estimate  of the  difference  in 
response rates.

9.2.5.  Clinical benefit evaluation 

9. 2. 5. 1.  Clinical benefit parameters 

Clinical benefit parameters will  be as follows: 

Time to worsening I improvement of Karnofsky performance status 
Worsening  is  defined  as  a  decrease  at  one  time  of  at  least  1  Karnofsky  category  compared  to 
baseline,  and  improvement is  defined as  an  increase of at least 1 Karnofsky category compared to 
baseline. 

Time to worsening I improvement of weight loss 
Worsening  is  defined  as  a  decrease  at  one  time  of  at  least  5%  compared  to  baseline,  and 
improvement is defined as a increase at one time of at least 5%  compared to baseline. 

Time to worsening I improvement of appetite 
Due  to  the  fact  that  the  NCIC  grade for  anorexia  contains  only two  grades  and  was  felt  to  be  too 
restrictive, the following scale derived from  the work of Osoba (55) will be  used: 

Appetite grading 

During the past week, my appetite has been  : 
1. Very poor 

12. Poor 

I 3.  Fair 

14. Good 

15.  Excellent 

Pain-free survival 
Defined  only for  patients with  NCIC grade  0  pain  at baseline as  the  interval  from  randomisation  to 
the appearance at one time of grade 1 or greater pain. 

9. 2. 5. 2.  Clinical benefit analyses 

Kaplan-Meier  analyses  and  logrank  tests  will  be  performed  on  the  clinical  benefit  parameters.  Tables 
analysing the analgesic consumption in  the two arms will  be provided. 

Karnofsky  performance  scores  will  be  collected  at  baseline  and  each  cycle.  Two  analyses  will  be 
performed,  one with  the  scores  collapsed  into 2  categories  at each  cycle,  100%  vs  <  100%,  and  one 
with  the scores collapsed  into 3 categories,  100%  vs  70-90%  vs  < 70%.  In  each  case,  the data will  be 
analyzed  using  generalized  estimating  equation  methods  to  model  whether  the  proportion  of patients 
with  a 1 00% scores change over time between the treatment groups.

RHONE-POULENC RORER PROPOSAL 

86 of 109 

1/3 

INFORMATION SHEET 
Study number : RP 56976 - V - 325 
We invite you  to take part in  a research  study of a  new drug,  docetaxel,  supplied  by a company called 
Rh6ne-Poulenc Rorer Recherche-Deweloppement.  It was shown in  experimental  laboratory tests and  in 
early studies  in  humans that docetaxel  may help to  control  your disease.  It  is  not  known,  however,  if it 
will  work  better when  given  together with  other drugs  called  cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil  which  are  also 
effective in  your disease. The aim of the study is to see how effective docetaxel is  in  your disease when 
combined  either  with  cisplatin  more  or  less  5-fluorouracil.  You  might  be  treated  either with  docetaxel 
and cisplatin or with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU. 
Neither you  or your  physician  have  a  choice  as  to  which  treatment you  receive.  You  will  be  randomly 
assigned to  1 of the 2 treatments. 
In  order  to  collect  also  your  opinion  about  the  treatment,  you  will  be  asked  to  fill  in  a  quality  of life 
questionnaire every 8 weeks. 
This  study  has  been  declared  to  the  Health  Authorities  and  has  been  approved  by  the  Ethics 
Committee. 

MODALITIES OF THE TREATMENT 

The drugs will  be given to  you  in  hospital. They will  be administered  to you  through  a drip  into a vein  in 
your arm  (an  infusion). You  will  receive one of the 2 regimens: 
-

docetaxel  administered  as  a  1  hour  infusion  followed  by  cisplatin  administered  as  a  1  to  3-hour 
infusion 
or docetaxel  administered  as  a  1 hour infusion  followed  by cisplatin  administered  as  a  1 to  3-hour 
infusion followed by 5-FU administered as a continuous 24 hour infusion for 5 consecutive days. 

-

This  treatment will  be  performed  every 3 weeks for docetaxel  combined  with  cisplatin  more or less  5-
FU. 

You  will  receive the  treatment unless you  do not want to  participate anymore in  the study,  or it is  not in 
your best interest or you  have experienced unacceptable toxicity. 

A treatment with oral corticosteroids will be given before each infusion. Corticosteroid premedication will 
be started the day before docetaxel  infusion and  given for 3 days in  order to try to improve certain side(cid:173)
effects with  docetaxel e.g. allergy reactions, extremities and/or face swelling with or without fluid around 
lung or abdomen. 

MEDICAL SUPERVISION 

Before  receiving  the  drug,  you  will  have  a  number of tests  to  ascertain  if you  can  enter the  study  : a 
blood examination,  a physical examination and  imaging procedures to check the spread of your disease 
will  be performed.  Most of these tests will  be repeated  before each infusion of the drug. 

After  receiving  the  drug,  you  will  have  your  blood  checked  at  least weekly.  Those  regular  blood  tests 
and  other examinations  will  be  performed  to  check that the  drug  is  not adversely affecting  your  bone

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS 
The  infusion  itself may cause  temporary  irritation  and  bruises  at  the  site  of infusion  using  a peripheral 
vein.  Among  known  side  effects  of  docetaxel  are  short  lasting  mild  to  moderate  nausea  and/or 
vomiting,  weight  gain  and  fluid  retention,  including  swelling  of  the  limbs  and/or  face  with  or  without 
effusions  around  lung  or  abdomen,  mouth  irritation  which  may  cause  you  some  problems  for  food 
intake,  diarrhea,  tiredness,  reversible  numbness and  tingling  in  hands or feet,  hair loss,  skin  reactions, 
dystrophic  nail  changes  with  discoloration  and/or  pain  and/or  brittleness,  allergy which  needs  a  close 
monitoring during  infusion, and  temporary changes  in  blood  tests which  may render you  more prone to 
infection and  bruising. 
Among  the  side  effects  encountered  with  5-fluorouracil  treatment  ;  nausea,  vomiting,  mucositis, 
diarrhea,  skin  reactions,  hair loss,  bone  marrow damage with  falls  in  leucocyte and  platelet counts,  are 
observed.  Moreover, cardiac toxicity has been reported with  5-Fiuorouracil. 
Among the  side-effects due to  cisplatin,  nausea,  vomiting,  hearing loss,  reversible numbness,  tingling 
in  hands or feet and  renal  toxicity are observed. 
In  case  of fever  or  bruising,  you  must  contact  doctors  in  the  department.  All  these  side  effects  were 
experienced  by patients during  previous studies  but you  may also experience other ones which  are not 
predictable at the moment. 
These  side  effects  may be  a  minor  inconvenience  or could  be  severe,  but  the  physician  in  charge  of 
you will watch you  closely if any occurs. 
These side effects can occur even if the treatment is effective in your disease. 
The  effect  of  the  drugs  will  be  regularly  assessed.  If  no  activity  is  observed,  the  treatment  will  be 
stopped. 
Your  doctor  can  remove  you  from  the  study  if  it  is  harmful  to  you,  if  you  fail  to  follow  treatment 
instructions, if it is discovered that you  do not meet requirements of the trial or if the study is cancelled. 
You  should  not take  part  in  this  study if you  think you  could  be  pregnant or  if there  is  a possibility you 
could  become  pregnant during  the  study.  Your doctor will  therefore check  that you  are  using  a reliable 
method of contraception before starting study drug treatment. 

CONFIDENTIALITY 
If you  participate,  your  records  will  need  to  be  made  available  to  the  sponsor  Rhone-Poulenc  Rorer 
Recherche-Developpement,  Health  Authorities,  relevant  regulatory  Agencies  or  may  be  published  for 
scientific purposes but your identity will remain confidential. 

YOUR RIGHTS 
You  will  be  informed of any significant new findings about the drugs which  may lead you  to change your 
willingness to participate. 
The  decision  to  take  part  in  this  study  must  be  made  by  you  and  you  should  not  feel  under  any 
pressure.  If you  decide to take part but later change your mind, you are free to do so and do not have to 
give  any reason.  The  level  of care  you  receive from  your doctor will  not be  affected.  If you  decide you 
no longer agree to take  part,  please tell  your doctor who will  be  able to evaluate your medical  condition 
and then remove you  from  the study and  continue medical care. 
In  case of harm  caused  to  you  by the study drugs,  RhOne-Poulenc  Rorer has  contracted  an  insurance 
policy which covers the liability of your doctor during the study.

INFORMATION SHEET 
Study number : RP 56976 - V - 325 
We invite you  to  take part in  a research  study of a new drug,  docetaxel, supplied  by a company called 
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Recherche-Developpement.  It was shown  in  experimental laboratory tests and  in 
early studies  in  humans that docetaxel  may help to  control  your disease.  It is  not known,  however,  if it 
will  work  better when  given  together with  other drugs  called  cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil which  are also 
effective in your disease. The aim  of the study is  to see how effective docetaxel  is  in your disease when 
combined  either with  cisplatin  and/or 5-fluorouracil  compared  to  the efficacy of cisplatin  combined  with 
5-FU (which is also an  effective treatment in your disease). You  might be treated either with a docetaxel 
plus cisplatin and  5-FU regimen, or a cisplatin and 5-FU  regimen. 
Neither you  or your  physician  have  a  choice  as  to  which  treatment you  receive.  You  will  be  randomly 
assigned to  1 of the 2 treatments. 
In  order  to  collect  also  your  opinion  about  the  treatment,  you  will  be  asked  to  fill  in  a  quality  of life 
questionnaire every 8 weeks. 
This  study  has  been  declared  to  the  Health  Authorities  and  has  been  approved  by  the  Ethics 
Committee. 
MODALITIES OF THE TREATMENT 
The  drugs will  be  given  to  you  in  hospital.  They will  be  administered to you  through a drip into a vein  in 
your arm (an infusion). You will receive one of the 2 regimens  : 
- docetaxel  administered  as  a  1  hour  infusion  followed  by  cisplatin  administered  as  a  1 to  3  hour 

-

infusion followed by 5-FU administered as a continuous 24 hour infusion for 5 consecutive days. 
cisplatin  administered  as  a  1 to  3-hour infusion  given  on  day  1 followed  by 5-FU  administered  as  a 
continuous 24 hour infusion for 5 consecutive days. 

This treatment will be performed every 3 weeks for docetaxel combined with cisplatin and  5-FU or every 
4 weeks for cisplatin combined with 5-FU. 
You  will  receive the treatment unless you  do  not want to participate anymore  in  the study,  or it is  not in 
your best interest or you  have experienced unacceptable toxicity. 
A  treatment  (with  oral  corticosteroids)  will  be  given  if  you  receive  docetaxel  before  each  infusion. 
Corticosteroid  premedication  will  be  started  the  day before  docetaxel  infusion  and  given  for 3 days  in 
order to try to  improve certain  side-effects with  docetaxel e.g.  allergy reactions,  extremities and/or face 
swelling with or without fluid around lung or abdomen. 

MEDICAL SUPERVISION 
Before  receiving  the  drug,  you  will  have  a  number of tests  to  ascertain  if you  can  enter the  study  : a 
blood examination, a physical examination and  imaging procedures to check the spread of your disease 
will  be performed.  Most of these tests will be repeated before each  infusion of the drug. 
After  receiving  the  drug,  you  will  have  your  blood  checked  at  least weekly.  Those  regular  blood  tests 
and  other examinations will  be  performed  to  check  that  the  drug  is  not  adversely affecting  your  bone 
marrow,  kidneys  and  liver.  If  needed,  supportive  treatment  will  also  be  given.  Thereafter you  will  be 
followed  (physical  examination  and  possible  imaging  procedures)  by  your  physician  at  the  end  of the 
study (one month after the last infusion) and  every eight weeks to see the evolution of your illness.

Implementation of the Taxotere with new storage conditions 

Implementation  of  the  Taxotere  with  new  storage  conditions  for  clinical  trials  is  following  the 
implementation  on  the  Market.  First  Market  supplied  is  the  European  Community*,  plus  Norway  and 
Switzerland. 

In  these  first  countries,  for  Clinical  trials,  Taxotere  stored  between  +2°C  to  +8°C  will  be  replaced  by 
Taxotere stored  between  +2°C to+ 25 °C.  Locally,  Taxotere stored  between +2°C to  +8°C will  be used 
until inventories are depleted. 

Supplies 
progressively, depending on  Local Approval, and  Market Launch. 

for  Clinical  trials  of  the  Taxotere  with  new  storage  conditions  will  be  implemented 

inventories  of Taxotere stored  between  +2°C  to  +8°C  and  inventories of Taxotere 
For a short  period, 
stored  between  +2°C  to  + 25 oc  will  be  available at the  same  investigational  sites.  We suggest not  to 
mix premix solution  of Taxotere stored  between  +2°C to  +8°C,  and  premix solution  of Taxotere stored 
between  +2°C to  +25°C.  In  case it happens, the  period for use of the premix and the infusion bags will 
be  the  shortest,  corresponding  to  the  instructions  for  use  of  Taxotere  stored  between  +2°C  to  +8°C.

SOLUTION FOR INFUSION FORTAXOTERE® 

Storage Conditions  + 2° C and +8 oc 

1 . Drug substance 

International non-proprietary name : docetaxel 

- Code name : RP56976 

2.  Formulations 

TAXOTERE®  concentrate  for  solution  for 
infusion  is  a  clear  viscous,  yellow  to  brown-yellow  solution 
containing 40 mg/ml docetaxel  (anhydrous) in  polysorbate 80.  The Solvent for TAXOTERE® is a 13% w/w 
solution of ethanol in water for injection. 

3.  Presentation 

3.1 

TAXOTERE® 80 mg vial: 

•  The TAXOTERE® 80 mg vial  is a 15 ml  clear glass vial with a red  flip-off cap. 
•  The labeled dosage strength is  80 mg docetaxel per vial. 
•  The labeled volume of one vial  is 2 ml  of a 40 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in  polysorbate 80. 
•  Practically,  TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vial  contains  2.36  ml  of the  40  mg/ml  solution  of docetaxel 
equivalent to 94.4 mg docetaxel. This volume has been established and validated during the 
development of Taxotere® to  compensate  for  liquid  loss  during  preparation  of the  premix 
(see  section  4)  due to foaming,  adhesion  to  the walls  of the vial  and  "dead-volumes". This 
overfill  ensures  that  there  is  a  minimal  extractable  premix  volume  of  8  ml  containing  10 
mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labeled amount of 80 mg per vial. 

3.2 

Solvent for Taxotere® 80 mg vial: 

•  The Solvent for TAXOTERE  ® 80  mg  vial  is  a 15 ml  clear glass vial with a transparent colorless flip-off 

cap. 

•  The Solvent forT AXOTERE® composition is a 13% w/w solution of ethanol in water for injection 
•  The theoretical volume of one vial  is 6 ml of Solvent for TAXOTERE®. 
•  Practically, a solvent for TAXOTERE® 80 mg vial contains 7.33 ml ± 5% of Solvent. This volume 
has  been  established  and validated  based  on  the practical  content of the TAXOTERE®  80  mg 
vial and ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. 

STORAGE CONDITIONS  : 
In  a refrigerator,  protected from  bright light. 

4.  Preparation of the premix solution under aseptic conditions 

4.1. 

4.2. 

Remove  the  required  number of TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vials  and  solvent for TAXOTERE® vials from 
the refrigerator and allow to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. 
For  each  TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vial,  using  a  syringe  fitted  with  a  needle,  withdraw  THE  ENTIRE 
CONTENTS  of  the  corresponding  Solvent  for  TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vial  (7.33  ml  ±  5%  for 
TAXOTERE® 80mg vial} and  inject it into the corresponding TAXOTERE® 80 mg vial. 
The  addition  of  THE  ENTIRE  CONTENTS  of  one  Solvent  for  TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vial  to  one 
TAXOTERE® 80 mg vial ensures a minimal extractable volume of the premix solution of 8 mi.

4.3. 

Remove the syringe and needle and shake the mixture manually for 15 seconds. 

4.4. 

Allow  the  premix  vial  to  stand  for  5  minutes  at  room  temperature  and  then  check  that  the 
solution  is  homogenous  and  clear.  (Foaming  is  normal  even  after  5  minutes  due  to  the 
presence of polysorbate 80 in the formulation) 
The  premix  solution  contains  10  mg/ml  docetaxel  and  should  be  used  immediately  to 
prepare the infusion solution. 

5.  Preparation of the infusion solution under aseptic conditions 

5.1. 

More than  one premix vial  may be necessary to  obtain  the required  dose for the patient.  Based 
on  the  required  dose  for  the  patient  expressed  in  mg,  use  graduated  syringes  fitted  with  a 
needle  to  withdraw the  corresponding  premix volume  containing  10  mg/ml  docetaxel  from  the 
appropriate number of premix vials.  For example,  a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would  require 14 
ml  premix solution. 

5.2. 

Inject  the  required  premix  volume  into  a  250  ml  infusion  bag  or  bottle  containing  either  5% 
glucose solution or 0.9% sodium chloride solution. 

If  a  dose  greater  than  200  mg  of  docetaxel  is  required,  use  a  larger  volume  of  the  infusion 

vehicle so that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 

5.3. 

Mix infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 

The  TAXOTERE®  infusion  solution  should  be  administered  intravenously  within  the  four  hours 
including a one hour infusion under room temperature and  normal lighting conditions. 

6.  Visual inspection 

As  with  all  parenteral  products,  TAXOTERE®  should  be  inspected  visually  for  particulate  matter  or 
discoloration  prior  to  administration  whenever the  solution  and  container permit.  If TAXOTERE®  premix 
solution  or  infusion  solution  is  not  clear  or  appears  to  have  precipitation,  the  solution  should  be

7.  Recommendations for the safe handling 

TAXOTERE® is an  antineoplastic agent and, as with  other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be 
exercised when  handling it and  preparing TAXOTERE® solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. 
If TAXOTERE® concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with  skin, wash 
immediately and  thoroughly with  soap and water.  If TAXOTERE® concentrate,  premix solution  or infusion 
solution  should  come  into  contact  with  mucous  membranes,  wash  immediately  and  thoroughly  with 
water.

Supplies for Clinical trials of the Taxotere with new storage conditions will be implemented 

progressively, depending on Local Approval and Market Launch 

Storage Conditions  + 2° C and +25 oc 

1 . Drug Substance 

International non-proprietary name : docetaxel 

-
- Code name : RP56976 

2.  Formulations 

TAXOTERE®  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  a  clear  viscous,  yellow  to  brown-yellow  solution 
containing 40 mg/ml docetaxel (anhydrous) in  polysorbate 80. The Solvent for TAXOTERE® is a 13% w/w 
solution of ethanol  in water for injection. 

3.  Presentation 

3.1 

TAXOTERE® 80 mg  vial: 

•  The TAXOTERE® 80 mg vial  is  a 15 ml clear glass vial with a red flip-off cap. 
•  The labeled dosage strength is 80 mg docetaxel per vial. 
•  The labeled volume of one vial  is 2 ml  of a 40  mg/ml solution of docetaxel in  polysorbate 80. 
•  Practically,  TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vial  contains  2.36  ml  of the  40  mg/ml  solution  of docetaxel 
equivalent to 94.4 mg docetaxel. This volume has been established and validated during the 
development  of Taxotere®  to  compensate  for  liquid  loss  during  preparation  of the  premix 
(see  section  4)  due to foaming,  adhesion  to the walls of the vial  and  "dead-volumes". This 
overfill  ensures  that  there  is  a  minimal  extractable  premix  volume  of  8  ml  containing  10 
mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labeled amount of 80 mg per vial. 

3.2 

solvent for Taxotere® 80  mg vial: 

•  The Solvent for TAXOTERE ® 80 mg vial  is a 15 ml  clear glass vial with a transparent colorless flip-off 

cap. 

•  The Solvent for TAXOTERE® composition is a 13% w/w solution of ethanol in water for injection 
•  The theoretical volume of one vial  is  6 ml  of Solvent for TAXOTERE®. 
•  Practically, a solvent for TAXOTERE® 80  mg vial contains 7.33 ml ± 5% of Solvent. This volume 
has  been  established  and validated  based on  the  practical content of the  TAXOTERE®  80  mg 
vial and ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. 

STORAGE CONDITIONS: 
Vials should be stored between +2°C and  +25°C and protected from  bright light.

chemotherapy for advanced disease.

4.  Preparation of the premix solution under aseptic conditions 

4.1. 

4.2. 

Remove the  required  number of TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vials  and  solvent for TAXOTERE® vials from 
the refrigerator and allow to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. 
For  each  TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vial,  using  a  syringe  fitted  with  a  needle,  withdraw  THE  ENTIRE 
CONTENTS  of  the  corresponding  Solvent  for  TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vial  (7.33  ml  ±  5%  for 
TAXOTERE® 80mg vial) and  inject it into the corresponding TAXOTERE® 80 mg vial. 
The  addition  of  THE  ENTIRE  CONTENTS  of  one  Solvent  for  TAXOTERE®  80  mg  vial  to  one 
TAXOTERE® 80 mg vial  ensures a minimal extractable volume of the premix solution of 8 mi. 

4.3. 

Remove the syringe and  needle and  shake the mixture manually for 15 seconds. 

4.4. 

Allow  the  premix  vial  to  stand  for  5  minutes  at  room  temperature  and  then  check  that  the 
solution  is  homogenous  and  clear.  (Foaming  is  normal  even  after  5  minutes  due  to  the 
presence of polysorbate 80 in  the formulation) 
The  premix  solution  contains  10  mg/ml  docetaxel  and  should  be  used  immediately  to 
prepare the infusion solution.However the  chemical  and  physical  stability of the  premix 
solution  has  been  demonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between +2°C and  +8°C 
or at room temperature. 

5.  Preparation of the infusion solution under aseptic conditions 

5.1. 

More than  one premix vial  may be  necessary to  obtain the required  dose for the patient.  Based 
on  the  required  dose  for  the  patient  expressed  in  mg,  use  graduated  syringes  fitted  with  a 
needle  to  withdraw the  corresponding  premix volume  containing  10  mg/ml  docetaxel from  the 
appropriate number of premix vials.  For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would  require  14 
ml  premix solution. 

5.2. 

Inject  the  required  premix  volume  into  a  250  ml  infusion  bag  or  bottle  containing  either  5% 
glucose solution or 0.9% sodium chloride solution. 

If  a  dose  greater  than  200  mg  of  docetaxel  is  required,  use  a  larger  volume  of the  infusion 

vehicle so that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 

5.3. 

Mix  infusion  bag  or bottle  manually using  a  rocking  motion.  The TAXOTERE  infusion  solution 
should  be  used  within  4  hours  and  should  be  aseptically  administered  as  a  1  hour  infusion 
under room  temperature and normal lighting conditions. 

The  TAXOTERE®  infusion  solution  should  be  administered  intravenously within  the  four  hours 
including a one hour infusion under room temperature and normal lighting conditions. 

6.  Visual  inspection 

As  with  all  parenteral  products,  TAXOTERE®  should  be  inspected  visually  for  particulate  matter  or 
discoloration  prior  to  administration  whenever  the  solution  and  container  permit.  If TAXOTERE®  premix 
solution  or  infusion  solution  is  not  clear  or  appears  to  have  precipitation,  the  solution  should  be 
discarded.
