Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9

Rationale for Amendment 9 (relative to global amendment 5)
The primary purpose of this amendment is to define the change in study procedures 
following a decision to unblind the study.  At the time of unblinding, this study will have 
met its primary objective of determining the improvement of overall survival (OS) by 
orteronel plus prednisone.  Therefore, the protocol has been modified to reflect changes in 
study procedures.  After unblinding, patients who are still active on the study and who 
received placebo will be offered the opportunity to crossover to active treatment with 
orteronel.  Those treatment-naïve patients will undergo procedures outlined in the Schedules
of Events #1 (Patients Crossing From Placebo to Orteronel After Unblinding).  Patients who
received active study drug and who elect to continue receiving orteronel will undergo study 
procedures as outlined in the Schedules of Events #2 (Patients Continuing to Receive 
Orteronel After Unblinding).  Portions of the study that are no longer relevant or no longer 
needed after unblinding (eg, short-term follow-up, collection of samples for measurement of 
circulating tumor cells [CTCs] and plasma orteonel concentrations, pharmacokinetic [PK] 
sampling, imaging studies, quality of life questionnaires, etc) have been removed from the 
Schedules of Events with the protocol text amended to reflect that this data is no longer 
collected.  
Specific safety language has been updated to be consistent with current safety information 
and standard language used in the sponsor's protocols.
Instructions have been added to ensure that patients who received placebo met certain 
eligibility criteria to crossover to active treatment with orteronel.
Details on study conduct have been updated to clarify acceptable methods of contraception 
and provide a clear definition of abstinence from heterosexual intercourse.  Guidance on 
contraception or abstention from heterosexual intercourse has been updated.  In addition, 
allowable reasons for withdrawal of patients from the study have been updated.
Information on supply, labeling, and storage of study drug has been updated.  
The method for recording, reporting, and monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) has been updated to be consistent with current procedures.

Purposes for Amendment 9
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Procedures

 Update the Study Flow Diagram to reflect the change in study procedures after 

unblinding

 Create 2 Schedules of Events at the time of unblinding:  1 for patients crossing over 

from placebo to orteronel and 1 for patients continuing to receive orteronel

 Remove the following study procedures for patients in the unblinded study, because 

sufficient data will have been collected before study unblinding, and limited 
inference can be made following crossover of all patients to active study drug:
o PK sampling

unblinding

 Update language on utility measurement, stating that this data will be continually 

collected until the patient discontinues study drug

 Add language indicating that the short-term follow-up portion of the study will no 

longer apply to patients at the time of unblinding

Eligibility

 Add inclusion criteria for patients crossing over from placebo to orteronel treatment
 Clarify that disease progression is not required for patients crossing over from 

placebo to orteronel treatment

PROTOCOL SUMMARY

Study Title:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter Trial Comparing Orteronel 
(TAK-700) Plus Prednisone With Placebo Plus Prednisone in Patients With Metastatic Castration-
Resistant Prostate Cancer That Has Progressed During or Following Docetaxel-based Therapy
Number of Patients:  Approximately 1,083 patients will be randomized into this study from 
approximately 400 study centers worldwide.

Study Objectives:
Primary Objective:

 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone improves overall survival (OS)

Key Secondary Objectives:  

 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone improves radiographic progression-free survival 

 To determine if orteronel plus prednisone improves 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 

(rPFS)

response rate at 12 weeks

 To evaluate if orteronel plus prednisone improves pain response at 12 weeks

Exploratory Objectives:

 To assess  tumor specimens for candidate biomarkers predictive of orteronel antitumor 

activity including, but not limited to, the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene

 To evaluate polymorphisms in the CYP17 gene and other germline genes implicated in the 

safety or efficacy of orteronel

 To assess the functioning and symptom QOL subscales of the European Organization for 

Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Module 30 (EORTC 
QLQ-C30)

 To evaluate medical resource utilization (MRU) and calculate utility values using a 

preference-based patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument (European Quality of Life 5-
Dimensional [EQ-5D]), while patients are on study treatment

Overview of Study Design:
This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase 3 study evaluating orteronel plus prednisone, 
compared with placebo plus prednisone, in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC).  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue therapy will be continued unless the 
patient is surgically castrate.  Patients must have evidence of disease progression during or after 
receiving a total of ≥ 360 mg/m2 docetaxel within a 6-month period.  Patients who were clearly 
intolerant to docetaxel or have progressive disease before receiving ≥ 360 mg/m2 are also eligible if 
they have received ≥ 225 mg/m2 of docetaxel within a 6-month period and meet the other study entry 
criteria.  Two formal interim analyses are planned for this study.  Upon the recommendation of the 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to unblind the study, patients receiving placebo will 
be allowed to crossover to orteronel treatment.
Patients will return for regularly scheduled study visits (treatment/short-term follow-up) for as long 
as they:  1) continue to take study drug, or 2) discontinue study drug but have not yet experienced 
disease progression.  Patients will discontinue scheduled study visits if they experience disease 
progression and decide to discontinue study drug.  Patients may remain on study drug after disease 
progression and return for scheduled visits until they receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy.  The 
short-term follow-up portion of the study will no longer apply at the time of unblinding.

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9

All patients will be followed for survival (long-term follow-up) after discontinuing the 
treatment/short-term follow-up portion of the study.  Long-term follow-up will continue until death 
or discontinuation of the study by the sponsor.  

Study Population:
Men at least 18 years of age who have histologically confirmed or cytologically confirmed 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate that has progressed during or following 1 to 2 prior cytotoxic 
chemotherapies, at least 1 of which must have included docetaxel therapy.  Patients can be 
symptomatic or asymptomatic.  Patients must have progressive disease demonstrated by radiographic 
or PSA assessments, castrate levels of testosterone after surgical or medical castration, adequate 
renal and hepatic function and adequate bone marrow reserve based on laboratory assessments, 
adequate cardiac function, an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2, a stable medical condition, and a life 
expectancy of 6 months or longer.  Patients cannot have documented evidence of CNS metastases, 
prostate cancer limited only to the prostate bed or immediate adjacent tissue, uncontrolled 
hypertension, a QTc interval > 460 msec, or uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  
Radioisotope therapy or external beam radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug 
will not be allowed.  Prior ketoconazole, abiraterone, aminoglutethimide, or orteronel therapy will 
not be allowed.  Any other therapies for prostate cancer, except for GnRH analogue therapy, such as 
progesterone, medroxyprogesterone, progestins (megesterol), or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, 
finasteride or dutasteride) must be discontinued 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug.  Patients 
receiving placebo must meet additional criteria prior to crossing over to orteronel treatment. 

Duration of Study:
It is expected that the study will last approximately 36 to 38 months until reaching the final analysis 
of the OS endpoint.  Patients will be followed for survival until 80% of patients have died or are lost 
to follow-up.

performed according to this schedule until treatment with study drug is discontinued.  Testing for each cycle from Cycle 1 through Cycle 7 will be completed 
every 28 days on Day 1 of the cycle ( 3 days).  After Cycle 7, Day 1 testing will be performed every 3 cycles (every 84 days  5 days).

d Frequency of assessment is based on Cycle 13 as the starting point, eg, Q3C assessments would occur at the beginning of Cycles 16, 19, etc.
e Recording of vital signs and completion of EQ-5D questionnaires are required at unscheduled visits.  Other assessments should be done as clinically 

indicated

f Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression and receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy will not be followed centrally for disease 

progression but will be followed in the long-term follow-up portion of the study.

g Informed consent must be obtained before any study-specific procedures following unblinding are performed.
h A complete physical examination must be conducted at the screening and EOT visits.  At all other visits, physical exams may be symptom/disease directed.
i Vital sign measurements include diastolic and systolic BP, heart rate, and temperature.  Blood pressure will be taken after the patient has been in a seated 

position for 5 minutes.  At screening, patients may have 2 BP measurements taken no more than 60 minutes apart to exclude uncontrolled hypertension.  For 
eligible patients, only the BP measurement that confirms eligibility should be recorded on the eCRF.

j MUGA scans or ECHO; the same modality should be used for a patient throughout the study and the assessments should be performed at the same institution 

whenever possible.

k For Cycle 1, Day 1 only, all samples must be collected within 3 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
l DHEA-S, testosterone, ACTH, cortisol, and corticosterone samples will be collected prior to AM dosing.  
m If available and consistent with local regulations, archived tumor tissue collected at the time of original diagnosis or subsequent procedures (unstained slides 

or a paraffin-embedded block) will be obtained and evaluated to assess TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene product and other candidate biomarkers predictive of 
orteronel antitumor activity.  Archived tumor tissue can be collected at anytime during the study.

n All questionnaires should be completed before any other study procedures are performed.  The BPI-SF questionnaire should be completed first.  Patients will 

be asked to report their use of opioids during the 24 hours before the study visit.

o The 24-hour opioid-use data collected during the treatment period and short-term follow-up will be recorded on both the opioid-use and the concomitant 

medication eCRFs.  

p Patients will receive continuous oral study drug twice daily without a rest period.  
q After EOT, information on newly prescribed antineoplastic therapies will be collected every 3 months ( 30 days from the last dose of study drug).

Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9

1.   

BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE

Orteronel (TAK-700; International Proprietary Name under consideration) is an orally 
bioavailable, reversible, nonsteroidal inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in androgen 
synthesis.  This study is designed to investigate whether the androgen synthesis inhibitor 
orteronel improves overall survival (OS) in men with progressive, metastatic, castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that has progressed following at least 1 or 2 prior 
cytotoxic chemotherapies, 1 of which must have included docetaxel.

1.1   

Scientific Background

Prostate cancer (PC), the most common malignancy in Western societies, is a common cause 
of male cancer-related death in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), and 
Europe.  Although less common in Asian countries, perhaps related to both environmental 
and other factors, the rates of prostate cancer are rapidly increasing.(1, 2) Over the past 
2 decades, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, where it is used frequently, has 
significantly decreased the number of men who present with metastatic PC (mPC) at 
diagnosis from 20% in the 1970s to 3.4% in the 1990s.(3)  Despite the steady decline in the 
incidence of newly diagnosed mPC, following treatment(s) for localized disease, about 
one-third of patients will have recurrent disease within 10 to 15 years.  Although androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies can delay progression, mCRPC remains an 
incurable disease.(4)

Androgen deprivation achieved with medical intervention or surgical castration remains the 
mainstay of mPC treatment.(5, 6, 7, 8)  First-line medical ADT consists of a gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist, which may be combined with an 
antiandrogen (combined androgen blockade [CAB]).  Significant numbers of patients will 
have a clinical response to ADT; however, most will eventually develop progressive disease 
(PD; ie, mCRPC) despite castrate concentrations of testosterone.(9)  Salvage therapy for 
patients with recurrent mCRPC includes second-line hormonal therapy,(10, 11, 12) systemic 
chemotherapy, systemic radiotherapy,(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) or supportive care.

Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer

Currently, 3 classes of agents are widely used to treat PC that progresses despite ADT:  
antiandrogens (flutamide, nilutamide, or bicalutamide, unless previously administered),
adrenal androgen suppressors (ketoconazole or, less commonly, aminoglutethimide), and 
estrogens.  These therapies provide effective palliation, temporary tumor control, and

biochemical responses (decrease in PSA in approximately 40% to 87% of patients; 50% 
decline in PSA levels in 20% to 50% of patients).(19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24) However, each of these 
drug classes produces only modest, short therapeutic responses in patients with mCRPC.(24, 
25, 26, 27, 28)  Clinical experience with newer drugs that more selectively target androgen 
production and/or are more potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonists confirms that CRPC 
commonly remains hormone dependent.  For instance, treatment with abiraterone acetate, a 
reportedly irreversible steroidal inhibitor of both the 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase 
activities of cytochrome P450 enzyme 17 (CYP17), the key enzyme in glucocorticoid, 
androgen, and estrogen biosynthesis, demonstrated efficacy in preliminary phase 2 trials in 
patients with PD.  However, toxicities attributed to a syndrome of secondary 
mineralocorticoid excess have been noted with abiraterone and require administration of a 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or glucocorticoid to suppress adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH).(29)

Metastatic CRPC that advances despite these therapies is often treated with docetaxel-based 
chemotherapy.  Docetaxel is an antimicrotubule agent with significant clinical activity in a 
wide range of solid tumors.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other 
regulatory organizations in Europe and Japan have approved docetaxel in combination with 
prednisone for the treatment of mCRPC based on phase 3 data demonstrating a survival 
advantage (of 2.9 months) in comparison to the previous standard of care of mitoxantrone 
plus prednisone.(30)  Nevertheless, median OS of mCRPC remains less than 2 years.(31, 32)  
There is no standard therapy for patients with ADT- and docetaxel-refractory disease.

Development of Orteronel

Androgen receptors (ARs) remain active in patients with CRPC, suggesting that further 
diminishing testosterone synthesis beyond that achieved by medical or surgical castration is 
an important therapeutic goal.  Activity of ARs in the presence of low androgen 
concentrations may be due to AR gene amplification, increased coactivator expression, 
activation by growth factors, and selection of somatic AR mutations; the AR pathway is 
amplified in up to 20% of CRPC tumors.(33, 34, 35, 36)  In addition, many androgen-responsive 
genes become upregulated in CRPC cells.  Such tumors may respond to more effective ADT 
that suppresses circulating androgens and/or intracellular androgen activity.

Orteronel is a selective, nonsteroidal inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the 
production of the common precursor molecules for male and female sex steroid hormones, 
which are synthesized in both the gonads and the adrenal glands.  The selectivity of

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
orteronel for 17,20-lyase over 17-hydroxylase enzymatic activity may afford it a safer 
toxicity profile than agents that inhibit both steps in the testosterone synthesis pathway and 
may therefore affect cortisol precursor synthesis.  By disrupting the synthesis of testosterone 
but potentially not cortisol, orteronel could offer a more favorable therapeutic index in 
CRPC.  Whether orteronel confers therapeutic benefits in patients with advanced cancer is 
the focus of phase 3 and supportive studies.

1.2   

Nonclinical Experience With Orteronel

In vitro pharmacology studies indicate that orteronel is a potent inhibitor of human and 
monkey 17,20-lyase activity.  The enzyme activities of both 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase 
are associated with CYP17, with the specific enzyme activities likely depending on the 
phosphorylation state of the protein, and on available substrates and cofactors within the 
adrenal cortex.  In vitro, orteronel suppressed androgen production in monkey adrenal cells, 
human adrenocortical tumor cells, and mouse and rat testicular cells.  In vivo, orteronel 
potently suppressed serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) production 
and, to a lesser extent, cortisol concentrations in intact and castrated male monkeys.  
Detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of orteronel 
can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  

At high exposures, orteronel has been associated with myocardial atrophy and necrosis in 
rats but has produced neither adverse cardiac or cardiovascular events nor histopathological 
changes in beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys.  Data from 4-, 13-, and 26-week rat 
studies demonstrate an exposure threshold under which no adverse cardiac effects occur, 
even when daily dosing is extended to 26 weeks.

Orteronel induced histopathological hepatic changes, including centrilobular hepatocyte 
vacuolization, in rats at  10 mg/kg/day and in monkeys at 100 mg/kg/day.  These 
hepatocellular changes were generally mild and lacked corroborative evidence of increased 
liver enzyme concentrations in plasma.  Generally reversible, toxicologically significant 
findings were observed in the reproductive organs and the adrenal glands of animals treated 
with orteronel; these changes were considered secondary to hormonal shifts produced by the 
pharmacological action of orteronel.

1.3   

Orteronel Clinical Experience

Seven phase 1 clinical trials have been completed with orteronel in healthy male subjects:  
2 single-ascending oral dose studies using an immediate-release (IR) tablet formulation 

Confidential

25

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
(01-02-TL-700-001 and TAK-700/CPH-001), 1 single- and multiple-ascending oral dose 
study using a modified-release capsule formulation (TAK-700/EC-102), 1 relative 
bioavailability study of 2 IR tablet formulations (T1 and T2 formulations) (Study C21002), 
1 crossover study on the effect of food on the absorption of orteronel (Study C21007), 1 
study on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of orteronel (Study 
C21008), and 1 crossover, bioequivalence study of 2 IR tablet formulations (T2 and T3 
formulations [Study C21009]).   

The key observations from the studies in healthy subjects and those in patients with 
advanced mCRPC are that:

 Orteronel has dose-proportional, single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics 

(PK).  The PK of orteronel is linear.  The steady-state PK profile of orteronel dosed 
twice daily (BID) allows for consistent inhibition of adrenal androgen and 
testosterone production throughout the day.  Renal clearance accounts for at least 
one-third of the elimination of orteronel.

 Based on testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) data in healthy 

subjects and in patients with mCRPC whose baseline serum concentrations of 
testosterone were in the castrate range (< 50 ng/dL), doses of orteronel at 300 mg 
BID or above appear to be highly effective for androgen inhibition.  Orteronel
200 mg BID appears to be a less effective dose.

 Selectivity of orteronel inhibition of 17,20-lyase versus 17-hydroxylase activity is 

relative and appears to depend on orteronel dose.  At orteronel doses < 300 mg BID, 
there is little evidence of 17-hydroxylase inhibition.  Loss of selectivity, ie, partial 
inhibition of cortisol synthesis in response to ACTH stimulation and associated 
activation of the ACTH adrenal axis, is apparent in some men at 300 and 400 mg 
BID.  At 600 mg twice daily, some inhibition of cortisol synthesis is clinically 
evident with below-normal serum cortisol concentrations and impaired cortisol 
responses to ACTH stimulation.  Concomitant prednisone with orteronel doses at 
400 mg or above appears to suppress ACTH and thus diminish endocrine adverse 
events related to 17-hydroxylase inhibition.  Concomitant prednisone, through 
suppression of basal ACTH activity, is expected to support inhibition of adrenal 
androgen production.

 Orteronel appears to be generally well tolerated in both healthy subjects and in 

patients with mCRPC.  According to preliminary data from the ongoing phase 1/2 
study in patients with mCRPC (TAK-700_201):

o As of November 2010, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) reported by 9 or more of the 26 patients in the 
phase 1 portion of the study were fatigue, nausea, constipation, anorexia, 
back pain, and headache.  Grade 3 TEAEs experienced by 2 or more patients 
in phase 1 included fatigue (4 patients); diarrhea (3 patients); and 
hypertension, lymphopenia, pain in extremity, and vomiting (2 patients each).  
The most frequently reported TEAEs reported by 15 or more of the 
96 patients (15%) in the phase 2 portion of the study were fatigue, nausea, 
constipation, diarrhea, anorexia, headache, hot flush, muscle spasms, 
dizziness, back pain, and hyperglycemia.  Grade 3 TEAEs experienced by 
2 or more patients in the phase 2 portion of the study included fatigue
(9 patients), hypokalemia (5 patients), hyperglycemia (4 patients), diarrhea 
(3 patients), blood creatinine increased, hydronephrosis, hyponatremia, 
international normalized ratio (INR) increased, pneumonia, maculo-papular 
rash, and acute renal failure (2 patients each).  Non-serious skin rash has been 
observed in patients at doses of 300 mg BID or higher.  None of the skin rash 
cases required hospitalization.  As of 19 July 2010, decreases in LVEF 
greater than 10% have been observed in 8 (5 Grade 1; 2 Grade 2; and 1 not 
graded) of 99 patients in Study TAK-700_201.  See the IB for detailed safety 
information.

 The PSA response is the principal surrogate of efficacy in the ongoing 

TAK-700_201 study.  The efficacy of orteronel based on PSA responses after 3 or 
more 28-day cycles of therapy was similar for dose regimens of 300 mg BID or 
higher.  As of January 2011, 12 of 15 patients (80%) in the phase 1 portion of the 
study who received orteronel  300 mg for  3 cycles and had a 3-month 
(ie, 12-week) PSA determination had PSA decreases  50%, of whom 4 had 
reductions  90%.  Interim data for patients in phase 2 are qualitatively similar, with 
42 of 81 patients (52%) achieving a 50% PSA response by 12 weeks.  The results 
confirm that orteronel dose regimens  300 mg BID are similarly effective regarding 
the PSA response rate.

1.4   

Study Rationale

Patients with mCRPC who have progressive disease following docetaxel-based therapy have 
limited chemotherapy options.  Most often patients who are eligible for second-line 
chemotherapy receive mitoxantrone, an approved palliative treatment that improves Quality 
of Life (QOL), but not survival,(37, 38, 39)  Cabazitaxel (Jevtana®), a second-generation taxane, 
given along with prednisone has been shown in a single randomized, open-label, phase 3 
clinical trial to improve overall median survival compared with mitoxantrone plus 
prednisone in patients with progressive mCRPC following docetaxel-based therapy 
(15.1 months versus 12.7 months; HR 0.72).(40) In 2010, the US FDA approved cabazitaxel 
in combination with prednisone as second-line chemotherapy in patients with mCRPC.  In 
January 2011, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a 
positive opinion to recommend the granting of a marketing authorization for cabazitaxel in 
combination with prednisone or prednisolone as second-line chemotherapy in the European 
Union.  However, taxane-based, second-line therapy is limited by the adverse event profile, 
which includes hematologic, cardiac, and peripheral neuropathy events.  Additional phase 3 
studies are planned to identify an optimal dose of cabazitaxel in men with mCRPC that 
would maintain the survival benefit while reducing the adverse event risk.(41, 42)  Abiraterone 
acetate, an irreversible steroidal CYP enzyme 17 (CYP17) inhibitor of both the 17,20-lyase 
and 17-hydroxylase activities approved for patients with mCRPC who have received prior 
docetaxel, prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with mCRPC who had previously 

Confidential

28

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
received docetaxel chemotherapy.(43, 44)  Furthermore, abiraterone acetate showed 
improvement in progression-free survival and a trend in OS in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC 
patients.(45)  However, toxicities attributed to a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid 
excess have been noted with abiraterone and require administration of a mineralocorticoid 
receptor antagonist or glucocorticoid to suppress ACTH.(29)  Enzalutamide, an androgen 
receptor inhibitor, was recently approved in the US for treatment of mCRPC in docetaxel-
treated patients after showing improvement in OS compared with placebo in  patients with 
mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel chemotherapy.(46, 47)  The goal of this study 
is to determine if orteronel plus prednisone can improve the survival of patients with 
mCRPC progressing during or after docetaxel-based chemotherapy by inducing maximal 
androgen deprivation.

1.4.1   

Dose Selection

The orteronel dose selected for the phase 3 studies in mCRPC is 400 mg BID with 
concomitant prednisone 5 mg BID.  Orteronel 400 mg BID is a dose at which significant 
declines in serum PSA, testosterone, and adrenal androgen levels have been observed in the 
TAK-700_201 study.  Although 400 mg BID is not the maximum tolerated dose for 
orteronel, non-dose-limiting but significant fatigue occurred in men treated at the 600-mg 
BID dose level, indicating that the higher dose is not expected to be well tolerated.  The 
selection of the 400-mg twice-daily dose, the highest that is expected to be tolerated, gives 
the greatest potential for antitumor activity.  Although significant declines in serum PSA, 
testosterone, and adrenal androgen levels have been observed in patients treated at both the 
300-mg BID and 400-mg BID dose levels, it is not known whether decreases in the serum 
levels will be associated with similar reductions in testosterone and adrenal androgen levels 
in the bone and other sites of disease in patients.  To maximize potential for antitumor 
activity, it is appropriate to select 400 mg BID, the higher of the 2 doses, for the phase 3 
studies in mCRPC.  Orteronel 400 mg BID will be administered in combination with 
prednisone 5 mg BID in the studies in mCRPC.  Dosing in combination with prednisone will 
provide additional potential for efficacy and prevent the compensatory ACTH elevation that 
has been observed in some patients treated at 400 mg BID in the TAK-700_201 study.

1.4.2   

Continuation of Study Drug Treatment Following Radiographic Disease 
Progression

Patients will be allowed to continue study drug following radiographic disease progression, 
so that very low androgen levels are maintained, potentially slowing the rate of subsequent 
tumor growth.  Continuation of conventional ADT following disease progression is 

Confidential

29

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
recommended to prevent increased circulating androgen levels from interacting with the 
androgen receptor, which remains active in patients with progressive CRPC.  Maintaining 
castrate levels of testosterone with continued ADT despite the development of CRPC is 
recommended in both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the 
European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for treatment of prostate cancer.(48, 49)
This is based on the understanding that the androgen receptor remains active and reports that 
an increase in circulating androgens from castrate levels observed in patients receiving 
conventional ADT could accelerate tumor growth.(50, 51)  It is therefore likely that increases 
in androgen levels following discontinuation of the androgen synthesis inhibitor orteronel 
could also promote tumor growth.

1.4.3   

The Role of Prednisone

Role of Prednisone as Treatment for mCRPC

Prednisone administered as a single agent has antitumor activity as well as palliative effects 
on pain and quality of life (QOL) in patients with mCRPC.  Corticosteroids (ie, prednisone, 
dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone) have been shown in both phase 2 and phase 3 studies in 
patients with mCRPC to have antitumor activity, positive disease palliation, improvement in 
pain and QOL, and minimal toxicity.(52) In phase 2 studies with single-agent corticosteroids, 
50% prostate specific antigen (PSA) declines have been reported in 34% to 79% of patients, 
with time to progression of 2 to 9 months.(52, 53, 54, 55)  In phase 3 studies with glucocorticoids 
as a control arm, 50% PSA responses have been documented in 16% to 22% of patients with 
time to progression of 2.3 to 3.8 months.(52, 56, 57)  Response durations of greater than 1 year 
and prolonged symptomatic benefits have been reported.(52)

Role of Concomitant Prednisone for Orteronel Administration

As a treatment strategy, prednisone represents a minimally toxic therapy with several 
potential benefits for patients with mCRPC:  activity against PC with a positive influence on 
QOL, prevention of development of drug resistance, and prevention of mineralocorticoid 
surge.  In patients treated with other 17-hydroxylase inhibitors or in patients with congenital 
deficiency of 17-hydroxylase enzyme, inhibition of 17-hydroxylase results in transient falls 
in adrenal cortisol production with a compensatory rise in ACTH.  Increased corticosterone, 
resulting from increased ACTH, may compensate for the fall in cortisol and prevent the 
emergence of adrenal insufficiency; however, increased ACTH may be associated with 
increased adrenal androgen precursors.  The addition of low-dose glucocorticoids 

Confidential

30

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
(prednisone) blocks the physiological rise in ACTH and thus supports ongoing inhibition of 
adrenal androgen synthesis.  

Similarly, elevated ACTH results in increased concentrations of the aldosterone precursors 
deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and 18-DOC that may cause hypertension or edema.  This effect 
is also blocked by low-dose glucocorticoids.  Elevations in ACTH levels have occurred in 
some patients at doses of 400 mg BID and have been more pronounced at 600 mg BID.  
This suggests that concomitant glucocorticoid administration with orteronel at doses ≥ 
400 mg BID is likely necessary to support ongoing inhibition of adrenal androgens and to 
prevent or diminish certain potential adverse events related to the orteronel mechanism of 
action.

1.4.4   

Concomitant Therapy Selection

Use of Concomitant Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogue

Orteronel inhibition of residual levels of circulating (adrenal) androgens is most effective if 
used in conjunction with surgical or medical castration because blockade of testosterone 
synthesis normally results in a feedback increase of luteinizing hormone, which in turn 
promotes testosterone synthesis.  Consequently, all patients in this study will receive 
concomitant GnRH analogue therapy or will have previously undergone orchiectomy, which 
is considered to be the standard of care for patients with CRPC, and have a testosterone 
concentration of < 50 ng/dL.

1.4.5   

Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)

Recent advances in the detection and analysis of CTCs has provided insights into the 
process of cancer cell metastasis, and provided a noninvasive means for assessing the 
prognosis and therapeutic response for patients with cancer.  Circulating tumor cells are 
epithelial in origin and can be captured from whole blood using an antibody directed against 
the epithelial adhesion molecule EpCAM and magnetic bead separation technologies.(58)  
Investigations in breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer have shown that the number of CTCs 
in whole blood can serve as a prognostic marker.(58, 59)  Patients with metastatic CRPC who 
have ≥ 5 CTCs per 7.5 mL of whole blood have a shorter OS and PFS than those patients 
who have < 5 CTCs.(60)  In addition, recent data suggests that CTC enumeration may be a 
better predictor of patient OS than PSA decrement.(61)  Molecular analysis of CTCs may also 
provide further insight into the underlying mechanisms of metastasis and drug resistance.

1.4.6  

Rationale for Genotyping and Assessment of Biomarkers in Archived Tumor 
Tissue

Emerging data from studies of mCRPC are better defining the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the development of tumor sensitivity and resistance to hormone deprivation.  
Evidence indicates that upregulation of the AR gene can result in increased sensitivity to 
androgens.  Hormone-driven expression of the ERG oncogene after fusion with TMPRSS2
occurs in 30% to 70% of therapy-naïve PCs.(62)  Hormone-dependent overexpression of ERG
may persist in CRPC; tumors having TMPRSS2:ERG mutations may represent a subgroup of 
PCs that remain sensitive to CYP17 blockade.  Assessment of ERG rearrangements in 
therapy-naive CRPC tumors shows a significant association between ERG gene status and 
the magnitude of PSA decline (p = 0.007) in CRPC patients treated with abiraterone 
acetate.(63)  Two potential mechanisms of resistance to CYP17 blockade are AR mutations 
and loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which could result in constitutive 
phosphorylation of the AR, leading to ligand-independent activation.(64, 65, 66)  

Based on these observations, TMPRSS2:ERG translocation, AR, and PTEN mutation status 
in tumor cells will be assessed in tumor tissue as available from patients treated with 
orteronel.  In addition, if warranted by PK, safety, and/or efficacy data, genomic DNA single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be examined in the CYP17 gene or in other genes 
thought to play a role in predicting the safety or efficacy of orteronel.  The purpose of 
testing the archival tumor tissue specimens for DNA and blood samples for germline DNA 
is to identify biomarkers that will predict patient subpopulations that are more likely to 
respond to orteronel or have significant severe safety events.  The biomarkers will be studied 
in germline DNA isolated from blood and DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded archival tumor blocks of tissue collected either at the time of initial diagnosis or 
during a subsequent procedure as part of the patient’s standard of care.  The genetic 
biomarkers being evaluated from tumor blocks or tumor samples are specific to a given 
tumor type and not germline DNA.  In addition, CTCs remaining after completion of 
enumeration procedures will be assayed for the presence or absence of these genetic 
variations.  These data may come from a combination of information from this study and 
from future confirmatory studies conducted with orteronel in patients with prostate cancer.  
As new data emerge over the course of this trial, additional biomarkers may be examined 
based on new scientific findings related to the 17,20-lyase pathway, the effects of 
testosterone lowering and PC biology, or to the type and number of safety events that are 
observed.  The studies performed on the collected samples will add to our knowledge of 

Confidential

whether and, if so, which biomarkers might predict patient responses to orteronel.  This can 
lead to better treatment options for patients with prostate cancer.

Risks and Benefits

GnRH therapy is considered the standard of care in this study and will be managed as 
background therapy for the patients participating in this study.  The potential risks of 
orteronel and prednisone are outlined below.  

1.5.1   

Potential Benefits 

Potential benefits of orteronel treatment are discussed in Section 1.1.  A short summary of 
efficacy observed to date is provided in Section 1.3.

1.5.2   

Identified Risks

Orteronel

To date, clinical data with orteronel have been collected in phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects and in the phase 1 and 1/2, open-label studies in patients with different stages of 
prostate cancer.  The identified risks associated with orteronel treatment include, but are not 
limited to nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hypertension, and non-serious skin rash.  To mitigate 
the inherent risks in clinical studies of orteronel, patients are evaluated frequently while they 
are receiving treatment.  See the IB and Safety Management Attachment (SMA) for detailed 
safety information.

1.5.3   

Potential Risks 

Orteronel

Due to its mechanism of action, orteronel treatment may elicit adverse events typically 
associated with androgen deprivation therapy (decreased bone mineral density, 
hyperglycemia, and prolonged QTc interval).  Other potential risks include decreased left 
ventricular ejection fraction, hepatotoxicity, or adrenal insufficiency.  See the IB and SMA
for detailed safety information.

Androgen Deprivation Therapy

Patients in this study will be receiving ADT at study entry and will have castrate levels of 
testosterone.  Certain risks have been associated with ADT:  osteopenia and osteoporosis,(67, 
68, 69) metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia, central obesity),(70, 71) cardiovascular disease,(72, 

Confidential

33

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
73, 74, 75) and other adverse events (hot flushes, decreased libido, negative impact on health-
related QOL, impact on cognitive performance, fatigue, lack or loss of energy, loss of 
initiative, mood swings, and increased clinical depression and anxiety scores).(76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 
81)  With the exception of treatment-related fatigue, it is unknown if any of these risks will 
be altered by treatment with orteronel.

Androgens shorten the QT interval, which explains why the QT intervals in women and 
hypogonadal men tend to be longer than those in eugonadal men.(82)  As expected, prolonged 
QT intervals have been observed in men with prostate cancer treated with either GnRH 
agonists or antagonists, although few men had markedly prolonged intervals 
(ie, > 500 msec).(83, 84, 85)

Prolongation of the QTc interval has been reported as an AE for some patients taking 
orteronel.  No dose-related association or apparent effect with orteronel administration on 
ECG morphology was identified.  Patients with QTc intervals > 460 msec are excluded from 
the clinical trial.  

Other

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have been observed in some (8 of 99) 
patients enrolled in Study TAK-700_201.  These findings were in the setting of significant 
variation in LVEF measurements within the study.  No correlated trends in patient 
symptoms, electrocardiograms, or cardiac enzymes have been defined.  Additional 
functional data are being collected on patients on study drug to assess cardiac function.  

As of 29 September 2012, 4 SAEs of pancreatitis and 20 SAEs of elevated pancreatic 
enzymes were reported for patients with prostate cancer receiving orteronel.  All of these
cases were considered related to study drug by the investigator.  The role of orteronel in 
these cases remains unclear and a causal relationship between orteronel and pancreatitis has 
not been established.  See the IB for detailed safety information.

Adrenal insufficiency has been reported for 1 patient in the 600-mg orteronel BID-plus-
prednisone cohort in the phase 2 portion of Study TAK-700_201.  Adrenal insufficiency 
may occur, especially in men with decreased adrenal reserve or in men who have acutely 
discontinued supplemental glucocorticoids.

T-1358043, a process impurity, drug product degradant, and minor metabolite of orteronel,
tested positive for genotoxicity in laboratory tests and could potentially pose a risk to human

subjects.  The potential clinical implications of these laboratory results are that any resulting 
genetic or chromosomal change could potentially lead to secondary malignancy and raise 
the risk of heritable defects to offspring.

biomarkers predictive of orteronel antitumor activity, in archival tumor specimens

 The presence or absence of polymorphisms in germline genes related to the safety or 

efficacy of orteronel, such as the presence or absence of the A2 allele of the CYP17
gene

STUDY DESIGN

Orteronel tablets and placebo tablets will be subsequently referred to as study drug.

4.1   

Overview of Study Design

This phase 3 study will be conducted utilizing a randomized, double-blind, multicenter 
design to evaluate orteronel plus prednisone, compared with placebo plus prednisone, with 
continued ADT, in the treatment of men with mCRPC.  Patients must have evidence of 
disease progression during or after receiving a total of ≥ 360 mg/m2 docetaxel within a 
6-month period.  Patients who were clearly intolerant to docetaxel or have progressive 
disease before receiving ≥ 360 mg/m2 are also eligible if they have received ≥ 225 mg/m2 of 
docetaxel within a 6-month period and meet the other study entry criteria.

The patient population will consist of adult men who have histologically confirmed or 
cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, received 1 or 2 lines of prior 
chemotherapy of which 1 must have included docetaxel, and documented progressive 
metastatic disease, despite castrate levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL).  Patients may have, 
but are not required to have, opioid-requiring bone pain.  Prior ketoconazole, abiraterone, 
aminoglutethimide, or orteronel therapy will not be allowed.  Any other therapies for 
prostate cancer, except for GnRH analogue therapy, such as progesterone, 
medroxyprogesterone, progestins (megesterol), or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 
(eg, finasteride or dutasteride) must be discontinued 2 weeks before the first dose of study 
drug.

Approximately 1,083 patients will be randomized to receive orteronel tablets plus 
prednisone or placebo tablets plus prednisone in a 2:1 ratio.  Patients will receive study drug 
(orteronel 400 mg or matching placebo tablets) twice daily until radiographic disease 
progression is documented (see STUDY DEFINITIONS).  Each 28-day treatment cycle is 
composed of continuous twice-daily study drug plus prednisone treatment.  The study drug 
will be discontinued early if a patient experiences study drug-related toxicities judged by the 

Confidential

38

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
investigator to outweigh the benefits of the study drug.  Patients may discontinue therapy at 
any time.  

Upon the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to 
unblind the study, patients receiving placebo will be allowed to crossover to orteronel 
treatment.  Patients who remain on orteronel treatment will continue with their scheduled 
cycle visits.

Patients will return for the regularly scheduled study visits during the treatment and short-
term follow-up portions of the study for as long as they 1) continue to take study drug
(treatment), or 2) discontinue study drug but have not yet experienced disease progression
(short-term follow-up).  Patients may remain on study drug after disease progression and 
return for scheduled visits until they receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy.  
Unscheduled visits may occur between treatment cycles as required.  For example, 
symptomatic pain progression should result in an interim unscheduled visit, as would 
ongoing Grade 2 or worse AEs.

The short-term follow-up portion of the study will no longer apply to patients at the time of 
unblinding.  All patients will be followed for collection of information on any subsequent 
antineoplastic therapies and for survival (long-term follow-up) after discontinuing the 
treatment/short-term follow-up portion of the study.  Long-term follow-up will continue 
until death or discontinuation of the study by the sponsor.  

Patients will attend an End of Treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after receiving their last dose 
of study drug and will continue to be followed for other follow-up assessments specified in 
the Schedules of Events.  Patients discontinuing study drug prior to radiographic disease 
progression will continue to be assessed for radiographic disease progression during the 
short-term follow-up portion of the study.

Pain evaluation (using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form [BPI-SF]) will include 
quantified assessments of intensity, frequency and duration, degree of discomfort, location, 
and likely relationship to PC (versus prior therapy or comorbidities).  The pain response 
endpoint will be assessed at each visit and based on the prior 24-hour pain assessments using 
the BPI-SF worst pain score, rated on a scale from 0 to 10. Time to pain progression will be 
based on pain assessments using the worst pain item on the BPI-SF rated on a scale from 0 
to 10, collected as outlined in the Schedules of Events.  Analgesic use will also be 
documented as concomitant medications, the recalled level of analgesic use during the 
24 hours prior to pain assessment when progressing to Step II or Step III analgesics (refer to 

Confidential

39

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
STUDY DEFINITIONS and Section 15.2) will also be used to define pain progression.  
Patients who experience new onset cancer-related pain will have a confirmation assessment 
obtained at least 3 but not more than 5 weeks later.  Patients who experience new or 
worsening pain between scheduled visits should be seen at an unscheduled visit, if 
necessary, particularly after Cycle 7, Day 1 or when the next scheduled visit is more than 
4 weeks in the future.  Similarly, between study visits, patients may report the new onset of 
significant, possibly cancer-related pain, and an unscheduled visit for BPI-SF evaluation and 
treatment if necessary will then be arranged.  

Health-related QOL will also be evaluated through the patient self-reported instrument 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and an assessment of patient utilities with EQ-5D.  In addition to 
assessing selected symptoms, these instruments elucidate the effects of disease on physical, 
social, psychological/emotional, and cognitive functioning.  EQ-5D, but not EORTC QLQ-
C30, will continue to be assessed after unblinding.

Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.02.(86)  Adverse events will be 
assessed, and laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, and estimation of ejection fraction 
determined by MUGA scan or ECHO (the same modality should be used for a patient 
throughout the study) will be obtained to evaluate the safety and tolerability of orteronel.  

Radiographic evaluations (computed tomography [CT] scan and/or magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI] of the abdomen and pelvis, and bone scans) will be employed to assess the 
status of the patient’s underlying disease at screening and as outlined in the Schedules of 
Events.  Radiographic evaluations will not be collected routinely after study unblinding, but 
will be left to the discretion of the investigator based on clinical need.

Serial blood samples will be collected to quantify PSA and for scheduled safety and 
endocrine laboratory assessments.  Archived tumor material and a CTC sample will be 
collected to assess the presence of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene and other biomarkers 
predictive of orteronel antitumor activity, as appropriate.  Evaluation of the utility of these 
potential biomarkers of orteronel-mediated antitumor activity may require analysis of the 
data from this study in combination with data from other clinical studies of orteronel.  In 
addition, a blood sample for assessment of germline DNA polymorphisms will be collected 
from patients who consent to this optional procedure.  Studies of germline polymorphisms in 
CYP17 have been linked to PC risk and may play a role in outcome after therapy with 

Confidential

orteronel.  Analysis of these exploratory biomarkers may refine the understanding of the 
most appropriate therapies for patients with prostate cancer.  

Two interim analyses for OS are planned for this study.  Full details of the interim analyses 
are provided in Section 8.1.9.  

4.2   

Number of Patients

Following screening, approximately 1,083 patients will be randomized into this study from 
approximately 400 study centers worldwide.

4.3   

Duration of Study

It is expected that the study will last approximately 36 to 38 months until reaching the final 
analysis of the OS endpoint.  Patients will be followed for survival until 80% of patients 
have died or are lost to follow-up.

5.   

STUDY POPULATION

Confirmation of eligibility must be obtained from the sponsor or designee following review 
and approval of a “Patient Eligibility Checklist” prior to randomization.  See Section 7.4.  
After unblinding, patients who are crossing over from placebo to orteronel treatment must 
meet the criteria listed in Section 5.3 (criteria in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 no longer 
apply).

5.1   

Inclusion Criteria

Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

1. Male patients 18 years or older.

2. Voluntary written consent, given before performance of any study-related procedure 

not part of standard medical care, and with the understanding that consent may be 
withdrawn at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

3. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate histologically or cytologically confirmed.

4. Metastatic disease radiographically documented by CT/MRI or bone scan.

Confidential

41

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9

5. Progressive disease based on PSA and/or radiographic criteria, defined as 1 or more 

of the following:

 Radiographic disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 (refer to Section 15.1) in 

patients with measurable soft tissue lesions. For patients with bone disease, 
progression will be assessed following recommendations by the Prostate Cancer 
Working Group (PCWG2; refer to Section 15.1); appearance of 2 or more new 
lesions on bone scan, confirmed, if necessary, by other imaging modalities (such 
as CT scan or MRI) if results of the bone scans are ambiguous.

 PSA progression is defined as an increase in PSA, as determined by 2 separate 
measurements taken at least 1 week apart and confirmed by a third.  If the third 
measurement is not greater than the second measurement, then a fourth 
measurement must be taken and must be greater than the second measurement 
for the subject to be eligible for randomization in the study.  Furthermore, the 
confirmatory PSA measurement (ie, the third or, if applicable, fourth PSA 
measurement) must be  2 ng/mL.  Notes:  Determination of PSA progression 
can be based on results from a local laboratory.  The PSA value obtained from 
the central laboratory during the screening process does not have to be used in 
the determination of PSA progression, but that value should be at least greater 
than the first PSA used for determination of PSA progression.  If a patient has 
received prior antiandrogen therapy (eg, bicalutamide, MDV-3100), PSA 
progression must be evident and documented after discontinuation of 
antiandrogen therapy.

6. Prior surgical castration or concurrent use of an agent for medical castration (eg, 

GnRH analogue) with testosterone at screening  50 ng/dL.

7. Screening PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL.  (Screening PSA value must be obtained from the central 

laboratory.)

8. Must have received prior docetaxel therapy:

 Must have received ≥ 360 mg/m2 of docetaxel within a 6-month period.  Patients 

who were clearly intolerant to docetaxel or develop progressive disease before 
receiving ≥ 360 mg/m2 are also eligible if they have received at least 225 mg/m2
of docetaxel within a 6-month period and meet the other study entry criteria.

period and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or

 Agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

12. Screening calculated ejection fraction of  50% by multiple gated acquisition 

(MUGA) scan, or by echocardiogram (ECHO).  (The same modality should be used 
for a patient throughout the study.)

13. Stable medical condition, including the absence of acute exacerbations of chronic 

illnesses, serious infections, or major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization, 
and otherwise noted in other inclusion/exclusion criteria.

14. Life expectancy of 6 months or more based on general health and prostate cancer 

disease status as judged by the investigator.

Prednisone (or equivalent) will be labeled as investigational material and will be provided to 
investigative sites by the sponsor.  Packaging labels will fulfill all requirements specified by 
governing regulations.

6.2   

Study Drug Administration

Study drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the 
investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients may remain on study drug after disease 
progression until they pursue alternative antineoplastic therapy.  Similarly, patients who 
discontinue study drug due to AEs may continue in the study and undergo the scheduled 
study assessments until disease progression or until they decide to pursue alternative 
antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.

Study drug will be given orally twice daily (BID) throughout each treatment cycle of the 
study, except for dose modifications.  Study drug should be taken BID at the same time each 
day, approximately 12 hours apart, and may be taken with or without food.  Missed doses of 
study drug may be taken later, provided that the time of dosing is at least 6 hours before the 
next scheduled dose.  Note:  Patients who experience Grade 1 or 2 nausea or vomiting may 
be advised to take study drug with or following meals.  

Patients will be given a diary to record study drug dosing.  If a dose is missed entirely, the 
missed dose will be recorded as “not taken”.

Study drug compliance will be calculated for each patient by taking into account whether a 
patient takes all study drug as instructed.  Patients will be instructed to bring study drug to 
each patient visit for reconciliation.  The number of tablets taken will be calculated by 

Confidential

subtracting the number of tablets returned from the number of tablets dispensed.  The dosing 
diary will provide supporting information if necessary.

Prednisone will be administered 5 mg BID, orally, throughout each treatment cycle.  It will 
be taken at the same time as study drug.

Dose-Modification and Supportive Care Guidelines

The investigator should determine if an AE is related to study drug.  Adverse events 
considered at least possibly related to study drug may require a dose reduction (Table 6-1), a 
temporary hold, or permanent discontinuation.  

Depending on the AE, following partial or complete resolution of symptoms, the dose of 
study drug may be increased at 2-week intervals to the next higher dose level until the 
original dose level has been reached.  Guidelines for modification of dose based on the 
severity of the AE are provided in this section.  

6.3.1   

Dose Levels for Study Drug

The study drug dose levels to be applied for all dose modifications are defined in Table 6-1.

a Study drug is blinded.  Tablets contain either placebo (0 mg) or orteronel (200 mg).  The dose 

adjustments will be recorded in terms of possible orteronel dose in mg.  

6.3.1.1    Dose Modifications

Dose modifications should be based on NCI CTCAE (version 4.02).(86)  Dose reduction for 
Grade 1 AEs is not required.  Dose reduction for Grade 2 events should be considered only 
when the AE is judged by the investigator to be clinically intolerable.  For Grade  2 AEs, 
the dose modification should follow the Dose Reduction and Re-escalation guidelines 
(Sections 6.3.1.2 and 6.3.1.3, respectively).  For events of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 

Confidential

48

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
diarrhea, hypertension, rash, hyperglycemia, worsening renal function, and adrenal 
insufficiency, refer to the Specific Guidelines for Possible Study Drug-Related Toxicities 
(Section 15.6).  

Note that in all cases, dosing with prednisone 5 mg BID should be continued at the time of 
dose modification of study drug, including Dose Level 3 (dosing hold).  

6.3.1.2    Criteria for Study Drug Initial Dose Reduction

Dose modifications for Grade 3 or 4 events are described below.

 Asymptomatic Grade 3 or 4 laboratory findings may not require dose modification 

(ie, dose hold or reduction) especially if these are not considered to be clinically 
significant or related to study drug.  The decision to modify the dose should be based 
on the investigator’s clinical judgment.  Dose modifications for Grade 3 or 
4 hyperglycemia should follow the guidelines in Table 15-12 in Section 15.6.5.

 Grade 3 or 4 AEs that are considered at least possibly related to study drug require a 
dosing hold (Dose Level 3) for a minimum of 2 weeks.  For a clinically intolerable 
Grade 2 AE that is considered at least possibly related to study drug, the dose should 
be decreased by 1 dose level for 2 weeks.  The investigator should identify other 
potential causes of any AE or laboratory abnormality, and consult with the medical 
monitor for any questions regarding the need for dose modification.

Once the dose is reduced, reassessment is required at least every 2 weeks until the event is 
resolved or stabilized; however, the frequency of reassessment should be increased as 
clinically indicated.  If the grade worsens at any time, the dose should be decreased in 
accordance with the guidelines for the worst grade.

6.3.1.3    Criteria for Study Drug Dose Re-escalation

6.3.1.3.1    Re-escalation for Grade 2 Intolerable Adverse Events
Re-escalation of study drug after resolution or improvement of a Grade 2 intolerable AE 
considered at least possibly related to study drug will follow the criteria below:

1.

2.

If the AE grade improves to Grade 0, 1, or Grade 2 tolerable AE, re-escalate the dose 
by 1 level.

If the AE remains at Grade 2 and is still intolerable after 2 weeks, decrease the dose 
by another level.

Confidential

49

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9

3.

If the event worsens to Grade  3, hold study drug for 2 weeks followed by a 
reassessment.  Follow the re-escalation guidelines for Grade 3 or 4 AEs as described 
in Section 6.3.1.3.2.

Note, the above refers to AEs considered at least possibly related to study drug.  Reassess 
the AE after 2 weeks or sooner if the AE worsens.  Continue to reassess at least every 2 
weeks until the event is resolved or stabilized.  Continue to adjust the study drug dose until 
the dose is optimally titrated.  If the dose has been held (dose level 3) for 6 weeks, study 
drug should be discontinued permanently.

6.3.1.3.2    Re-escalation of Study Drug Following a Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Event
Re-escalation following a Grade 3 or 4 AE considered at least possibly related to study drug
will follow the criteria below:

1.

2.

3.

If the AE grade improves to Grade 0, 1, or Grade 2 tolerable AE, re-escalate the 
study drug dose by 1 level.

If the AE improves to Grade 2 but is still intolerable, hold dosing for another 
2 weeks.  Follow the re-escalation guidelines for Grade 2 intolerable AEs as defined 
in Section 6.3.1.3.1.

If the AE is Grade 3 or 4 after 2 weeks, hold dosing for another 2 weeks and reassess 
again after 2 weeks.  

Note, the above refers to AEs considered at least possibly related to study drug.  Reassess 
the AE after 2 weeks or sooner if the AE worsens.  Continue to reassess at least every 2 
weeks until the event is resolved or stabilized.  Continue to adjust the study drug dose until 
the dose is optimally titrated.  If the dose has been held (Dose Level 3) for 6 weeks, study 
drug should be discontinued permanently.  

6.3.1.4    Criteria for Discontinuation of Study Drug

If the event, considered at least possibly related to study drug, persists at Grade  3 for more 
than 6 weeks, permanently discontinue treatment with study drug.  The study drug dose may 
also be discontinued permanently if judged by the investigator to be clinically intolerable 
despite dose reduction, and the dose cannot be optimally titrated.

Precautions and Restrictions

It is not known what effects orteronel has on human pregnancy or development of the 
embryo or fetus.  Therefore, patients should avoid impregnating a female partner.  Patients 
should use effective methods of contraception through defined periods during and after 
study treatment as specified below.

Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to 1 of the 
following:

 Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and 

through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9

 Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual 

lifestyle of the subject.  (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.)

6.7    Management of Overdose

An overdose is defined as deliberate or accidental administration of study medication at a 
dose above that which is assigned to that individual patient.  In the event of drug overdose, 
the principal investigator should be notified immediately and the patient observed closely 
for adverse effects.  The patient should be treated symptomatically as appropriate, and the 
incident of overdose and related AEs and/or treatment should be documented in the patient’s 
medical record.  Patients who may have overdosed and who have possible manifestations of 
adrenal insufficiency may be treated acutely with parenteral or oral steroids as tolerated.  

6.8   

Blinding and Unblinding

At the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) upon 
review of the interim analysis (Section 9.1), the study may be unblinded based on evaluation 
of safety and efficacy parameters.  After unblinding and crossover of patients is complete, 
the procedures performed during the blinded portion of the study will no longer apply. 

To maintain the blind, all study site personnel will be blinded to the treatment assignments 
for the duration of the study.  

Kit assignments will be obtained through the interactive voice response system (IVRS) 
according to the procedures outlined in the Study Manual.  Information regarding the kit 
assignments will be kept securely at the sponsor’s location or designee per its standard 
operating procedures.  

Records of the patient number, the date study drug was dispensed, and the kit assignment 
will be maintained by the study site.

If the treatment assignment must be revealed for the safety of the patient or to treat an AE,
the investigator will contact the medical monitor (contact information is in the Study 
Manual).  A decision to break the blind must be reached by the medical monitor or designee, 
and the investigator.  The investigator or designee may break the blind through the IVRS 
independent of the medical monitor only if it is considered to be an emergency by the 
investigator.  The event requiring breaking the blind must be documented in the electronic 

Confidential

case report form (eCRF).  In addition, the patient will be discontinued from further study 
drug administration in this study.

6.9   

Description of Investigational Agents

Orteronel and matching placebo tablets are manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceutical 
Company, Ltd., Osaka, Japan.  Orteronel tablets and placebo tablets will be supplied as pale 
red, film-coated tablets and will contain 200 mg or 0 mg of orteronel, respectively.  Further 
details are provided in the orteronel IB.

6.10    Preparation, Reconstitution, and Dispensation

Orteronel is an antihormonal drug with anticancer activity.  As with other potentially toxic 
compounds, caution should be exercised when handling study drug.

6.11    Packaging and Labeling

Orteronel and placebo tablets will be packaged in round, white, high-density polyethylene 
bottles with a child-resistant cap with induction seal.  Each bottle of active orteronel or 
placebo study medication will be labeled with either a single-panel or multi-language 
booklet label containing pertinent study information, country-specific requirements, and a 
caution statement.

Prednisone (or commercially available equivalent) may be provided in bottles or blister 
packs and will be labeled per all requirements specified by governing regulations.

6.12    Storage, Handling, and Accountability

Orteronel and placebo study medication should be stored in the original dispensing bottles 
according to labeled conditions.

Prednisone (or equivalent) should be stored in its original packaging.  Prednisone supplied 
in bottles should be stored under the conditions indicated on the product label.  Prednisone 
supplied in blister packs should be stored as indicated on the label.(87)

Drug supply must be kept in an appropriate, limited-access, secure place until it is dispensed 
to the enrolled patients, returned to the sponsor, or forwarded to the sponsor’s designee for 
destruction.  Drug supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being returned 
to the sponsor.  Drug supplies may be destroyed on site if requested by the sponsor.

Confidential

54

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
The investigator must maintain 100% accountability for all study medication received and 
dispensed during his or her entire participation in the study.  If any dispensing errors or 
discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately.

The investigator must maintain a current inventory (drug accountability log) of all study 
medication delivered to the site, inventory at the site, and patients’ use records.  This log 
must accurately reflect the drug accountability of the study medication at all times.  The 
following information will be recorded at a minimum:  protocol number and title, name of 
the investigator, site identifier and number, description of the study medication, expiry 
and/or retest date, date and amount dispensed, and date and amount returned to the site by 
the patient, including the initials of the person dispensing and receiving the study 
medication.  The log should include all required information as a separate entry for each 
patient to whom study medication is dispensed.

Prior to site closure or at appropriate intervals, a representative from the sponsor or its 
designee will perform clinical study material accountability and reconciliation before 
clinical study materials are returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction.  The 
investigator will retain the original documentation regarding clinical study material 
accountability, return, and/or destruction, and copies will be sent to the sponsor.

The investigator will be notified of any expiry date or retest date extension of clinical study 
material during the study conduct.  On expiry date notification from the sponsor or designee, 
the site must complete all instructions outlined in the notification, including segregation of 
expired clinical study material for return to the sponsor or its designee for destruction.

part of the recruitment strategy, they will be reviewed by the institutional review board 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC).  It is not envisioned that prisoners or other 
populations that might be subject to coercion or exploitation will be enrolled into this study.

7.3   

Treatment Group Assignments

Patient eligibility will be established before randomization into the study as patients will not 
be permitted to re-enroll.  A centralized randomization and stratification using IVRS will be 
used.  Patients will be randomized strictly sequentially at a center as they become eligible 
for randomization and will be stratified as detailed in Section 8.1.2.  If a patient discontinues 
from the study, that randomization code will not be reused, and the patient will not be 
allowed to re-enter the study.

7.4   

Study Procedures

Refer to the Schedules of Events for timing of assessments.  The first dose of study drug 
must be administered within 7 days of randomization.  Additional details are provided as 
necessary in the sections that follow.

During the screening process, a “Patient Eligibility Checklist” must be completed and 
submitted by the investigator for review and approval by the sponsor or designee prior to 
patient randomization.  Completion of the eligibility checklist is necessary to verify that the 
patient has met all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Sections 5.1 and 5.2, 
respectively).  Source documentation that demonstrates that the patient has documented PD 
at study entry (Section 5.1, Inclusion Criterion #5) must be provided along with the 
checklist.  Unless specifically requested, additional source documentation does not need to 
be submitted with the checklist for the assessment of eligibility related to the other inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.  Completion of a second Patient Eligibility Checklist is not required 
at the time of study unblinding.

7.4.1   

Informed Consent

Each patient, or the patient’s legal representative, must provide written informed consent 
before any study-required procedures are conducted, unless those procedures are performed 
as part of the patient’s standard medical care.  Informed consent will be collected from all 
patients at the time of study unblinding.

7.4.2   

Patient Demographics

The date of birth, race, and ethnicity of the patient will be recorded during screening.

During the Screening period, a complete medical history will be collected for each patient.  
The history will emphasize the background and progress of the patient’s prostate cancer and 
include a description of all prior therapies for the disease.  The Gleason score at diagnosis, if 
available, will be recorded.  Complete medical histories will not be collected after the study 
is unblinded.  

7.4.4   

Physical Examination

A physical examination will be completed per standard of care at the times specified in the 
Schedules of Events.

7.4.5   

Patient Height and Weight

Height and weight will be measured at the times specified in the Schedules of Events.  
Height will not be measured after the study is unblinded.

7.4.6   

Vital Signs

Vital sign measurements include diastolic and systolic BP, heart rate, and temperature.  
Blood pressure will be taken after the patient has been in a seated position for 5 minutes.  
Vital signs will be performed at the times specified in the Schedules of Events.

7.4.7   

Concomitant Medications and Procedures

Medications used by the patient and therapeutic procedures completed by the patient will be 
recorded from the first dose of study drug through the EOT visit.  See Sections 6.4 and 6.5
for a list of medications and therapies that are prohibited and/or allowed during the study.  
Oral morphine equivalent (OME) score will be calculated from the narcotic medication 
information collected.

7.4.8   

Adverse Events

Monitoring of AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be conducted throughout the study as 
specified in the Schedules of Events.  Refer to Section 10 for details regarding definitions, 
documentation, and reporting of pretreatment events, AEs, and serious adverse events
(SAEs).

associated symptoms (eg, pruritus).  See Section 15.6.4.

7.4.9   

Cardiac Assessments

Cardiac assessments will be performed as specified in the Schedules of Events and as 
clinically indicated.  Assessments will include 12-lead ECGs and MUGA scans or ECHO; 
the same modality should be used for a patient throughout the study, and assessments should 
be performed at the same institution whenever possible.

7.4.10    ECOG Performance Status

ECOG performance status (see Section 15.3) will be assessed as specified in the Schedules
of Events.

7.4.11    Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed by a central laboratory.  Local laboratories 
may be used as required for acute management of TEAEs.  Handling and shipment of

Disease Assessment

Prestudy Documentation of Progressive Disease:

Patients must have documented PD either by radiographic or PSA criteria as defined in 
Inclusion Criterion #5 in Section 5.1.  

Both radiographic PD and PSA PD must be assessed to evaluate eligibility; however, only 
1 criterion (radiographic PD or PSA PD) must be met for Inclusion Criterion #5.  For the 
radiographic PD assessment, 2 sets of scans using the same imaging modality (ie, CT/MRI 
or bone scan) and taken at separate time points are required to document radiographic 
disease progression during or following the patient’s most recent antineoplastic therapy.  
Radiographic disease assessment is not formally required after study unblinding but is at the 
discretion of the PI with scans performed as per standard of care.  Patients are not required 
to have disease progression to cross over from placebo to orteronel treatment.

PSA will be assessed at time points shown in the Schedules of Events.  Results will be 
available to the investigators, but not to the sponsor.  PSA results will not be withheld from 
the sponsor after study unblinding.

Scans (CT/MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and radionuclide bone scans will be used 
to monitor and assess disease response and progression, as described in the Schedules of 
Events.  The imaging modality for each patient must remain constant throughout the study.  
Additional scans should be performed at the investigator’s discretion if progression is 
suspected or to confirm the existence of bone lesions.  Radiographic disease progression will 
be defined as described in the STUDY DEFINITIONS.

Radiographic images will be maintained at the site, and test results and physician’s findings 
will be filed in each patient’s source documentation.

Confidential

59

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
A central imaging center will review all films, images, and scans that are used in the 
documentation of progression.  The review will be performed on a “real time” basis at the 
time of possible disease progression.  Thus, investigators will be encouraged to await central 
imaging center review of images or scans that may indicate or confirm radiographic disease 
progression before recommending to the patient any treatment or management options, such 
as discontinuation from study drug treatment to pursue alternative antineoplastic therapy.  A 
separate radiography manual and instructions for archiving and submitting images or films 
for review will be provided.  The review of films, images, and scans by a central imaging 
center will not be performed after the study is unblinded, but scans may be performed by 
sites at the discretion of the investigator based on clinical need.

7.4.14    Tumor Specimen Measurements

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived tumor specimens collected at the time of initial 
diagnosis or during any subsequent procedure (tumor blocks or tumor material sectioned 
onto slides) or CTCs collected specifically for tumor biomarker analysis or collected for 
enumeration and subsequently fixed for further evaluation will be collected as described in 
the Schedules of Events and assayed for the presence of candidate biomarkers predictive of 
orteronel antitumor activity, including the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene.  All patients 
screened for the study will be asked to provide access to archival tumor specimens, if 
available, that have been stored from a previous procedure or biopsy.  If archival tumor 
tissue is available, and consistent with local regulations, patients would be required to 
provide an archival tumor specimen for biomarker assessment as described.  

Archived tumor specimens will be shipped to a central laboratory for processing.  Tumor 
material sectioned onto 10 to 20 slides may also be submitted.  Tumor block specimen 
material will be accessioned and any remaining material returned to sites on a quarterly 
basis.  Archival tumor specimens sectioned onto slides will not be returned.  Full 
instructions for processing and shipping of archived tumor specimens are provided in the 
Study Manual.

The archival tumor specimens will be only be identifiable by patient number and initials; 
sample labeling will be de-identified prior to statistical analysis.  The archival tumor 
specimen will be stored securely at the sponsor’s location or a designated central laboratory 
vendor until 10 years after orteronel receives approval from a governmental agency or until 
the orteronel program is stopped.  The storage period for these samples may be adjusted by 
country in accordance with local regulatory and/or legal requirements for the storage of 

Confidential

research samples.  Such changes will be reflected in the IRB/IEC country-specific informed 
consent form.  After that time, the samples will be properly destroyed by the central 
laboratory or designee following approval by the sponsor.  The investigator will keep 
records linking the patient identity with the samples for the time required by applicable law.  
Patients may also request at any time that their samples and material obtained from their 
samples be destroyed by contacting the investigator.  

7.4.15    Circulating Tumor Cells

Blood samples for CTC counts will be collected as described in the Schedules of Events.  
The timing of CTC blood sample collection may be changed if the emerging data indicate 
that an alteration in the sampling scheme is needed to better characterize the effect of 
orteronel.  The number of CTC blood samples may be reduced but not increased based on 
emerging data during the course of the study.  Instructions for processing and shipping blood 
samples for CTC counts are provided in the Study Manual.  At the central laboratory, the 
collected CTCs may be fixed for further evaluation as described in Section 7.4.14.  At the 
Cycle 1, Day 1 visit only, 2 samples will be collected (1 sample for enumeration and 1 
sample for biomarkers).  

To maintain the integrity of this blinded study, results from the CTC analyses will not be 
returned to the investigative sites during the active study period. Samples for measurement 
of CTCs will not be collected after the study is unblinded.

7.4.16    Whole Blood Sample for Germline DNA 

A venous whole blood sample (3 mL) for analysis of germline DNA will be collected at 
Cycle 1, Day 1 (before the study is unblinded) from patients who consent to this optional 
collection.  This is an optional part of the study and will not be a mandatory requirement for 
the continued participation of a patient in the study.  Patients who agree to participate in this 
optional part of the study must consent specifically for this procedure.  The DNA sample 
will be assayed using a Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-grade assay for the presence or 
absence of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the CYP17 gene.  CYP17 is the target of 
orteronel.  If, over the course of this study, emerging scientific data indicate that other genes 
may be responsible for predicting response to orteronel or that may predict a safety event to 
orteronel, then those genetic variants may also be examined.  

Individual blood samples for germline DNA analysis, including the result of the analyses, 
and corresponding identifying information will be identified only by a code in a computer 

Confidential

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
database.  Identifying information, such as the patient initials or patient number, will not 
appear on the tube in which the blood is stored upon processing; instead only the code 
number will be visible.  Once a sample is received, it will be logged into the electronic 
database.  To de-identify the patient, an “I” will be entered in place of the patient number 
and “---” will be entered in place of the patient’s initials.

The whole blood sample will be stored securely at the sponsor’s location or its designated 
central laboratory vendor until 10 years after orteronel receives approval from a 
governmental agency or until the orteronel program is stopped.  The storage period for these 
samples may be adjusted by country in accordance with local regulatory and/or legal 
requirements for the storage of research samples.  Such changes will be reflected in the 
IRB/IEC country-specific informed consent form.  After that time, the samples will be 
properly destroyed by the central laboratory or designee following approval by the sponsor.  
The investigator will keep records linking the patient identity with the samples for the time 
required by applicable law.  Patients may also request by contacting the investigator at any 
time that their samples and material obtained from their samples be destroyed.

Directions for sample collection and handling can be found in the Study Manual.  

Blood samples for germline DNA analysis will not be collected after the study is unblinded.

7.4.17    Pharmacokinetic Measurements

Blood specimens will be collected from each patient as described in the Schedules of 
Events.  Only the PK samples obtained from orteronel-treated patients will be analyzed for 
the plasma concentrations of orteronel and its metabolite, M-I.

The actual date and time of each PK sample collection should be recorded accurately in the 
eCRF.  

In addition, the following dosing information corresponding to each PK sample collection 
should be recorded in the eCRF:

 Time and dose of study drug taken by the patient on the day prior to PK sample 

collection and on the day of PK sampling (if the patient dosed himself on the 
morning of PK sampling).

The sampling schedule is outlined in the Schedules of Events.  Instructions for collection 
and processing of the PK blood specimens are provided in the Study Manual.

Blood samples for PK analyses will not be collected after the study is unblinded.

7.4.18    Pain Assessment

Pain assessments will be performed at study visits as described in the Schedules of Events.  
Patients who experience new or worsening pain between scheduled visits should be seen at 
an unscheduled visit, if necessary, particularly after Cycle 7, Day 1 or when the next 
scheduled visit is more than 4 weeks in the future.  At the unscheduled visits, pain 
assessments should be completed and appropriate management instituted.  In addition, 
patients who report new or worsening pain at either a regularly scheduled visit or are seen 
for pain at an unscheduled visit should have a follow-up visit 3 to 5 weeks later for 
confirmation of the pain progression and for appropriate pain management.  During the first 
6 cycles, this confirmation and pain management may be at the next scheduled visit (Day 1 
of the next treatment cycle).  After Cycle 7, Day 1, patients should be seen at an 
unscheduled visit within 3 to 5 weeks or at the next scheduled visit, whichever is earlier.  

The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) will be the principal pain assessment tool for 
this study.  The BPI-SF contains 15 items designed to capture the pain severity (“worst,” 
“least,” “average,” and “now” [current pain]), pain location, medication to relieve the pain, 
and the interference of pain with various daily activities including general activity, mood, 
walking activity, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.  
The questionnaire employs a 24-hour recall period.  The pain severity items are rated on a 0 
to 10 scale, with 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine.  

The PRO key secondary endpoint will be “pain response at 12 weeks” as measured by the 
worst pain item (Item 3) in the BPI-SF only.  

The use of the single item, worst pain, is supported by the Initiative on Methods, 
Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations for 
assessing pain in clinical trials and by the European Medicines Agency 2003 Guidance on 
Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for Nociceptive Pain issued by the Committee 
for Proprietary Medicinal Products.(88, 89, 90, 91)  In addition, the newly released FDA 
Guidance uses the following example while discussing conceptual frameworks:  “The 
conceptual framework of a PRO instrument may be straightforward if a single item is a 
reliable and valid measure of the concept of interest (eg, pain intensity). (92)”

Pain response is defined as the occurrence of 1 of the following and confirmed by an 
additional assessment, at least 3 weeks but not more than 5 weeks later:

 A ≥ 2 point reduction from baseline in BPI-SF worst pain score without an increase 

in analgesic use, or 

 A 25% or more reduction in analgesic use from baseline without an increase in worst 

pain score from baseline.

The date of pain response is the date of the first measurement.  Patients who have their first 
response detected at 12 weeks will be recorded as having “unconfirmed response” until the 
response is confirmed at least 3 weeks later.

Time to pain progression, time to pain response, best pain response, and duration of pain 
response are other secondary endpoints.  

Pain progression is defined as the occurrence of 1 of the following and confirmed by an 
additional assessment, at least 3 weeks but not more than 5 weeks later: 

1. The BPI-SF worst pain score is ≥ 4 with a  ≥ 2 point increase over baseline in BPI-

SF worst pain score with stable or increased analgesic use; 

2. The BPI-SF worst pain score is ≥ 4 but not less than baseline with new or increased 

(relative to baseline) Step II or Step III analgesic use; 

3. The BPI-SF worst pain score is ≤ 3 but not less than baseline with new or increased 

(relative to baseline) Step III analgesic use.  

Analgesic use can be stable or increased according to the following definitions:





Stable analgesic use is defined as less than a 25% change of the oral morphine 
equivalent (OME) dose from baseline.

Increased analgesic use is defined as an increase of 25% or more in OME from 
baseline.

Confirmation at least 3 weeks later is not required if surgical treatment for pain, palliative 
radiation for pain, or subsequent antineoplastic therapy has been received prior to a 
confirmatory assessment (refer to Section 15.2 for a list of Step II and III analgesics).

At the time of each pain assessment including unscheduled visits (See Section 7.4.23), the 
patient will be queried regarding concomitant use of opioid analgesics, if any, as specified in 
the Schedules of Events.  The patient-recalled amount of analgesic use during the 24 hours 
prior to pain assessment will be recorded on the opioid use and concomitant medication 
eCRFs.  

A full BPI-SF instrument will be administered at each of the visits as specified in the 
Schedules of Events to collect the pain severity, location, and interference information with 
a 24-hour recall period.  This must be completed prior to other assessments or study drug 
being administered.  Note that the BPI-SF is not completed beyond Question 1 if the patient 
denies significant pain that may be related to his cancer.  

Patients will complete the BPI-SF at each visit as specified in the Schedule of Events.  

7.4.19    Quality of Life Assessment

The QOL instrument, EORTC QLQ-C30, will be administered as specified in the Schedules
of Events.  

The EORTC QLQ-C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role 
functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global 
health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single 
items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties).  
The time recall period for this instrument is 1 week (the week immediately preceding the 
assessment).  It is a reliable and valid measure of health-related QOL in patients with cancer 
and takes about 11 minutes to administer.  The instrument consists of a brief (30-item) 
questionnaire that has been validated and used in many countries.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 data will be collected as specified in the Schedules of Events, and it 
must be completed before other assessments are performed or study drug is administered.

EORTC QLQ-C30 data will not be collected after the study is unblinded.

7.4.20    Utility Measurement

Because oncology therapies may positively or negatively affect a subject’s QOL, a common 
methodologic approach is used to quantify this effect by “quality-adjusting” survival in 
comparative treatment groups.  The result, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), is a measure 
of both the length and quality of life and is used as a measure of benefit in costutility 

Confidential

65

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
analysis.  General PRO instruments, such as the EORTC QLQ-C30, are not designed to 
measure subject preferences (or utilities) in a way that is suitable for calculating QALYs.  
Therefore, a separate validated instrument, in this case the EuroQOL EQ-5D, will be used to 
quantify utilities to calculate QALYs for a costutility analysis.

The EQ-5D is a 5-item questionnaire and a “thermometer” visual analogue scale ranging 
from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) that will be 
administered as specified in the Schedules of Events.  The utility measurement should be 
continually collected until the patient discontinues study drug.

7.4.21    Medical Resource Utilization Data Collection

During the treatment and short-term follow-up portions of the study (until the patient 
experiences radiographic disease progression), all medical care encounters will be collected 
from all patients regardless of the reason for the medical care encounter.  Each time an AE 
or unscheduled physician visit occurs, MRU data will be captured.  Examples of data to be 
collected are number of medical care encounters, such as inpatient/outpatient admissions, 
and major diagnostic and treatment procedures.

MRU data will not be captured after the study is unblinded.

7.4.22    Cost Assessment

The cost of treatment in each arm of the study will be assessed through the collection of 
MRU in each treatment arm of the study.  Valuation of the costs will be undertaken 
separately.

The cost of treatment in each arm will not be assessed after the study is unblinded.

7.4.23    Unscheduled Visits

Unscheduled visits may occur between treatment cycles as required.  Minimum assessments 
to be performed at unscheduled visits are described in the Schedules of Events.  The EQ-5D 
questionnaire should be completed as the first assessment.  Other assessments may be 
performed as clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.

7.4.24    Long-Term Survival Status

All patients will be followed for survival (long-term follow-up) after discontinuing the 
treatment /short-term follow-up portion of the study.  Every 3 months ( 30 days from the

last dose of study drug), information on newly prescribed antineoplastic therapies will be 
collected as part of long-term follow-up as specified in the Schedules of Events.  Long-term 
follow-up will continue until death or discontinuation of the study by the sponsor.  Patients 
in short-term follow-up at the time of study unblinding will move to long-term follow-up.  

7.5   

Completion of Treatment

Patients will be considered to have completed study treatment if they receive study drug
until radiographic disease progression (see STUDY DEFINITIONS section) or until 
discontinuation for unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death.

7.6   

Completion of Study

Patients will be considered to have completed the study if they are followed until death or 
until the sponsor terminates the study.

7.7   

Discontinuation of Treatment With Study Drug and Patient Replacement

Patients may receive study drug until:

 Withdrawal of consent

 Receipt of antineoplastic therapy other than study drug (or commercially available 

equivalent), including any experimental therapies

 Death

Study drug must be permanently discontinued for patients who initiate subsequent 
antineoplastic therapy.  Patients who experience disease progression may remain on study 
drug until they receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy or other therapy.  Patients who 
discontinue study drug will enter the long-term follow-up portion of the study per the 
Schedules of Events.

Treatment with study drug may also be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  

 Adverse event

 Protocol violation

 Symptomatic deterioration

Confidential

 Study terminated by the sponsor

 Withdrawal by subject

 Lost to follow-up

 Other

Within 30 days ( 10 days) of the date of study drug discontinuation, all study procedures 
outlined for the EOT visit will be completed as specified in the Schedule of Events.  The 
primary reason for study drug discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF.

Patients who discontinue study drug will not be replaced.

7.8    Withdrawal of Patients From Study

A patient may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:

 Lost to follow-up

 Study terminated by the sponsor

 Withdrawal by subject

 Other

The consequence of the patient withdrawing consent is that no new information will be 
collected from the withdrawn patient or added to the existing data or any database.  
Collection will continue if the patient is withdrawn for another cause.  In addition, survival 
information may be obtained from publicly-available records.

STATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES

A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized before the formal 
interim analyses.

8.1   

Statistical Methods

8.1.1   

Determination of Sample Size

The primary objective of this study is to determine if orteronel plus prednisone improves OS 
compared with placebo plus prednisone in patients with mCRPC that has progressed during 
or following docetaxel-based chemotherapy.  Assuming an exponential distribution for OS, 
a total number of 639 deaths is required with approximately 90% power to detect a hazard 
ratio of 1.32 (median survival of 15.8 months in the orteronel group versus 12 months in the 
placebo group) using a 2-sided log-rank test at a 5% overall significance level.  A total of 
1,083 patients will need to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either orteronel plus 
prednisone or placebo plus prednisone, assuming an average enrollment rate of 25 patients 
for the first 6 months, 65 patients per month thereafter, and a variable follow-up.  Variable 
follow-up means that each patient who has not dropped out or died will be followed until the 
trial ends.  Based on the enrollment assumption, the final analysis of OS is estimated to 
occur approximately 31 months from the enrollment of the first patient.  This period 
includes a 21-month enrollment period and an additional 10-month follow-up period from 
the time of the enrollment of the last patient.

Two interim analyses for OS will be performed when approximately 320 deaths (one-half of 
the total expected deaths) and when 426 deaths (two-thirds of the total expected deaths) 
have occurred, with the opportunity to stop the trial for overwhelming evidence of efficacy 
or futility.  These interim analyses (Section 8.1.9) will be tested at a significance level 
according to the O’Brien and Fleming type alpha spending functions.(93)  

8.1.2   

Randomization and Stratification

Eligible patients will be randomized to receive orteronel plus prednisone or placebo plus 
prednisone (with continued GnRH analogue therapy, as appropriate) in a ratio of 2:1, 
stratified by region (North America [US and Canada], Europe, rest of world) and BPI-SF 
worst pain score at screening (≤ 4 vs > 4).

8.1.3   

Populations for Analysis

The populations used for analysis will include the following:

 Safety population:  The safety population is defined as all patients who receive at 
least 1 dose of any study drug.  Patients will be analyzed according to the actual 
treatment they received.  Patients who received any dose of orteronel will be 
included in the orteronel plus prednisone arm, and patients who did not receive any 
dose of orteronel will be included in the placebo plus prednisone arm, regardless of 
their randomized treatment.



Intent-to-treat (ITT) population:  The ITT population is defined as all patients who 
are randomized.  Patients in this population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they were randomized to receive, regardless of any errors of dosing.

 Per-protocol (PP) population:  the PP population consists of all ITT patients who do 

not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would affect the study outcome 
significantly, as determined by the medical monitor, who is blinded to study drug 
assignment.  All decisions to exclude patients from the PP population will be made 
prior to the unblinding of the study.

 RECIST-evaluable population:  The RECIST-evaluable population is defined as the 

subset of patients who have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at the baseline 
assessment.

8.1.4   

Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data

All available efficacy and safety data will be included in data listings and tabulations.  The 
relevance of missing sample data will be assessed.  Data that are potentially spurious or 
erroneous will be examined according to standard data management operating procedures.  
Details on any sensitivity analyses and data handling details regarding issues such as 
missing data will be discussed in the SAP.

8.1.5   

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics

Demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, race, weight, height, and other 
parameters, as appropriate, will be summarized by treatment groups using descriptive 
statistics only.

Efficacy Analyses

8.1.6.1    General Methodology

Summary tabulations will be presented by treatment group and will display the number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables, and the number and percent per category for categorical data.  The Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable) will also be provided, along with 
their 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time-to-event data.

The SAP will be developed and finalized by the sponsor or its designee prior to unblinding 
of treatment assignment and the first interim analysis.  The SAP will outline all data 
handling conventions and specify all statistical methods to be used for safety and efficacy 
data analysis.  

Deviations from the statistical analyses outlined in this protocol will be indicated in the 
SAP; any further modifications will be noted in the final clinical study report.

8.1.6.2    Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint

The analysis of the primary endpoint, OS, will be based on the ITT population.  The OS will 
be calculated from date of patient randomization to the date of patient death due to any 
cause.  Patients without documentation of death at time of the analysis will be censored as of 
the date the patient was last known to be alive, or the data cut-off date, whichever is earlier.  
Two formal interim analyses for OS will be performed when approximately 320 deaths 
(one-half of the total expected deaths) and when 426 deaths (two-thirds of the total expected 
deaths) have occurred.  A detailed description of the interim analysis can be found in 
Section 8.1.9.

A 2-sided, stratified log-rank test will be used to compare the treatment groups with respect 
to OS (see Section 8.1.2 for stratification factors).  The test significance level at the interim 
analysis and final analysis is decided by the O'Brien-Fleming type of alpha spending 
function.  In addition, an unadjusted stratified Cox model will be used to estimate the hazard 
ratio and its 95% CIs for the treatment effect using the stratification factors.  The Kaplan-
Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable), along with their 2-sided 
95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.

The proportional hazards assumptions will be examined, and sensitivity analysis using PP 
population will be conducted.

8.1.6.3    Analyses of Key Secondary Endpoints

In addition to the primary comparison of OS, there are 3 key secondary endpoints:  50% 
PSA response (PSA50) at 12 weeks, rPFS, and pain response at 12 weeks.  The key 
secondary endpoints will be tested only once at 0.05 level when OS is significant.  A fixed 
sequential testing procedure will be used to test the key secondary endpoints.  PSA50 will be 
tested first.  Then the Hochberg method will be used to test rPFS and pain response at 
12 weeks in parallel.  The details will be fully described in the SAP.

Fifty Percent Prostate-Specific Antigen Response at 12 Weeks

The number and percentage of patients who have a 50% PSA response at 12 weeks will be 
summarized by treatment groups.  The PSA response rates between the 2 treatment groups 
will be tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test at a 5% 
significance level, stratified by the randomization factors.  The CMH chi-square p-value and 
the relative risk, along with its 95% 2-sided CI, will also be provided.  In addition, the 
absolute treatment difference in PSA response rates will be provided, along with the 95% 
2-sided CI.

Radiographic Progression-Free Survival

Radiographic progression-free survival is defined as time from randomization to 
radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier.  
Radiographic disease progression-free survival will be analyzed in the same fashion as the 
primary endpoint.  The stratified log-rank test will be used to compare the treatment effect 
and an unadjusted stratified Cox model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% 
CIs for the treatment effect.  The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians 
(if estimable), along with their 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment 
group.

Pain Response at 12 Weeks

The number and percentage of patients who have a pain response at 12 weeks will be 
summarized by treatment groups.  The pain response rates between the 2 treatment groups 
will be analyzed in the same fashion as the PSA response rates.  The CMH chi-square test 
will be used to compare the 2 treatment groups, stratified by randomization factors.  In
addition, the absolute treatment difference in pain response rates will be provided, along 
with the 95% 2-sided CI.

Prostate-Specific Antigen Responses and Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen 
Progression

The number and percentage of patients who have a 90% PSA response at 12 weeks, those 
who have a 90% PSA response at any time during the study, and those who have a 50% PSA 
response at any time during the study will be summarized by treatment groups.  The PSA 
response rates between the 2 treatment groups will be tested using the CMH chi-square test 
at a 5% significance level, stratified by the randomization factors.  The CMH chi-square p-
value and the relative risk, along with its 95% 2-sided CI, will also be provided.  In addition, 
the absolute treatment difference in PSA response rates will be provided, along with the 
95% 2-sided CI.

Duration of PSA response will be summarized descriptively.  Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
will be presented for each treatment groups, and no formal statistical comparison will be 
performed for this endpoint.

Time to PSA progression will be analyzed in the same fashion as rPFS.  The stratified log-
rank test and an unadjusted stratified Cox model will be used to compare the 2 treatment 
groups, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable), along 
with their 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatment group.

Quantitation of Circulating Tumor Cells

The number and percentage of patients who have a favorable CTC enumeration count 
(defined as < 5 counts/7.5 mLs of blood) at baseline and each scheduled assessment time 
point will be summarized descriptively by treatment groups.  

The number and percentage of patients whose CTC enumeration meet the following criteria 
will be summarized descriptively at each scheduled assessment time point by treatment 
groups:  convert from unfavorable (defined as ≥ 5 counts/7.5 mLs of blood) at baseline to 
favorable; convert from favorable at baseline to unfavorable; favorable at baseline and status 
unchanged; unfavorable at baseline and status unchanged.

The favorable CTC enumeration response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who 
convert from unfavorable at baseline to favorable.  The response rates at Day 1 of Cycle 3 
(8 weeks), Cycle 4 (12 weeks), Cycle 5 (16 weeks), Cycle 7 (24 weeks), Cycle 10 
(36 weeks), and EOT between the 2 treatment groups will be analyzed in the same fashion

will be used to compare the 2 treatment groups, stratified by the randomization factors.  In 
addition, the absolute treatment difference in CTC response rates will be provided, along 
with the 95% 2-sided CI.  

The relationship between changes in CTC counts and other clinical endpoints, such as OS 
and PFS, will be investigated in an exploratory fashion.  The details of this analysis will be 
specified in the SAP.  

RECIST-based Responses

The overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR; defined using RECIST 1.1 
and PCWG2 criteria) will be calculated in the RECIST-evaluable population (Section 8.1.3).  
The ORR will be tabulated descriptively with 95% CIs.  The DOR will be analyzed using 
standard survival analysis techniques based on Kaplan-Meier estimates.  In addition, the 
comparison of ORR between the 2 treatment groups will be tested using the CMH chi-
square test at a 5% significance level stratified by the randomization factors.

8.1.7   

Safety Analysis

Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of TEAEs, severity and type of AEs, and by 
changes from baseline in the patient’s vital signs, weight, ECOG performance status, ECG, 
cardiac ejection fraction test results (MUGA or ECHO), and clinical laboratory results using 
the safety population.  Exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation will be 
tabulated.

All TEAEs will be tabulated.  A TEAE is defined as any AE that occurs after administration 
of the first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, any event 
that is considered drug related regardless of the start date of the event, or any event that is 
present at baseline but worsens in severity after baseline or is subsequently considered drug 
related by the investigator.  Adverse events will be tabulated according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by system organ class (SOC), high-level 
term (HT), and preferred terms (PTs) and will include the following categories:  

 TEAEs

 Study drugrelated TEAEs

 Grade 3 or higher TEAEs

The most commonly reported TEAEs (ie, those events reported by  10% of all patients) 
will be tabulated by HT and PT.  A listing of treatment-emergent AEs resulting in study 
drug discontinuation will be provided.

Descriptive statistics for both the actual values and change from baseline values of the 
clinical laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry) will be presented for all 
scheduled measurements over time.  Mean laboratory values over time will be plotted for 
key laboratory parameters.  Shift tables for laboratory parameters will be generated based on 
changes in NCI CTCAE grade from baseline to the worst postbaseline value.

Descriptive statistics for the actual values (and/or the changes from baseline) of vital signs 
and weight over time will be tabulated by scheduled time point.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and change from baseline will be 
summarized.

All concomitant medications collected from first dose of study drug through the study period 
will be classified to PTs according to the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary.

Investigators’ assessments of ECG monitoring (normal, abnormal and clinically significant, 
or abnormal and not clinically significant), including unscheduled or retested measurements, 
will be documented on the appropriate eCRF.

Additional safety analyses may be performed to most clearly establish rates of toxicities and 
further define the safety profile of orteronel.  The baseline for crossover patients is after 
unblinding and just prior to the first dose of orteronel administration.

Quality of Life Assessment:  HRQOL Response Rate

The global health status/QOL secondary endpoint will be measured as the HRQOL response 
rate at 12 weeks using the 2-item global health status index of the EORTC QLQ-C30 
instrument.  HRQOL response is defined as a 17-point increase from the baseline 
assessment on the QOL index, after the score has been linearly transformed to a 0 to 
100 scale (see EORTC scoring manual and SAP for details).  A confirmatory measurement 
obtained at least 3 weeks later will be required.  The HRQOL response rates between the 
2 treatment groups will be tested using the CMH chi-square test at a 5% significance level, 
stratified by the randomization factors.  The CMH chi-square p-value and the relative risk, 
along with the 95% 2-sided CI will also be provided.  In addition, the absolute treatment 
difference in HRQOL response rates will be provided along with the 95% 2-sided CI.

Additional Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) analysis will also be used to compare 
QOL response differences between the two arms with respect to differences from baseline to 
12 weeks and 24 weeks using the 2-item global health status index of the EORTC QLQ-C30 
instrument.  CDF does not require a pre-specified threshold for response.  Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test will be employed for the comparison of two arms.  

Best Pain Response

The number and percent of patients who have a pain response will be summarized by 
treatment groups.  The pain response rates between the 2 treatment groups will be analyzed

compare the 2 treatment groups, stratified by the randomization factors.  In addition, the 
absolute treatment difference in pain response rates will be provided, along with the 95% 
2-sided CI.

Time to Pain Progression

Time to pain progression will be analyzed in the same fashion as the key PRO endpoint.  
The stratified log-rank test and an unadjusted stratified Cox model will be used to estimate 
the hazard ratio and its 95% CIs for the treatment effect using the stratification factors.  The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Kaplan-Meier medians (if estimable), along with their 2-

Time to pain response and duration of pain response will be summarized descriptively.  The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be presented for each treatment group, and no formal 
statistical comparison will be performed for these endpoints.

EORTC QLQ-C30

Descriptive summaries of the observed data will be provided for EORTC QLQ-C30 at each 
scheduled assessment time point.  Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models will be used 
to compare the treatment groups with respect to outcomes, controlling for the baseline score 
and stratification factors.  Two-sided 95% CI will be calculated for the differences between 
the 2 treatment groups.  Longitudinal models will also be examined for the treatment 
comparisons.

Health Economics Analysis Using MRU and Utility

The primary health economic outcome is costutility, defined as the difference in the total 
costs of the orteronel group versus the control group, divided by the difference in the 
QALYs accrued by patients in both study groups of the study.

Costs will be assigned to the medical care encounters and concomitant medications at the 
conclusion of the trial.  These costs will be assigned by matching medical resource data 
collected on the MRU, Concomitant Medications, Adverse Event, Concomitant Procedures, 
and Serious Adverse Event Summary eCRFs to databases containing standardized costs for 
these resources.

Utilities will be calculated using the appropriate scoring algorithms for the EQ-5D.  Average 
utilities for both treatment arms will be multiplied by the average survival in each group to 
determine QALYs.

The secondary health economic outcomes include:  1) costeffectiveness analysis, defined 
similarly to costutility analysis with the exception that the denominator of the ratio is life-
years gained (not quality-adjusted); 2) total costs by treatment; and 3) frequency of MRU by 
treatment.

The economic data will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach.  Secondary analyses 
using patient populations defined by various measures of protocol compliance will also be

percentage).

Data for continuous variables will be summarized using measures of central tendency and 
dispersion.  Variables will be compared between the orteronel and the placebo groups using 
appropriate methods:  CI, rather than p-values, will be emphasized.

8.1.9   

Interim Analyses

Two formal interim analyses of OS are planned when approximately one-half (320) and 
two-thirds (426) of the total expected deaths (639) have occurred during the study.  The 
interim analyses will be conducted at a significance level according to O’Brien and Fleming 
type alpha spending functions.  Based on the projected number of deaths, the trial will be 
stopped for overwhelming efficacy at the first interim analysis if the observed p-value is 
 0.0031 and the trial would be stopped for futility if the observed p-value is  0.8343.  At 
the second interim analysis, the trial will be stopped for overwhelming efficacy if the 
observed p-value is  0.0111 and the trial would be stopped for futility if the observed p-
value is  0.4275.  The trial may be stopped for clear evidence of efficacy or futility.  If the 
study does not stop early at the interim analyses, a final p value of  0.0461 is required to be 
statistically significant at the final analysis of OS.

STUDY COMMITTEES

9.1   

Independent Data Monitoring Committee

An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review safety and efficacy data at 
the interim analyses.  The IDMC will provide a recommendation regarding study 
continuation based on the safety and efficacy parameters.  In the event that the study is 
terminated early based on an IDMC recommendation, the sponsor will notify the appropriate 
regulatory authorities.  In addition, the IDMC will periodically review safety data at 
regularly scheduled meetings prespecified in the IDMC charter.  Intensive safety monitoring 
will be performed in the early portion of the study.  The first formal safety review will occur 
after approximately 100 subjects have been randomized and received at least 1 cycle of 
study treatment.  Subsequently, periodic safety reviews will also occur as prespecified in the 
IDMC charter.  

10.    ADVERSE EVENTS

10.1    Definitions

10.1.1    Adverse Event Definition

Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to 
the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition 
that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.

An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline.

10.1.2    Serious Adverse Event Definition

Serious adverse event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

 Results in death.

Confidential

79

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9



Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).

 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization (see 

clarification in the paragraph below on planned hospitalizations).

 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  (Disability is defined as a 

substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).





Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

Is a medically important event.  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or 
involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein transmitting 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  

In this study, intensity for each AE, including any laboratory abnormality, will be 
determined using the NCI CTCAE (version 4.02).(86)  Clarification should be made between 
a SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms 
serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe is often used to describe 
the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT the same as serious, 
which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability to function.  A severe 
AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, a 
Leukocyte value of 1000 to 2000/mm3 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be 
considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.

10.1.3    Pretreatment Event Definition

A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has 
signed informed consent to participate in a study but before administration of any study 
medication; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study 
participation.  A serious pretreatment AE meets the criterion of a pretreatment event (as 
above) and satisfies any 1 of the 6 criteria specified for an SAE as shown in Section 10.1.2
(results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of present 
hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, or is a medically important event).

10.2    Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 

Events 

All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.4 for the
period of observation).  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a 
common underlying pathology should be noted as 1 comprehensive event.

Regardless of causality, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section 10.1) 
must be reported (see Section 10.4 for the period of observation) by the investigator to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance’s designee, PPD, (contact information 
provided below).  This should be done by faxing the SAE Form within 24 hours after 
becoming aware of the event.  The SAE Form, created specifically by Millennium, will be 
provided to each clinical study site.  A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study 
Manual.  Follow-up information on the SAE or serious pretreatment event may be requested 
by Millennium.  SAE report information must be consistent with the data provided on the 
eCRF.

Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the condition 
deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (eg, surgery was performed earlier or 
later than planned).

For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of 
the event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration.  For serious 
pretreatment events, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study procedures.

Intensity for each AE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined using the NCI 
CTCAE (version 4.02).(86)  The criteria are provided in the Study Manual and also are 
available online at ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.

Relationship to study drug administration will be determined by the investigator responding 
yes or no to this question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with the 
study drug?

10.3    Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions

The sponsor will expedite the reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to 
concerned regulatory authorities, independent ethics committees, and investigators in 
accordance with all relevant laws and regulations governing the reporting of adverse drug 
reactions from clinical trials.

For purposes of regulatory reporting, expectedness will be based on the orteronel IB.

10.4    Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation

AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be monitored throughout the study as follows:

 AEs will be reported from the first dose of study drug through 30 days after 

treatment with the last dose of study drug or the start of subsequent antineoplastic 
therapy, whichever occurs first, and recorded in the eCRFs.  That is, if a patient 

Confidential

82

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9

begins a new antineoplastic therapy, the AE reporting period for nonserious AEs 
ends at the time the new treatment is started.  

 Serious pretreatment events will be reported to the Millennium Department of 

Pharmacovigilance or designee from the time of the signing of the ICF up to first 
dose of study drug, but will not be recorded in the eCRF.  

 Related and unrelated serious adverse events will be reported to the Millennium 

Department of Pharmacovigilance or PPD from the first dose of study drug through 
the last treatment visit (30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug) 
and recorded in the eCRFs.  After this period, only related SAEs must be reported to 
the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee.  SAEs should be 
monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s 
stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).

10.5    Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events

If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s 
participation in this study, the sponsor must also be contacted immediately by faxing a 
completed Pregnancy Form to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance (see 
Section 10.2).  Every effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy 
outcome.

11.    ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS

11.1    Good Clinical Practice

The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the appropriate regulatory 
requirement(s).  The investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the 
study drug as described in the protocol and the IB.

11.2    Data Quality Assurance

The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study 
patient.  Study data will be entered into an eCRF by site personnel using a secure, validated, 

Confidential

83

Orteronel (TAK-700)
Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9
web-based electronic data capture (EDC) application.  The sponsor will have access to all 
data upon entry in the EDC application.  

Study monitors will discuss instances of missing or uninterpretable data with the 
investigator for resolution.  Any changes to study data will be made to the eCRF and 
documented via an electronic audit trail associated with the affected eCRF.

11.3    Electronic Case Report Form Completion 

The sponsor or designee will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on 
the EDC application, sufficient to permit site personnel to enter or correct information in the 
eCRFs for the patients for whom they are responsible.

eCRFs will be completed for each study patient.  It is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the 
patient’s eCRF.

The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as 
possible after information is collected.

The investigator must provide through the EDC application formal approval of all the 
information in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endorse the final submitted data for 
the patients for which he or she is responsible.  The audit trail entry will show the user’s 
identification information and the date and time of the correction.

The sponsor, or a designee, will retain the eCRF data and corresponding audit trails.  A copy 
of the final archival eCRF in the form of a compact disk or other electronic media will be 
placed in the investigator’s study file.

11.4    Study Monitoring

Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by the sponsor will be followed 
to comply with GCP guidelines.

All information recorded on the eCRFs for this study must be consistent with the patient’s 
source documentation.  During the course of the study, the study monitor will make study 
site visits to review protocol compliance, verify eCRFs against source documentation, assess 
drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent 
regulatory requirements.  The review of medical records will be performed in a manner that 
ensures that patient confidentiality is maintained.

11.5    Ethical Considerations

The study will be conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and 
will adhere to GCP standards.  The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study 
documentation to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of the patients.  The study will 
be conducted only at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained.  The protocol, IB, 
ICF, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the patients (including 
diary cards), safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents 
will be provided to the IRB/IEC by the investigator or the sponsor, as allowed by local 
regulations.

11.6    Patient Information and Informed Consent

After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from 
either the patient or his/her guardian or legal representative before study participation.  The 
method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent 
must comply with the ICH GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements.

11.7    Patient Confidentiality

To maintain patient privacy, all eCRFs, study drug accountability records, study reports, and 
communications will identify the patient by initials where permitted and/or by the assigned 
patient number.  The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made 
publicly available to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations.

11.8   

Investigator Compliance

The investigator will conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol provided by the 
sponsor and given approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC and the appropriate 
regulatory authority(ies).  Modifications to the protocol are not to be made without 
agreement of both the investigator and the sponsor.  Changes to the protocol will require 
written IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion before implementation, except when the 
modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard or hazards to patients.  The 
sponsor, or a designee, will submit all protocol modifications to the appropriate regulatory 
authority(ies) in accordance with the governing regulations.

When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard 
or hazards to patients, the investigator will contact the sponsor, or a designee, if 

Confidential

protocol must be documented.

11.9    On-site Audits

Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC, and/or the sponsor may request access to all source 
documents, eCRFs, and other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection.  Direct 
access to these documents must be guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support 
at all times for these activities.

11.10    Investigator and Site Responsibility for Drug Accountability

Accountability for the study drug at the trial site is the responsibility of the investigator.  
Drug accountability records indicating the drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the 
site, use by each patient, and amount returned to the sponsor, or a designee (or disposal of 
the drug, if approved by the sponsor) will be maintained by the clinical site.  The sponsor or 
its designee will review drug accountability at the site on an ongoing basis.

All material containing study drug will be treated and disposed of in accordance with 
governing regulations.

11.11    Product Complaints 

A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies dissatisfaction 
regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality, or stability of a drug product.  Individuals 
who identify a potential product complaint situation should immediately contact MedComm 
Solutions (see below) and report the event.  Whenever possible, the associated product 
should be maintained in accordance with the label instructions pending further guidance
from a Millennium Quality representative.

11.12    Closure of the Study

Within 90 days of the end of the study, the sponsor will notify the competent authorities and 
the IRBs/IECs in all member states where the study is being carried out that the study has 
ended.

Within 1 year of the end of the study, a summary of the clinical trial results will be 
submitted to the competent authorities and IRBs/IECs in all member states involved in the 
study.

Study participation by individual sites or the entire study may be prematurely terminated if, 
in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor, there is sufficient reasonable cause.  
Written notification documenting the reason for study termination will be provided to the 
investigator or the sponsor by the terminating party.

Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:

 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients

 Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate





Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements

Insufficient, incomplete, and/or unevaluable data

 Determination of efficacy based on interim analyses

 Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of the study drug

Should the study be closed prematurely, the site will no longer be able to access the EDC 
application, will not have a right to use the EDC application, and will cease using the 
password or access materials once their participation in the study has concluded.  In the 
event that any access devices for the EDC application have been provided, these will be 
returned to the sponsor once the site’s participation in the study has concluded.

Within 15 days of premature closure, the sponsor must notify the competent authorities and 
IRBs/IECs of any member state where the study is being conducted, providing the reasons 
for study closure.

regulatory requirement(s).  Records will be retained for at least 2 years after the last 
marketing application approval or 2 years after formal discontinuation of the clinical 
development of the investigational product or according to applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).  If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study 
records, custody must be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and the 
sponsor notified.

12.    USE OF INFORMATION

All information regarding orteronel supplied by the sponsor to the investigator is privileged 
and confidential information.  The investigator agrees to use this information to accomplish 
the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from the sponsor.  It is 
understood that there is an obligation to provide the sponsor with complete data obtained 
during the study.  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used toward the 
development of orteronel and may be disclosed to regulatory authority(ies), other 
investigators, corporate partners, or consultants as required.

Upon completion of the clinical study and evaluation of results by the sponsor, the hospital 
or institution and/or investigator may publish or disclose the clinical trial results pursuant to 
the terms contained in the applicable Clinical Trial Agreement.

It is anticipated that the results of this study will be presented at scientific meetings and/or 
published in a peer-reviewed scientific or medical journal.  A publications plan will be 
developed by the sponsor employees and study investigators.  Subsequently, individual 
investigators may publish results from the study in compliance with their agreements with 
the sponsor.

15.    APPENDICES

15.1    Radiographic Disease Assessment According to Prostate Cancer Clinical 

Trials Working Group (PCWG2) and Modified Response Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1)

Radiographic Disease Assessment will be performed using the PCWG2 guidelines.  The 
PCWG2 recommended that for soft tissue lesions that RECIST 1.1 assessment be applied 
and that results be compiled separately from the overall disease assessment, which includes 
both bone scan and RECIST 1.1 results.  

Under RECIST 1.1, radionuclide bone scan lesions are considered not measurable, and 
hence nontarget.  Under RECIST, bone scan progression occurs when the changes are 
“unequivocal.”  Under PCWG2, however, radionuclide bone scan results are treated semi-
quantitatively and occurrence of new lesions may define progression as outlined further 
below.  For this protocol, soft tissue and bone scan disease are evaluated separately, and the 
results of each are then considered in an overall radiographic disease assessment.

15.1.1    Recording Baseline Assessments

All sites of disease, target and nontarget lesions must be assessed at baseline.  Objective 
disease status is to be recorded at each evaluation using the response categories and 
definitions provided in this section.

15.1.1.1    Soft Tissue Lesion Assessment

Selection of Target and Nontarget Lesions 

All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability for 
reproducible repeated measurements.  Measurements must be provided for target measurable 
lesions.

Selection of a Lymph Node as a Target Lesion

Only lymph nodes with the longest diameter of ≥ 2 cm,(94) and a minimum short axis 
diameter of ≥ 1.5 cm by CT scan will be considered as target lesions at baseline.  All other

lesions may be considered as nontarget, and are to be identified but not specifically 
measured at baseline, with the exception of bone scan metastases, which are identified and 
enumerated.  

15.1.1.2    Soft Tissue Assessments Following Baseline

Confirmation of response is not required, except as follows: 

If either 1) a new soft tissue lesions or 2) a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions (see below) are identified at the first follow-up assessment after start of study drug, 
then the new lesions or increase in sum of diameters must be confirmed as still present at the 
second follow-up assessment 6 or more weeks later.  

Beginning at the second follow-up assessment and thereafter, no subsequent confirmation is 
required for 1) newly occurring soft tissue lesions; or 2) a new increase in lesion sum of 
diameters meeting disease progression criteria, or 3) unequivocal progression of non-target 
soft tissue lesions.  

For the assessment of lymph nodes, only report changes in lymph nodes that were 2 cm in 
the longest diameter at baseline.(94)

15.1.2    Response Definitions for RECIST-Evaluable Soft Tissue Lesions

15.1.2.1

Definition of Complete Response

Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.

15.1.2.2    Definition of Partial Response

At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum of longest diameters of non-lymph node lesions and of the short diameter(s) or 
short axis (SA) of lymph nodes.  

15.1.2.3    Definition of Stable Disease

Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR) nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.

15.1.2.4

Definition of Soft Tissue Progression

At least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.  

NOTE:  The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression, except for 
lymph node and bone lesions as follows.

15.1.2.4.1    Assessment of Soft Tissue Time Point Response
The following table summarizes the RECIST 1.1 response status calculation at each time 
point for patients who have measurable soft tissue disease at baseline.  Note that this 
assessment does not include bone scan assessment and is not the overall assessment of 
radiographic disease status.

15.1.3    Radionuclide Bone Scan Assessment 

15.1.3.1

Baseline Assessment

Bone scan lesions should be enumerated at baseline.  Questionable lesions, eg, sites of 
previous fracture, may require confirmation by CT or MRI.

15.1.3.2

Postbaseline Assessments and Definition of Progression of Bone Metastatic 
Disease Based on Radionuclide Bone Scan

Bone scan lesions should be assessed and enumerated at each follow-up assessment.  

Progression on bone scan is defined as 2 or more new lesions on radionuclide bone scans.  
Should 2 or more new bone lesions be evident at the first assessment on treatment (Cycle 3,
Day 1), 2 or more additional new lesions must be evident on a confirmatory assessment at 
least 6 weeks later (and no sooner than 12 weeks after the start of dosing, per protocol 
scheduled at Cycle 5, Day 1).  This confirmation is not required when 2 or more new lesions 
(compared to baseline or to the Cycle 3, Day 1 assessment) first appear after the first 
follow-up assessment, ie, at Cycle 5, Day 1 or thereafter.  

Should new bone lesions be documented at Cycle 3, Day 1 but not confirmed at Cycle 5,
Day 1, then Cycle 3, Day 1 becomes the new baseline and 2 or more new lesions at
subsequent assessments relative to Cycle 3 Day 1 defines bone scan progression.

Stable disease (SD) on bone scan stable disease is defined as the absence of progression.  
Bone scan lesions are considered non-evaluable under RECIST, and thus there can be no 
partial response.  Complete response is very rare.  Thus, almost all bone scans will be rated 
as NE (no lesions present), SD, or PD.

15.1.4    Overall Response Assessment
The following table summarizes the overall response status calculation at each time point for 
patients who have either RECIST 1.1 evaluable soft tissue lesions and/or radionuclide bone 
scan lesions.  Note that CR can only occur if there are RECIST 1.1-evaluable lesions and no 
bone lesions based on radionuclide bone scan.  PR can occur if patients have CR or PR 
based on soft tissue evaluation and bone scan lesions that are stable.

a Opioid drugs NOT recommended include meperidine, methadone, propoxyphene, partial agonists 
(buprenorphine), and mixed agonist-antagonists (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine).

b Oral morphine equivalent (OME) score is based on an oral morphine dose of 30 mg; the conversion 

factor listed is for chronic dosing.  Avoid using morphine in renal failure.

c Available in transdermal system for extended dosing.  See the calculation below for dose conversion 

from other opioids to transdermal fentanyl.

d Weak opioid receptor agonist with some antidepressant activity; for mild to moderate pain.  

Recommended dose of 100 mg 4 times daily (maximum daily dose of 400 mg) to avoid central nervous 
system toxicity.  At maximum dose, tramadol is less potent than other opioid analgesics.

Oral Morphine Equivalence Conversion Calculation

To calculate the oral morphine equivalent (OME) score of an opioid in Table 15-4:

X  dose of an opioid equivalent to an oral morphine dose of 30 mg
Y  dose of that opioid consumed by the patient in the last 24 hours
OME of that opioid consumed in the last 24 hours  Y / X  30

Example:  A patient consumed 100 mg of oral codeine in the last 24 hours.  The OME 
calculation is:

X  200 mg
Y  100 mg
OME of oral codeine  100 / 200  30  15 mg

15.6    Specific Guidelines for Possible Study Drug-Related Toxicities

15.6.1    Fatigue

Fatigue is defined as a disorder characterized by a state of generalized weakness with a 
pronounced inability to summon sufficient energy to accomplish daily activities.

In the open-label, phase1/2 study (TAK-700_201), patients have experienced fatigue.  Most 
events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  Grade 3 fatigue was experienced by some patients, 
including those who received concomitant prednisone.  Other factors, such as acute 
androgen deprivation, may also be contributing to symptoms.  Prior to dose modification, 
the investigator should confirm that the patient is receiving prednisone 5 mg BID.  Table 
15-6 summarizes the NCI CTCAE criteria (version 4.02)(86) for fatigue and the appropriate 
actions to be followed.

Source:  NCI CTCAE version 4.02.(86)
Abbreviation:  ADL  activity of daily living.

Dose modification for Grade 2 fatigue is optional but may be helpful by slowing the 
induction to full androgen deprivation.  Grade 3 fatigue should be treated according to the 
general outlines in Section 6.3, including initial hold of dosing and re-introduction of study 
drug with subsequent titration at 2-week intervals to the patient’s tolerated dose level.

Note:  It is possible that nausea and vomiting could be secondary to acute adrenal 
insufficiency, eg, caused by sudden cessation of prednisone dosing.  If nausea and vomiting 
occur in the setting of severe fatigue, prostration, or hypotension, blood should be obtained 
to check the electrolytes.  Institutional standard of care should follow in the presence of 
electrolytes imbalance.  Even if the vomiting occurs shortly following the study drug dose, 
no re-dosing of study drug will be done.

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is defined as a disorder characterized by frequent and watery bowel movements.

Dose reduction follows Grade 3 Dose Reduction 
and Dose Re-escalation guidelines (Section 6.3).

Dose reduction follows Grade 4 Dose Reduction 
and Dose Re-escalation guidelines (Section 6.3).

If new onset or worsening of established hypertension occurs and the potassium level is 
< 3.5 mg/dL, in the absence of other causes such as new diuretic therapy, it suggests a study 
drug-related mineralocorticoid syndrome and should be followed by review of the patient’s 
compliance with the prednisone regime.  A plasma renin activity that is undetectable or low 
also suggests such a syndrome rather than a secondary cause.  While addressing either 
underlying factors or compliance with current antihypertensives or prednisone dosing, dose 
modification should be initiated according to the general guidelines outlined in Section 6.3.

If other causes are identified as the reason for new or worsening hypertension, the 
investigator should follow the institution’s local standard of care treatment, and the dose of 
study drug can be adjusted upwards in accordance with the general guidelines, Section 6.3.

15.6.4    Rash (Acneiform or Maculopapular, Localized or Generalized)

Acneiform rash is defined as a disorder characterized by an eruption of papules and pustules, 
typically appearing in face, scalp, upper chest, and back.  Maculo-papular rash is defined as 
a disorder characterized by the presence of macules (flat) and papules (elevated).  Also 
known as morbiliform rash, it is one of the most common cutaneous AEs.

Other types of dermatitis may occur during the study treatment; some of them may require 
dose modification and supportive care.  Please follow the Dose Reduction and Dose 
Re-escalation guidelines (Section 6.3), as well as standard of care for the treatment of 
dermatitis.  For patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, discontinue 
study drug immediately.

For patients who develop a non-localized rash, additional descriptive information will be 
collected, such as the appearance, distribution, extent of skin involvement, and any 
associated symptoms (eg, pruritus).  See Section 7.4.8.  Digital photographs and/or skin 
biopsies may be requested by the sponsor.

15.6.5    Hyperglycemia

Hyperglycemia is a disorder characterized by laboratory test results that indicate an 
elevation in the concentration of blood sugar.  It is usually an indication of diabetes mellitus 
or glucose intolerance.  Androgen deprivation has been associated with new onset of 
diabetes.  Prednisone, at the doses used in this protocol, may also worsen underlying glucose 
tolerance or pre-existing diabetes.  However, because the progression of prostate cancer is of 
immediate importance to the patient, study investigators are encouraged to not modify the 
prednisone or orteronel therapeutic dose regimen unless other adjustments to the antidiabetic 
regimen are unsuccessful or for Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (see Table 15-12).  

If the patient has a medical history of diabetes mellitus (type I or type II), the patient’s 
diabetes should be followed frequently per local standard of care.  A physician experienced 
in the management of diabetes should be involved in the patient’s care.  Patients should be 
counseled for the importance of diet and antidiabetic treatment compliance throughout the 
study; any change in symptoms or home glucose monitoring results should be reviewed at 
each scheduled visit and the patient encouraged to follow up as required with the physician 
managing the patient’s diabetes.  The physician managing the patient’s diabetes should be 
informed that the patient is on or has recently started on prednisone therapy.  Changes in 
diabetic medication should be supervised by or be based on consultation with the physician 
managing the patient’s diabetes.  

At baseline, if the HbA1c is > 7%, the patient should be referred for further assessment to 
ensure adequate or improved diabetes control while on study.  During the study treatment, if 
there is an increase in HgbA1c of 1.5 % above baseline or to > 8.0%, the patient should be 
referred to the physician managing the patient’s diabetes for additional management support.  
The management of hyperglycemia or diabetes should be addressed before considering 
study drug or prednisone dose reduction or hold.  

Worsening of diabetic control is often associated with acute or chronic infection, other acute 
illness, new medication (diuretics or beta blockers), or electrolyte abnormalities 
(hypokalemia).  Assessment for these underlying precipitating factors should always be 
considered in addition to adjusting the diabetes treatment regimen.  

The following guidelines apply to either new onset or previously diagnosed diabetes.

Check HbA1c.  If > 7.0%, make sure that 
the patient is currently under care of a 
physician experienced with management 
of the diabetes and refer the patient to 
that physician for evaluation.  Seek 
precipitating cause(s).  Reassess after 2 
weeks.  No dose modification is required.
Review and assure treatment of 
precipitating causes, including new 
infections or hypokalemia.  Reduce 
prednisone to 5 mg once daily for 2 
weeks, then reassess.  Resume 
prednisone 5 mg BID after improvement 
in blood glucose to Grade ≤ 2.  If blood 
glucose does not improve, hold both 
study drug and prednisone for 2 weeks 
then reassess.  Monitor patient for signs 
and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.  
Both study drug and prednisone 5 mg 
BID may be resumed if blood glucose 
improves to Grade ≤ 2.
Treat precipitating cause (infection or 
other acute illness) concurrently with 
acute diabetic management.  Hold both 
study drug and prednisone for 2 weeks 
then reassess.  Consider corticosteroid 
dosing for coverage of physiologic stress 
if indicated.  Monitor patient for signs 
and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency if 
no corticosteroid administered.  Resume 
study drug and prednisone 5 mg once 
daily if blood glucose improves to Grade 
3.  Both study drug and prednisone 5 mg 
BID may be resumed if blood glucose 
improves to Grade ≤ 2.

15.6.6    Renal Disorders

Acute renal injury is defined as a disorder characterized by the acute loss of renal function 
and is traditionally classified as prerenal (low blood flow into kidney), renal (kidney 
damage), and postrenal causes (ureteral or bladder outflow obstruction).  The toxicity grade 
of acute renal injury will be assessed based on the serum creatinine level.  Other clinical 
signs and symptoms, including proteinuria and hematuria, as detected by qualitative or 
quantitative laboratory test results, may be monitored in addition to creatinine value.  

In studies of patients with advanced prostate cancer, the incidence of worsening renal 
function is relatively common and largely associated with worsening or exacerbation of 
urinary outflow obstruction.  In addition, new use of diuretics or other precipitants of 
volume depletion commonly results in prerenal azotemia.  

Table 15-13 summarizes the CTCAE Criteria (version 4.02(86)) for acute renal disorder and 
the appropriate actions to be followed.

study drug for 2 weeks.  Resume at dose level 
reduced by 1 once creatinine is ≤ 2  baseline.  If 
the event recurs, reduce dose by 1 additional level 
and reassess.  Final dose should be no higher than 
1 level below starting dose.  
Hold study drug until the patient is discharged 
from the hospital and creatinine level has 
recovered to  < 2  baseline and resume at one 
reduced level, then follow Grade 2 guidelines.  
Discontinue orteronel permanently.

15.6.7    Suspected or Possible Adrenal Insufficiency

If patients experience adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal insufficiency will have the more 
nonspecific manifestations of glucocorticoid insufficiency, rather than the more specific 
electrolyte abnormalities of mineralocorticoid insufficiency.  Discontinuing prednisone and 
continuing orteronel while on study may lead to the symptoms of chronic or acute adrenal 
(glucocorticoid) insufficiency.  Patients experiencing severe physiological stress 
(eg, surgery, severe infection) should be carefully monitored for adrenal insufficiency.  
Concomitant medications may complicate the picture of adrenal insufficiency, in particular 
in patients who are on beta-blockers or diuretics.  Concomitant illness such as infection 
might similarly trigger or worsen symptoms of otherwise mild adrenal insufficiency.  

Grading of adrenal insufficiency, the clinical manifestations associated with the specific 
grade, and suggested management options are provided in Table 15-14.  In all cases, 
‘actions’ should include a thorough review for other possible causes or contributors to the 
presenting symptoms (eg, infection, anemia, or newly introduced concomitant medications).

radiographic disease progression, patients will enter the long-term follow-up portion of the study.  Patients may remain on study drug after disease progression 
and return for scheduled visits until they receive subsequent antineoplastic therapy.  
Short-term follow-up is the portion of the study that specifically includes patients who discontinue study drug, but have not yet experienced radiographic 
disease progression.  After radiographic disease progression, patients will then enter the long-term follow-up portion of the study.
Long-term follow-up is the portion of the study when patients will no longer have scheduled visits or assessments, but are followed for alternative 
antineoplastic therapies and survival.





b Screening assessments must begin within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.  All screening laboratory tests, including PSA, must be performed at the central 

laboratory.

c Patients continuing study drug following disease progression should continue to have these study assessments performed according to this schedule until treatment 

with study drug is discontinued.  Testing for each cycle from Cycle 1 through Cycle 7 will be completed every 28 days on Day 1 of the cycle ( 3 days).  After 
Cycle 7, Day 1 testing will be performed every 3 cycles (every 84 days  5 days).

d Frequency of assessment is based on Cycle 13 as the starting point, eg, Q3C assessments would occur at the beginning of Cycles 16, 19, etc.
e Recording of vital signs and completion of the BPI-SF and EQ-5D questionnaires are required at unscheduled visits.  Other assessments should be done as

i A complete physical examination must be conducted at the screening and EOT visits.  At all other visits, physical exams may be symptom/disease directed.
j Vital sign measurements include diastolic and systolic BP, heart rate, and temperature.  Blood pressure will be taken after the patient has been in a seated position 

for 5 minutes.  At screening, patients may have 2 BP measurements taken no more than 60 minutes apart to exclude uncontrolled hypertension.  For eligible 
patients, only the BP measurement that confirms eligibility should be recorded on the eCRF.

k MUGA scans or ECHO; the same modality should be used for a patient throughout the study and the assessments should be performed at the same institution 

whenever possible.

Cycle 1, Day 1:  1 sample obtained 1 to 2 hours postdose.
Cycle 2:  2 samples are to be obtained during the clinic visit with the second sample obtained at least 2 hours after the first.
Cycle 4:  1 sample obtained during the clinic visit.

o CTC enumeration and biomarker samples (8.5 mL) must be collected and shipped to the vendor’s laboratory at ambient temperature on the same day.  
p CTC biomarker samples will be obtained from approximately 300 patients enrolled in selected countries.
q Germline genetic testing is optional for patients.
r Radiographic evaluation will be performed at screening; at Cycles 3, 5, and 7; and then every 3 cycles until disease progression; additional scans should be 

performed at the physician’s discretion if progression is suspected.  Testing will include CT with intravenous contrast or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.   
The imaging modality should remain consistent throughout the study.  Patients who experience radiographic disease progression and continue to receive study drug 
are not required to undergo radiographic assessments; however, subsequent radiographic assessments may be performed as clinically indicated.  

s Bone scanning will be performed at screening; at Cycles 3, 5, and 7; and every 3 cycles thereafter.  Requirements for additional scans to confirm progression are 
defined in the STUDY DEFINITIONS.  Patients who experience radiographic disease progression and continue on study drug will have radiographic assessments 
performed as clinically indicated.

Clinical Study Protocol C21005 Amendment 9

15.8    Rationale and Purposes for Amendment 1

Rationale for Amendment 1 (Argentina-specific amendment relative to the original 
protocol)

The primary purpose of this amendment is to clarify the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
patient assessments based on recommendations made by the Administración Nacional de 
Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnología Médica (ANMAT).  The recommendations for the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria from ANMAT included restricting the confirmation of 
prostate cancer by histologic, not cytologic, methods and increasing the minimum calculated 
creatinine clearance for patients who might have renal insufficiency.  The screening 
procedures were revised to include cranial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) procedures to ensure that patients with metastases to the central 
nervous system (CNS) are excluded, and serologic testing of patients who have not been 
tested previously for infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B 
or C.
Purposes for Amendment 1

The purposes of this amendment are to:

 Clarify that prostate cancer will be confirmed histologically

 Add cranial CT or MRI procedures at screening to exclude patients with CNS 

Increase the minimum calculated creatinine clearance from 40 mL/min to 60 mL/min

metastases

 Add serologic testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C to the screening procedures for 
those patients who are at high risk and have not been previously tested or if testing is 
required by the institutional review board or ethics committee 

 Add criteria for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and disease progression as reasons 

for discontinuing study treatment

 Remove definition of disease progression that does not apply to the study population 
 Clarify the data collection timing in the Schedules of Events
 Update the contact information for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs)
 Correct typographical errors, punctuation, grammar, and formatting

15.9    Rationale and Purposes for Amendment 2

Rationale for Amendment 2 (global amendment relative the original protocol)

The primary purpose of this amendment is to refine the eligibility criteria.  This amendment 
also clarifies specific study procedures, updates the safety information for orteronel, adds 
the collection of data on rashes, clarifies the disease assessment guidelines, and adds another 
interim analysis.  
The eligibility criteria have been refined to eliminate the washout period of prior 
antiandrogen therapy since any recent prior therapy with these agents would have already 
failed.  The minimum exposure to prior docetaxel has been reduced to ≥ 360 mg/m2 received 
within a 6-month period for patients who tolerated docetaxel and ≥ 225 mg/m2 received 
within a 6-month period for those patients experiencing prostate cancer progression while 
receiving docetaxel or were intolerant of docetaxel.  The reduction in the minimum 
cumulative docetaxel dose will accommodate regional or local guidelines or practices for 
docetaxel administration and will allow enrollment of otherwise eligible patients in this 
global study.  
Prior therapy with other therapies for prostate cancer, other than gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone GnRH analogues, such as progesterone, medroxyprogesterone, progestins 
(megesterol), or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride or dutasteride) must be 
discontinued 2 weeks before first dose of study drug.  Patients with disease localized to the 
prostate or adjacent tissue are excluded, ie patients must have regional or distant metastases.  
Some study samples have been clarified, refined, or expanded.  The serologic testing for 
patients who are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C 
and have not been previously tested may be done at screening.  The number and timing of 
the pharmacokinetic (PK) samples have been expanded so that data are collected at 
sufficient sparse time points to permit population PK modeling.  
The rationale, collection, and labeling of samples for the germline and tumor DNA analyses 
have been refined to ensure that investigators and patients understand which assessments are 
optional and that the samples will be labeled and handled according to regional and local 
regulations with removal of patient identifiers from these samples.  
The disease assessments for this study are based on the guidelines from the Prostate Cancer 
Working Group (PCWG2) that incorporate evaluation of soft tissue lesions according to the 
Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.  The assessment guidelines 
provided in the protocol have been revised for clarity.  Other clarifications in procedures are 
summarized below.  
An additional interim analysis to occur at approximately 50% of the total events will permit 
an earlier assessment of the treatment effect.  The alpha spending function used to control 
the overall type I error remained unchanged.

15.10    Rationale and Purposes for Amendment 3

Rationale for Amendment 3 (Peru-specific amendment relative to the original 
protocol)
The primary purpose of this amendment is to revise the eligibility criteria based on 
recommendations made by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS).  The guidelines from the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network state that cabazitaxel is considered a first line 
treatment for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have failed 
treatment with docetaxel plus prednisone.  Additionally, according to the International 
Council on Harmonization guidelines, possible benefits, risks, costs, and efficacy of every 
new intervention must be evaluated through their comparison with best existing proven 
intervention, as well as with its exceptions.  As a result, the inclusion criteria were revised to 
include those patients who have had prior treatment with cabazitaxel when available.  The 
dose and timeframe for prior docetaxel therapy is also specified.
Purposes for Amendment 3
The purposes of this amendment are to:

 Revise the minimum prior exposure of docetaxel received within a 6-month period 

for patients with progressive disease

 Revise the eligibility criteria to include progressive disease during or following 1 or

2 regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy

15.12    Rationale and Purposes for Amendment 5

Rationale for Amendment 5 (relative to global amendment 2)

The primary purpose of this amendment is to increase the period of contraception to be 
followed by patients after the last dose of study drug from 30 days to 4 months.  The 
extension of the contraception period is a precaution based on in vitro results of genotoxicity 
testing of a degradant in the TAK-700 tablet.  Although the degradant was negative for 
mutagenic structural alerts in the in silico assessments, the degradant tested positive for 
mutagenicity in 1 of 5 bacterial strains tested in the Ames assay, and it induced structural 
and numerical chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay.  The 
potential clinical implications of these in vitro assay results are that any resulting genetic or 
chromosomal change could potentially lead to secondary tumors and may pose a risk to an 
unborn child.
Given the potential benefit of TAK-700 to patients with progressive castrate resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) for whom alternative treatments and life expectancy are limited, the 
anticipated risk of the degradant is considered to be low.  To minimize potential risks to an 
unborn child, the requirement for the use of barrier contraception or abstention from 
heterosexual intercourse has been extended to 4 months after the last dose of study drug.  
The risk language for the study drug was updated to include the reference to potential 
clinical implications of the possible genotoxic degradant in the drug product.
Purposes for Amendment 5

The purposes of this amendment are to:

 Align the period of exclusion of prior radiotherapy in the Protocol Summary with 

Exclusion Criterion 4

 Remove reference to the 1-hour time window for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 

(DHEA-S), testosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and

Purpose:  Add background information on enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate to the 
study rationale

The primary change occurs in Section 1.4, Study Rationale:

Added 
text:

Abiraterone acetate, an irreversible steroidal CYP enzyme 17 (CYP17) 
inhibitor of both the 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities approved 
for patients with mCRPC who have received prior docetaxel, prolonged 
overall survival (OS) in patients with mCRPC who had previously 
received docetaxel chemotherapy.(43, 44)  Furthermore, abiraterone 
acetate showed improvement in progression-free survival and a trend in 
OS in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients.(45)  However, toxicities 
attributed to a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess have 
been noted with abiraterone and require administration of a 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or glucocorticoid to suppress 
ACTH.(29)  Enzalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor, was recently 
approved in the US for treatment of mCRPC in docetaxel-treated 
patients after showing improvement in OS compared with placebo in  
patients with mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel 
chemotherapy.(46, 47)

Purpose:  Update the risk language of orteronel, per the most recent IB data cutoff date, 
29 September 2012

The primary change occurs in Section 1.5.3, Potential Risks:

Formerly 
read:

Due to its mechanism of action, orteronel treatment may elicit expression of
adverse events typically associated with androgen deprivation therapy 
(decreased bone mineral density, hyperglycemia, and prolonged QTc 
interval).  Other potential risks include decreased left ventricular ejection 
fraction, increased serum amylase and/or lipase, or adrenal insufficiency.  See 
the IB for detailed safety information.

Purpose:  Update the risk language for T-1358043 (a process impurity, drug product 
degradant, and minor metabolite of orteronel) based on nonclinical studies

The primary change occurs in Section 1.5.3, Potential Risks:

Formerly 
read:

A degradant in the TAK 700 tablet tested positive for genotoxicity in in vitro
tests and could potentially pose a risk to human subjects.  The potential 
clinical implications of these in vitro results are that any resulting genetic or 
chromosomal change could potentially lead to secondary malignancy and
may pose a risk to an unborn child.

Purpose:  Update language on the procedures for product complaints and medication 
errors during the study

The primary change occurs in Section 11.11, Product Complaints:

Deleted 
text:

A medication error is a preventable event that involves an identifiable patient 
and that leads to inappropriate medication use, which may result in patient 
harm.  While overdoses and underdoses constitute medication errors, doses 
missed inadvertently by a patient do not.  Individuals who identify a potential 
medication error situation should immediately contact MedComm Solutions 
(see below) and report the event.

For Product Complaints or Medication Errors,

call MedComm Solutions at

(US and International)

Product complaints and medication errors in and of themselves are not AEs.  
If a product complaint or medication error results in an SAE, an SAE form 
should be completed and sent to PPD (refer to Section 10.2).
