Study objectives 

Objective 
5.  To collect optional 
prostate cancer tissue 
(eg, from TURP or 
biopsies) from 
consenting patients and 
store for further 
investigation 
6.  To collect an 
optional 
pharmacogenetics 
sample from consenting 
patients and store for 
further investigation 
 

Outcome variable 
Available tumour specimens may be collected for exploratory biomarker 
research.  Future analysis may aim to determine the effect of biomarkers on 
clinical outcomes and response to study treatments versus placebo 

A blood sample may be collected to study polymorphisms in the genes 
involved in the response to ZD4054. Any genotyping would investigate 
genes believed to be involved in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
elimination or mode of action of ZD4054 and any comparators, its related 
pathway and other oncogenic pathways 

Study design 
This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-centre, 2-arm, placebo-controlled 
Phase III study assessing the efficacy and safety of 10 mg ZD4054 in comparison with 
placebo in patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.  The 1:1 
randomisation will be stratified by centre, and patients will be randomised to either ZD4054 or 
placebo; both may be given in addition to standard/palliative care for metastatic prostate 
cancer. 

Patients may receive prostate cancer therapies in the form of: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Regular follow-up 

Bisphosphonates 

Symptomatic therapy for pain control (excluding opiates) or urinary obstruction 

Castration therapy either surgical or medical, including luteinising hormone-
releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa), megace, estradiol. 

In addition, patients could receive other therapies including prednisolone, estramustine, 
ketoconazole at investigator’s discretion without being considered treatment failures or having 
to stop ZD4054 or placebo therapy.  Chemotherapy may also be administered in addition to 
trial therapy at investigator discretion if the patient is considered likely to derive benefit; 
though it should be noted that experience with ZD4054 in combination with chemotherapy is 
limited at the time of initiation of this study. 

The following treatments are excluded from the allowed standard/palliative care:

Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

• 

Any other experimental agent. 

Target patient population 
A total number of 580 hormone-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis who 
are pain free or mildly symptomatic who have rising serum prostate-specific antigen levels 
despite medical or surgical castration. 

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration 
Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive 10 mg ZD4054, or placebo, given orally once daily 
in tablet form. 

Comparator, dosage and mode of administration 
Matched placebo given orally once daily in tablet form. 

Duration of treatment 
Patients will continue on randomised study treatment until a discontinuation criterion is met.  
Data cut-off will be declared when 263 deaths have occurred.  After this point only SAE data 
for patients continuing treatment will be collected. 

Statistical methods 
A total of 580 patients will be recruited into this study. 

The formal analysis will be performed when 263 deaths have occurred.  Based on a 
recruitment period of 18 months and a median overall survival (OS) for the placebo group of 
approximately 19 months, it is estimated that 263 deaths will occur approximately 30 months 
after the first patient entered the study.  If the true hazard ratio for ZD4054 versus placebo is 
0.67, then the analysis will have 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant effect in 
overall survival at the 5% significance level. 

One interim analysis is planned for this study and will occur when at least 50% of the death 
events have been reached.  Using the O’Brien-Fleming stopping rule, the level of significance 
for the interim analysis is 0.005, and the level of significance for the final analysis is 0.048.  

The OS and progression free survival (PFS) will be analysed using a log-rank test.  The effect 
of ZD4054 relative to placebo will be estimated by hazard ratios and confidence intervals. 

A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalised before unblinding of the 
data.  Analyses will be performed using SAS and other validated software as appropriate. 

Where data are missing, the impact and scale will be investigated.  Where a baseline variable 
is missing, it may be possible to substitute the value recorded at a different pre-treatment visit.  
This would be considered for each variable independently and a decision on the strategy to 
deal with each variable being missing will be documented in the SAP prior to database lock.

Summaries of the safety and efficacy data will be produced using graphs and standard 
summary statistics.  For continuous variables, these statistics will include (but not be limited 
to) the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.  For categorical data, 
these statistics will consist of frequencies and associated percentages.  Missing safety and 
efficacy data will not be included in the numerator of the percentage calculation. 

Measures of location (mean, median, minimum and maximum) will be reported to the same 
degree of precision as the raw data.  Measures of spread (standard deviation, standard error) 
will be reported to one further degree of precision.  Where confidence intervals are provided, 
unless otherwise stated, they will have been calculated using an assumption of normal 
distribution. 

Pharmacokinetic analysis will be carried out by, or under the guidance of, Clinical 
Pharmacology UK, AstraZeneca.

Background 

1.1 
The main purpose of this study is to assess the effect of ZD4054 on overall survival compared 
with placebo, both given on a background of standard/palliative prostate cancer management, 
in men with hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has metastasised to bone.  Information 
about the pre-clinical and clinical studies to date for ZD4054 is covered in detail in the 
Investigator Brochure (IB).  The IB is intended to facilitate the investigator’s understanding of 
the compound for clinical studies in which the product is administered. 

Prostate cancer 

1.1.1 
ZD4054, a specific endothelin receptor-A (ETA) antagonist, is currently being developed as a 
potential treatment for hormone-resistant prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer is a leading cause of 
cancer death worldwide, being the second and third leading cause of cancer death in men in 
the United Kingdom and United States, respectively (Cancer Research UK, American Cancer 
Society).  Bone metastases will develop in the majority of men with advanced prostate cancer 
and are a major cause for the morbidity associated with advanced prostate cancer.  Initial 
treatment of advanced disease is via suppression of testicular androgen production, either 
alone or in combination with an anti-androgen but nearly all men with metastases will 
eventually experience disease progression despite this treatment (Harris and Reese 2001).  
Patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer have a poor prognosis. 

Endothelin and endothelin receptors 

1.1.2 
Three endothelin isoforms have been characterised (ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3), and 2 receptors 
(ETA and ETB).  ET-1, originally identified as a potent vasoconstrictor, has been implicated in 
various aspects of tumour progression, including proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis 
(Dawas et al 1999), bone remodelling in metastatic disease (Kozawa et al 2000), and 
modification of tumour blood flow (Chaplin et al 1998).  The predominant actions of ET-1 
appear to be mediated via the ETA receptor (Levin 1995).  There is also evidence suggesting 
that the ETA receptor is involved in mediating nociceptive effects associated with ET-1 and in 
stimulating proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts.  ETA receptor blockade reduces the 
formation of bone metastases in vivo.  There has been particular interest in the role of ET-1 in 
prostate cancer (reviewed by Nelson and Carducci 2000).  Elevated levels of circulating ET-1 
have been found in men with metastatic prostate cancer, as has over-expression of the ETA 
receptor in prostate cancer cells and down-regulation of the ETB receptor, which is thought to 
induce cell apoptosis and acts as a clearance mechanism for plasma ET-1 (Fukuroda et al 
1994).  The ideal profile proposed for an endothelin antagonist for use in the treatment of 
prostate cancer is a specific ETA receptor antagonist that has no inhibitory activity at the ETB 
receptor.  This should block the cell proliferation and survival signals mediated by ETA 
receptor, while allowing the beneficial ETB receptor mediated tumour cell apoptosis and ET-1 
clearance.

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

Previous clinical experience 

1.1.3 
Study 4054IL/0006 (D4320C00006) was a Phase II study in 312 men with asymptomatic or 
mildly symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer, that compared 2 doses of ZD4054 versus best 
supportive care in men with metastatic prostate cancer that had metastasised to bone.  At a 
data cut of 28 February 2007, based on 118 deaths in the intention to treat population, both the 
10 mg and 15 mg doses of ZD4054 showed some improvement in overall survival when 
compared to placebo (ZD4054 15 mg HR=0.65, 80%CI=( 0.49 to 0.86), p= 0.051 and ZD4054 
10 mg HR=0.55, 80%CI=( 0.41 to 0.73), p= 0.008). 
1.2 
This study will be conducted in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic prostate 
cancer that has metastasised to bone, with or without visceral metastasis.  Patients in both the 
10 mg and 15 mg dose arms in the Phase II study (4054IL/0006) showed improved survival 
compared with the placebo-treated patients.  However, these results are based on a secondary 
endpoint and relatively small absolute patient numbers, and thus need to be confirmed in a 
larger-scale Phase III study which will also allow better assessment of safety and tolerability. 
In study 4054IL/0006 there was no increase in efficacy with the 15 mg dose, and the 
tolerability profile looks similar for the 10 mg and the 15 mg dose, therefore the 10 mg, rather 
than the 15 mg, dose was chosen to proceed into Phase III. 

Rationale 

Although docetaxel is approved for use in this patient population, the 2 pivotal studies used to 
register docetaxel do not specifically address when to begin therapy (Tannock et al 2004, 
Petrylak et al 2004).  The patients in these studies included men with and without bone pain 
secondary to metastasis, and no distinction was made for the benefit of docetaxel therapy in 
either cohort of men.  The optimal time to begin docetaxel therapy is therefore not defined.  
Thus appropriate treatment for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic men with metastasis 
can be a policy of expectant management, with initiation of aggressive agents in particular 
chemotherapy such as docetaxel, only on development of symptoms.  Only men with 
metastatic prostate cancer who have either no or relatively minimal symptoms will be entered 
into this study.  Due to the specific patient population chosen for this study, the comparator to 
ZD4054 will be placebo.  Men must have metastases to bone (with or without visceral 
metastases), because this was the patient population evaluated in study 4054IL/0006 
(D4320C00006) and there is some evidence from the atrasentan (another endothelin receptor 
antagonist in development) program that men with soft tissue metastases only do not benefit 
from endothelin antagonist therapy. 

The primary endpoint for this study is overall survival.  Progression free survival is a 
secondary endpoint defined using clinical endpoints in addition to the standard radiologic 
definitions (see Table 1).  The most common site of metastasis in HRPC is to bone, which 
often has significant symptomatic sequelae, such as severe pain or pathologic fractures.  
Therefore, increasing PFS for the development of metastasis in these men will have a clear 
clinical benefit.   

The provision of a serum sample for exploratory biomarker work provides an opportunity to 
investigate as yet unidentified serum biomarkers that correlate to parameters such as response

STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 

Overall study design and flow chart 

3.1 
This Clinical Study Protocol has been subjected to a peer review according to AstraZeneca 
standard procedures. 

This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-centre, 2-arm, placebo-controlled 
Phase III study assessing the efficacy and safety of 10 mg ZD4054 in comparison with 
placebo in patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastasis.  1:1 
randomisation will be stratified by centre and patients will be randomised to either ZD4054 or 
placebo.  In addition to trial therapy patients may receive standard supportive/palliative 
treatment for prostate cancer which may include any of the following: regular follow-up; 
bisphosphonates; symptomatic therapy for pain control (excluding opiates until disease 
progression) or urinary obstruction and castration therapy either surgical or medical, including 
luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa), megace and estradiol.  In addition 
patients could receive other therapies for progressive disease including prednisolone, 
estramustine, ketoconazole at investigators discretion without being considered treatment 
failures or having to stop ZD4054 or placebo therapy.  Chemotherapy may also be 
administered in addition to trial therapy at investigator discretion if the patient is considered 
likely to derive benefit; though it should be noted that experience with ZD4054 in 
combination with chemotherapy is limited at  the time of initiation of this study.  Any other 
experimental agents are excluded from the allowed standard/palliative care.  Approximately 
580 patients with prostate cancer and who have bone metastases who have rising serum PSA 
levels despite medical or surgical castration will be recruited.  They will be recruited into 
approximately 150 hospital-based centres globally.

Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

Patients will receive 10 mg ZD4054 or placebo (see Section 3.4) until a discontinuation 
criterion is met. 

The formal analysis is planned for when 263 deaths have occurred.  Once 263 deaths have 
occurred, any patient who continues on treatment post data cut-off will only continue to have 
SAE data collected.  An interim analysis will be conducted when at least 50% of deaths have 
occurred. 

Patients will attend study visits and have assessments performed according to the schedule 
detailed in the Study Plan Table 2.  Patients will be seen every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks; 
thereafter patients will attend for study visits every 12 weeks, although additional visits may 
be scheduled if clinically indicated.  All patients will undergo a bone scan and CT or MRI 
scan of the abdomen and pelvis (and chest if clinically indicated) at entry, at withdrawal of 
trial therapy and as clinically indicated between these times. 

Patients will continue to take trial therapy until a withdrawal criterion is met.  A rise in PSA 
alone is not a discontinuation criterion. If discontinuation of trial therapy is felt to be in the 
best interests of the patient, a bone scan and CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (and chest 
if clinically indicated) will be required at that point.  These patients will continue to be 
followed up for survival and other trial endpoints.   

Following clinical progression, patients should be managed according to investigators’ 
discretion; it is expected that docetaxel as an approved therapy will be used if clinically 
indicated. 

Serum biomarker samples and genetic samples will be obtained from consenting patients and 
stored for long-term experimental purposes. 

Adverse events will be collected throughout the study (see Section 4.6).  There will be an 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) responsible for the review of safety and 
efficacy data on an ongoing basis, as detailed in Appendix O. 

A study flow chart is provided in Figure 1.

Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

Baseline assessments must be carried out before administration of first dose of study treatment, except where specifically indicated. 
Visits must occur within +/- 3 days of the scheduled date for the 4 weekly visits and +/-2 weeks of the scheduled date for the 12-weekly visits 
Informed consent is to be obtained within 6 weeks before randomisation 
12 Lead ECGs (2 identical copies at each time point) obtained in accordance with Section 4.6.4 
Patients continuing on study drug after 263 deaths have occurred will be followed for SAE data only 
Clinical Chemistry and haematology to establish eligibility are to be performed a maximum of 4 weeks prior to randomisation by the central laboratory.. 
BNP to be performed at baseline and then every following visit, however the utility of BNP data will be reviewed and if not found to be predictive of 
development of cardiac failure it will cease to be performed. 
All PSA measurements will be performed by the central laboratory. 
A bone scan to confirm eligibility is to be performed a maximum of 4 weeks prior to randomisation.  Further bone scans will be performed as clinically 
indicated and at discontinuation of trial therapy.  Whole body anteroposterior (AP) and posteroanterior (PA) bone scans should be performed.  See 
Appendix K 
Tumour assessment by CT/MRI to be performed a maximum of 4 weeks prior to randomisation. Further CT/MRI scans will be performed as clinically 
indicated and at discontinuation. CT or MRI Scans performed will be expected to cover pelvis and abdomen. Additional regions eg, chest should be 
included where clinically indicated for soft tissue lesions at baseline and follow-up eg, pulmonary metastases. Any other sites at which new disease or 
worsening symptoms is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.

Rationale and risk/benefit assessment  
Rationale for study design, doses and control groups 

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 
3.2 
3.2.1 
This Phase III study will be randomised and blinded to minimise potential bias between the 
2 different treatment arms.  This study is required to confirm the survival benefit seen in the 
placebo-controlled Phase II study (4054IL/0006 (D4320C00006)).  It needs to be placebo-
controlled in order to replicate as closely the Phase II study but on a larger scale, though 
patients are able to receive trial therapy on top of other supportive/palliative therapies deemed 
necessary for their disease.  This study will also provide additional safety/ tolerability 
information to support use of the drug in normal clinical practice.   

The dose of 10 mg daily of ZD4054 used in this study is derived from analysis of several 
previous studies of ZD4054 to determine safety and efficacy.  This dose was well tolerated by 
patients in previous studies; it was the lowest dose shown to be clinically effective in study 
4054IL/0006 (D4320C00006) and also effectively antagonised infused endothelin in the study 
of forearm blood flow (study 4054IL/0002 (D4320C00002)).  Doses below 10 mg daily have 
not been studied in terms of clinical endpoints as these doses are considered to be suboptimal 
in terms of antagonising endothelin receptors. 

Risk/benefit and ethical assessment 

3.2.2 
Although docetaxel is widely approved to manage this population of patients, it must be noted 
that this is a chemotherapy regime with its attendant toxicity issues.  There remains 
controversy over the appropriate time to initiate docetaxel, delaying chemotherapy until 
symptomatic disease develops is considered a reasonable option (Joly and Tannock 2004; 
Ryan and Eisenberger 2005).  In a relatively asymptomatic patient population, as is proposed 
in this study, an initial approach limited to careful observation with appropriate supportive 
measures, represents an appropriate standard of care and is in line with the European 
Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on Prostate Cancer (EAU Guidelines) and National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (NCCN Guidelines).  With this 
approach, patients with symptomatic progression are still able to benefit from chemotherapy 
in a setting where the risks and toxicities of chemotherapy are better balanced against its 
modest benefits.   

ZD4054 has been studied in a number of clinical studies to date with over 200 patients being 
exposed to drug in the Phase II setting.  The maximum well-tolerated dose on multiple dosing 
is 15 mg daily.  The dose in this trial is below this at 10 mg.  The most common adverse 
effects, principally headache, rhinitis, oedema reflect the pharmacology of the drug and are 
manageable and considered tolerable rather than significant safety concerns.  An increased 
reporting of cardiac failure was seen compared with placebo in previous studies, this was also 
reported with another endothelin receptor antagonist, atrasentan.  The reported incidence of 
cardiac failure as an adverse event is low at approximately 5%. 

Given the potential to improve survival in men with metastatic prostate cancer without the 
toxicity associated with chemotherapy, the benefits of studying ZD4054 are considered to 
outweigh the risks involved.  Furthermore, it is considered appropriate to study ZD4054 in

The patient has undergone a previous bone marrow transplant 

The patient has undergone a whole blood transfusion in the preceding 90 days. 

Restrictions 
Patients taking bisphosphonates must be on a stabilized dose for 4 weeks or more 
prior to starting study treatment, and must remain on the same dose whilst taking 
part in the study.  Bisphosphonate therapy, if infused, must be administered at least 
1 week before bone scans are performed 

Medically castrated patients must remain on castration therapy throughout the 
study, and must have been on stable treatment for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to 
starting study treatment.  The castration therapy dose must also remain stable during 
the study 

Avoid pro-creative sex from receiving the first dose of ZD4054 until 4 months after 
receiving the last dose of ZD4054.  All patients, if sexually active and not surgically 
sterile, should practice reliable methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy (eg, 
spermicidal foam and condoms) during the study 

Discontinuation of patients from treatment or assessment 

3.3.5 
3.3.5.1  Criteria for discontinuation 
Patients may be discontinued from study treatment and assessments at any time.  All patients 
will be followed up for survival unless they withdraw their consent.   

Specific reasons for discontinuing a patient from study treatment are: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Voluntary discontinuation by the patient who is at any time free to discontinue 
their participation in the study, without prejudice to further treatment 

Safety reasons as judged by the investigator and/or AstraZeneca 

Severe non-compliance to protocol as judged by the investigator and/or 
AstraZeneca 

Patient lost to follow-up. 

Specific reasons which may result in discontinuing a patient from study treatment are: 

• 

Incorrect enrolment.  Patients who are found not to meet the required 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study must be discussed with the AstraZeneca 
study team physician.  Each case will be reviewed individually and a decision 
made as to whether the patients must be discontinued

Disease progression.  Investigators should consider alternative therapies in 
patients who progress on trial therapy; however blinded trial therapy may be 
continued at investigator discretion in patients who commence alternative prostate 
cancer therapies.   

A rise in PSA alone is not a discontinuation criterion.  If trial therapy is discontinued, a bone 
scan and CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (and chest if clinically indicated) will be 
required at that point as per the trial plan and patient should continue to be assessed for 
survival and other trial assessments. 

3.3.5.2  Procedures for discontinuation 
Patients who discontinue should always be asked about the reason(s) for their discontinuation 
and the presence of any adverse events.  If possible, they should be seen and assessed by an 
investigator(s).  Adverse events should be followed up and investigational products should be 
returned by the patient. 

If study treatment is stopped during the study, the Principal Investigator/Sub-investigator 
should perform the best possible observation(s), test(s) and evaluation(s) as well as give 
appropriate treatment and all possible measures for the safety of the patient.  In addition, they 
will record on the eCRF the date of withdrawal, the reasons, and treatment at the time of 
withdrawal and also course, treatment and outcome after withdrawal.  They will also 
immediately inform ICON of the withdrawal.  Any serious adverse events should be 
communicated to ICON within the usual timelines. 

All patients who have any CTCAE grade 3 or 4 laboratory values at the time of withdrawal 
should have further tests performed and the results recorded on the appropriate eCRF until the 
laboratory values have returned to CTCAE grade 1 or 2, unless these values are not likely to 
improve because of the underlying disease.   

At discontinuation, all on-going study-related toxicities and SAEs must be followed until 
resolution, unless in the Investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the 
patient’s underlying disease. 

3.3.5.3  Procedures for handling incorrect enrolled patients 
Patients not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria for a study should, under no 
circumstances, be enrolled into the study - there can be no exceptions to this rule.  The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria must be strictly adhered to (see Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3).  If 
any patient is found to have been entered into the study in violation of the selection criteria, 
this must be discussed with the Study Team Physician, who will make a decision regarding 
whether the patient should continue in this study.  This must be documented in detail by the 
Study Team Physician, and by the investigator in the patient’s medical notes.

3.3.5.4  Procedures for discontinuation from genetic aspects of the study 
Patients who discontinue from the study should always be asked specifically whether they are 
withdrawing or continuing their consent for this genetic research.  It must be established 
whether the patient: 

• 

• 

Agrees to the genetic sample and any DNA extracted from the sample being kept 
for genetic research in the future. 

Withdraws consent for the sample to be kept for genetic research in the future and 
wishes the sample to be destroyed.  Destruction of the sample (or the DNA 
extracted from the sample) will only be possible so long as the particular sample is 
traceable.  In the event that genetic research has already been performed, 
AstraZeneca will retain the results and associated data for regulatory reasons but 
these will not be used in any subsequent analyses. 

The principal investigator is responsible for providing written notification to AstraZeneca of 
any patient who has withdrawn consent for the use of the sample taken for genetic research.  
AstraZeneca will provide written confirmation to the investigator of the actions taken with the 
sample, which must be filed in the investigator study file.

• 

A space for the centre number, patient number and date of dispensing, which is to 
be completed at the time of dispensing. 

The label will also contain a tear-off portion with space for the centre number and patient 
number to be completed.  Information from the label will be transcribed on to the eCRF at 
dispensing.  The investigator (or their delegate) must verify the bottle number to ensure that 
each patient is given the correct study medication. 

The investigational product will be supplied as bulk supply.  Investigational site dispensary 
staff will dispense the investigational product as prescribed by the investigator. 

Storage 

3.4.4 
All investigational products must be kept in a secure place under appropriate storage 
conditions.  A description of the appropriate storage and shipment conditions are specified on 
the investigational product label and investigator brochure. 

Accountability 

3.4.5 
The study treatment(s) must be used only as directed in the protocol.  Records of overall 
dispensing and returns will be maintained by each centre.  Treatment dispensed will be 
recorded on the eCRF. 

It is the investigator’s responsibility to maintain accurate records, so that at the end of the 
study it is possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage and destroyed/returned 
stock.  This record keeping consists of a dispensing record including the identification of the 
patient to whom the study treatment was dispensed, the quantity and date of dispensing and 
any unused study drug returned to the investigator.  This record is in addition to any drug 
accountability information recorded on the eCRF. 

Patients must return all unused medication and empty containers to the investigator, who will 
retain these until they are collected by ICON authorised personnel, together with any study 
treatment not dispensed.  In the case that any study drug is damaged please contact ICON 
authorised personnel for reconciliation and replacement. 

At the termination of the study or at the request of the sponsor, unused drug should be 
destroyed locally at the study sites where the capability exists.  If this is not possible the drug 
should be returned to the local distribution centre after the ICON monitor has performed drug 
reconciliation. 

Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) 

3.5 
An interactive voice response system (IVRS) (ICOPhone) will be used for site activation, 
patient registration, study medication assignment, verification of dispensed study drug, 
allocation of patient numbers as patients are randomised, treatment replacement, confirmation 
of study drug shipments to both sites and depots and emergency code breaks.  The system is 
accessible by telephone 24 hours per day, 7 days per week via a toll free number.  Each site 
will be provided with an IVRS manual containing full instructions on its use.

Method of assigning patients to treatment groups 

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 
3.6 
As patients are screened for the study, they must be allocated an E-code.  This number is the 
patient’s unique identifier and is used to identify the patient on the eCRF.  For this study 
IVRS (ICOPhone) will be used to enrol patients.  When a patient is entered into screening the 
Investigator should contact the Centralised Registration/Randomisation Centre by telephone to 
register the patient.  Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to ZD4054 or matched placebo 
stratified by centre.  All screened patients are assigned an E-code irrespective of whether or 
not they are subsequently randomised to receive study treatment. 

If a patient discontinues from the study after randomisation, the patient E-code number will 
not be re-used, and the patient will not be allowed to re-enter the study.  If a patient fails 
screening, the E-code will not be re-used.  If the patient is re-screened, a new E-code will be 
assigned. 

Patient eligibility will be established before treatment randomisation.  Patients will be 
randomised strictly sequentially, as patients are eligible for randomisation.  Once the 
eligibility of a patient has been confirmed, the Investigator should contact the Centralised 
Registration/Randomisation Centre by telephone for the issue of a patient randomisation code 
and allocation of randomised therapy.  Patients will be identified to the Centralised 
Registration/Randomisation Centre using patient initials, E-code and date of birth.  The 
Centralised Registration/Randomisation Centre will inform the Investigator of the patient 
randomisation number and treatment to be allocated. 

At each dispensing visit the medication identification number must be checked to ensure that 
it matches the number allocated by IVRS, prior to treatment dispensation.  If a treatment is 
incorrectly dispensed (eg, medication identification number does not match the number 
allocated by IVRS), the error should be rectified and ICON should be notified as soon as the 
error is discovered. 

The inclusion and exclusion criteria must be strictly adhered to (see Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3).  
If any patient is found to have been entered into the study in violation of the selection criteria, 
this must be discussed with the Study Team Physician, who will make a decision regarding 
whether the patient should continue in this study.  This must be documented in detail by the 
Study Team Physician, and by the investigator in the patient’s medical notes. 

The actual treatment given to individual patients will be determined by a randomisation 
scheme.  The Biostatistics group at AstraZeneca will generate the randomisation schedule, 
which will be stratified by centre.  The randomisation scheme and associated codebreaks, 
giving details of individual patient treatment, will be produced by computer software that 
incorporates a standard procedure for generating random numbers.  The patients will be 
allocated to treatment in balanced blocks.

Blinding and procedures for unblinding the study  

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 
3.7 
3.7.1  Methods for ensuring blinding 
The study medication will be supplied as beige film-coated tablets.  ZD4054 with matching 
placebo will be identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the 
medication.  Labels will be blinded to treatment assignment.  Medication will be labelled 
using a unique material pack code which is linked to the randomisation scheme.  The 
Centralised Registration/Randomisation Centre will assign the bottle of study material to be 
dispensed to each patient at each visit. 

All study personnel will be unaware of the randomised treatment until all decisions on the 
evaluability of the data from all patients have been made and documented (with the exception 
of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee and York Bioanalytical Solutions for PK 
analysis who require the randomisation code to allow prioritisation of samples from patients 
on active treatment). 

3.7.2  Methods for unblinding the study 
The active and placebo tablets will be identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure 
blinding of the medication.  The patient’s randomisation code break will be available through 
the Centralised Registration/Randomisation Centre.  The procedure for this will be described 
in the IVRS manual that will be provided to each investigational centre. 

The treatment code must not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient necessitates knowledge of the treatment randomisation.  Where 
appropriate, the investigator will consult with the study team physician to ascertain whether 
the situation warrants breaking the code.  See Section 9.2.  The investigator(s) must document 
and report to ICON any breaking of the treatment code.  The investigator may break the code 
only after a decision has been made to withdraw the a patient from the study and if the 
investigator requires immediate knowledge of the study medication to optimise the clinical 
management of the patient.  AstraZeneca Drug Safety retains the right to break the code for 
SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an investigational 
product and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. 

Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the 
evaluability of the data from each individual patient have been made and documented.  The 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will not be blinded, and will be provided 
with the random scheme prior to the first patient being randomised. 

Pre-study, concomitant and post-study treatment(s) 

3.8 
The administration of all medication (including investigational products) must be recorded in 
the appropriate sections of the eCRF.

part in the study.  Bisphosphonate therapy, if infused, must be administered at 
least 1 week before bone scans are performed.  In patients where bisphosphonates 
are to be stopped prior to entry into the study, there must be a washout of 4 weeks 
prior to randomisation to the study. 

Medically castrated patients must remain on castration therapy throughout the 
study, and must have been on stable treatment for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to 
starting study treatment.  The castration therapy dose must also remain stable 
during the study. 

Potent CYP450 inducers (such as phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine and 
phenobarbitone, St John’s Wort) should be avoided while on study therapy.  
Dexamethasone will be allowed if the investigator feels it is necessary, but is 
encouraged to use a different form of steroid treatment wherever possible. 

Patients taking drugs with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored closely.

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

Although there is currently no evidence that ZD4054 affects warfarin pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics, it is recommended that patients taking warfarin or a coumarin preparation 
should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time and international normalised 
ratio (at least once a week during the first month and then according to findings) and 
adjustments made to their anticoagulant therapy accordingly. 

Although there is currently no evidence that ZD4054 affects the pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics of digoxin, it is recommended that patients taking digoxin are monitored 
regularly with trough digoxin level measurements every 1 to 2 weeks in the first month and 
then every 1 to 3 months thereafter. 

Patients are allowed to receive other cardioactive drugs, but should be monitored more closely 
in the first 2 months of the study. 

After completion of the study patients may be treated according to local medical practice. 

Treatment compliance 

3.9 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure compliance of all treatments.  Patients must be 
instructed to bring their ZD4054 or placebo (in the original containers) with them for all clinic 
visits.  The investigator, and/or designee, will count each patient’s ZD4054 or placebo at each 
study visit that the patient is required to return their study drug. 

If a patient loses their study medication, the patient will be dispensed a new bottle of study 
medication.  The patient should bring both the old and new bottles to the clinic at the next 
visit, if found.   

3.10  Management of toxicity 
Dose interruptions may be used to manage any ZD4054/placebo related toxicity, dose 
reductions are not possible.  If study treatment is interrupted for greater than 2 weeks, the 
decision to resume treatment must be made in conjunction with the Study Team Physician.  
Interruptions in dosing regimen will be recorded.  In the case of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 cardiac 
failure study treatment will not be restarted unless the case has been discussed with the Study 
Team Physician and agreement made for study medication to be re-started.  Repeat dose 
interruptions are allowed as required, for a maximum of 14 days (discuss with Study Team 
Physician).  Where a patient’s dose interruption is >14 days or is to exceed >2 dose 
interruptions due to a grade 3 or greater non-haematological adverse event or a grade 4 
haematological adverse event, this should be discussed with the Study Team Physician before 
trial therapy is re-dispensed (see Section 3.4.2 Doses and treatment regimes). 

Treatment for headache 

3.10.1 
Any patient experiencing headache should be strongly encouraged to take appropriate 
analgesia eg. paracetamol/acetaminophen 1 g (unless otherwise contraindicated), as soon as 
the headache is experienced.  If the headache continues to worsen despite the administration 
of full dose simple analgesia such as paracetamol/acetaminophen, then the choice of further

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

FACT-P 

4.3.1 
4.3.1.1  Methods of assessment 
FACT-P has been developed to measure HRQOL in men with prostate cancer (Cella et al 
1993, Esper et al 1997).  It consists of 4 subscales (physical, emotional, functional and 
social/family well-being) plus a 12-item prostate-specific module, using the Prostate Cancer 
Symptom (PCS) subscale, that highlights concerns specific to patients with prostate cancer 
(See Appendix J).  The FACT-P questionnaire will only be administered in countries for 
which a validated translation is available.  Refer to the study plan (Table 2) for times of 
assessment. 

4.3.1.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
For the functional well being (FWB) domain and FACT-P total score, changes from baseline 
for each time point will be calculated for each treatment group.   

For the FWB and FACT-P total score, changes from baseline for each time point will be 
calculated for each treatment group.  Responses will be assigned for each patient as the best 
response of “Improved”, “No Change” and “Worsened”.  The relationship between FWB and 
total FACT-P responses and clinical responses will also be explored. 

If less than 50% of the subscale items are missing, the subscale score will be divided by the 
number of non-missing items and multiplied by the total number of items on the subscale.  If 
50% or more of the items are missing, that subscale will be treated as missing. 

The following table defines visit responses for FWB and FACT-P.  This response should be 
maintained for 2 consecutive visits. 

Table 5

Does not qualify for overall score response of 
“improved” or “no change”.  A visit response of 
“worsened” 
Does not qualify for one of the above 

Brief pain inventory (BPI) 

4.3.2 
4.3.2.1  Methods of assessment 
Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (see Appendix H) at the times 
outlined in the study plan (Table 2). 

4.3.2.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
Change in the BPI will be calculated as change from baseline at each clinic visit.   

Time to worsening of pain is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
first assessment of worsening of pain. Worsening of pain is defined as an increase in worst 
pain BPI score to a score of at least 5. 

Analgesic use 

4.3.3 
4.3.3.1  Methods of assessment 
Analgesic use will be collected in the eCRF and will be used as a secondary criterion for 
worsening of pain. 

4.3.3.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
Change in patient reported analgesic use from baseline will be determined from the clinical 
database.

Date 18 June 2007 

EQ-5D 

4.3.4 
4.3.4.1  Methods of assessment 
Patient Health Status will be assessed by the EQ-5D (EuroQuol-5 Dimension), a validated and 
well known utility measure (See Appendix I) which consists of 5 questions.  This has been 
translated into multiple languages.  The EQ-5D questionnaire will only be administered in 
those countries where there is a validated translation available.  Refer to the study plan 
(Table 2) for times of assessment.   

4.3.4.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
The proportion of patients with each score for each item will be summarised for each time 
point and by treatment allocation. 

Completion of PRO questionnaires 

4.3.5 
Each centre must allocate responsibility for monitoring compliance with completion of the 
above PRO questionnaires to a specific individual (eg, a Research Nurse).  The ICON Clinical 
Team will arrange for relevant training in administration of the questionnaires.  The PRO 
questionnaires should be administered and completed at the clinic per the Study Plan, Table 2  
Patients must complete the FACT-P questionnaire before completing the EQ-5D 
questionnaire.  

It is also important that the significance and relevance of the data are explained carefully to 
participating patients so that they are motivated to comply with data collection (Fallowfield et 
al 1987). 

The PRO questionnaires will only be administered in those countries where there are validated 
translations available. 

The date of completion of each PRO questionnaire should be recorded.   

The instructions for completion of the PRO are as follows: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

It must be completed in private by the patient in their own time 

It must be completed by the patient before any investigations or discussions about 
their disease with the clinic staff 

On completion of the questionnaire it should be handed back to the PRO designated 
person who should check for completeness 

Only 1 answer should be recorded for each question 

The patient should not receive help from relatives, friends or clinic staff to answer 
the questionnaire.  However, if the patient is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is 
blind or illiterate) the questionnaire may be read out and responses recorded.

Week 12 (visit 5) 
At Visit 5 samples will be taken at the following time points: 

Pre-dose, 1-3 hours post-dose 

Collection of biological samples 

4.4.1 
Separate blood samples, 2.7 mL for the determination of ZD4054 in plasma will be collected 
into lithium heparin tubes at the time points specified in the Study Plan, Table 2 and detailed 
in Section 4.4 above.  The date and time of sample collection will be recorded on the eCRF.  
The sample tubes will be clearly labelled with the study number, patient Ecode, visit number, 
collection date and protocol time of sample.  The samples will be centrifuged within 
30 minutes of collection, during this period all blood samples should be placed on ice.  Blood 
samples will be centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at 1500 G to provide plasma.  Plasma 
samples will be transferred to individually labelled tubes using a polypropylene pipette.  
Plasma samples for analysis should be stored at no warmer than -20°C until transported to 
Quintiles Laboratories where they will be stored before forwarding to York Bioanalytical 
Solutions (YBS) Ltd, Cedar House, Northminster Business Park, Northfield Lane, Upper 
Poppleton, York, YO26 6QF for analysis.  Samples must be shipped from the site to Quintiles 
Laboratories within 1 month of collection.  Refer to Appendix N for shipping instructions. 

All samples will be analysed within 4 months after collection, the time period for which the 
stability of ZD4054 in the samples has been validated and found acceptable.  Results will not 
be generated for samples that have been stored for more than 4 months prior to analysis and 
any results generated which are subsequently found to be from samples which had exceeded 
this storage period will not be reported. 

4.4.2 

Drug concentration measurements, and derivation or calculation of 
pharmacokinetic parameters 

Drug concentrations will be determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with 
tandem mass-spectrometric (HPLC-MS-MS) detection by York Bioanalytical Solutions Ltd, 
Cedar House, Northminster Business Park, Northfield Lane, Upper Poppleton, York, 
YO26 6QF.   

The plasma concentration-time data will be analysed by mixed effects modelling.  The aim is 
to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ZD4054 including estimating 
pharmacokinetic variables, quantifying variability and attempting to identify potentially 
important covariates for the observed variability.  A detailed pharmacokinetics data analysis 
plan will be provided prior to database lock.  The analysis will be reported separately in a 
pharmacokinetic report. 

4.4.3 
Relationships between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures 
The relationships between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic measures such as 
adverse events, time to progression and PSA will be explored.  Initially graphical 
representation of the data will be performed, but mixed effect modelling will also be

4.5.3.1  Methods of assessment 
Opiate use is defined as use of opiates for a duration of ≥1 week for prostate cancer 
metastasis.  There must be a relationship between the pain and a metastatic site.  If a patient 
starts the study taking PRN opiates for non-disease-related symptoms, or requires opiates 
during the study for non-disease-related symptoms, and subsequently develops pain due to 
prostate cancer metastasis, then progression will be defined as an increase in opiate use for 
≥1 week. 

4.5.3.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
Time to use of opiates will be calculated from date of randomisation.  Patients who have not 
had an event at the point of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to have 
been assessed. 

4.5.4 
Skeletal related events 
4.5.4.1  Methods of assessment 
Skeletal related event is defined as the first of any of the following: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Pathologic fracture 

Vertebral compression fracture not related to trauma 

Prophylactic surgery or radiation for impending fracture or spinal cord 
compression 

Spinal cord compression. 

4.5.4.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
Time to skeletal events will be calculated from the date of randomisation.  Patients who have 
not had an event at the point of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to 
have been assessed. 

Objective progression of visceral or nodal disease (RECIST) 

4.5.5 
4.5.5.1  Methods of assessment 
CT or MRI of the pelvis and abdomen at baseline and at discontinuation of trial therapy as 
specified in the Study Plan, Table 2 (Appendix K), with additional CT or MRI performed as 
clinically indicated (eg, Chest CT for pulmonary metastases).  Lesions must be assessed using 
the same method and technique on each occasion.  A patient will be determined to have 
progressed if they have progression of target lesions, clear progression of existing non-target 
lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

4.5.5.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
Time to progression will be calculated from date of randomisation.  Patients who have not had 
an event at the point of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to have 
been assessed. 

Bone lesions (Bone scintigraphy) 

4.5.6 
Bone scintigraphy (bone scans) will be performed at the time points specified in the study 
plan, Table 2.  A bone scan (and CT or MRI) will also be performed as clinically indicated 
(eg, if there is increased pain, opiate use for more than one week or a skeletal related event), 
or any time an investigator decides to take a patient off the study (exit scan). 

4.5.6.1  Methods of assessment 
Bone scans must be performed locally in accordance with any local protocol, and will be 
reviewed by the Investigator. 

The WBDC system will collect information on whether a bone scan has been performed, the 
date of the bone scan and outcome data.   

4.5.6.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
The number of metastatic bone lesions at baseline and at the discontinuation of study 
treatment scan will be recorded by the Investigator.  Time to progression of bone metastases 
will be calculated from the date of randomisation to the first appearance of four or more new 
bone lesions confirmed by bone scan (with CT, MRI scan or x-ray performed as necessary).  
Patients who have not had an event at the point of analysis will be censored at the time they 
were last known to have been assessed. 

PSA progression  

4.5.7 
4.5.7.1  Methods of assessment 
Blood samples for PSA analysis will be collected using serum separation gel tubes.  
Assessments will be performed at Quintiles Laboratories at the time points specified in the 
Study Plan, Table 2.  PSA progression is defined as the time to the first PSA value ≥50% from 
baseline, seen in at least 2 consecutive PSA values. 

4.5.7.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
Time to PSA progression will be calculated from date of randomisation to date of first sample 
which shows rise in PSA of at least 50% from baseline.  Patients who have not had an event at 
the point of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to have been assessed.

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

Time to first administration of chemotherapy 

4.5.8 
4.5.8.1  Methods of assessment 
The administration of all concomitant therapies including date of starting therapy will be 
recorded at each visit.  Chemotherapies will be identified from the administered concomitant 
therapies. 

4.5.8.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
Time to first administration of chemotherapy will be calculated from date of randomisation.  
Patients who have not had an event at the point of analysis will be censored at the time they 
were last known to have been assessed. 

Safety measurements and variables 

4.6 
The methods for collecting safety data are described below.  Blood and urine samples for 
determination of clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis parameters will be taken at 
the times given in the study plan (Table 2). 

Adverse events 

4.6.1 
4.6.1.1  Definitions 
The definitions of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and other significant 
adverse events (OAEs) are given below.  It is of the utmost importance that all staff involved 
in the study are familiar with the content of this section.  The principal investigator is 
responsible for ensuring this. 

Adverse event 
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration 
of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 

Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, 
washout, follow-up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: 

• 

• 

• 

Results in death 

Is immediately life-threatening 

Requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation

• 

• 

• 

Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 

Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 

Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 

The causality of SAEs (ie, their relationship to study treatment) will be assessed by the 
investigator(s), who in completing the relevant case report form must answer “yes” or “no” to 
the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by any of the following – study medication – other medication?”.  For further 
guidance on the definition of a SAE and a guide to the interpretation of the causality question, 
see Appendix B to the Clinical Study Protocol. 

Note that SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure should also be reported.  
For such events the causal relationship is implied as “yes”. 

Other Significant Adverse Events (OAE) 
OAEs will be identified by the Study Team Physician in consultation with the appropriate 
Global Drug Safety Physician during the evaluation of safety data for the CSR.  Significant 
adverse events of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to 
discontinuation of the patient from study treatment, will be classified as OAEs.  Examples of 
these are marked haematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain events that 
lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), or significant additional 
treatment.  For each OAE, a narrative may be written and included in the CSR. 

4.6.1.2  Recording of adverse events 
When to collect AEs 
Collection of non-serious AEs and SAEs during run-in, baseline and treatment periods 
Non-serious adverse events and SAEs should be collected from the time consent is given, 
throughout the treatment period and up to and including the follow-up period.  After data 
cut-off when 263 deaths have occurred, only SAE data will be collected from patients still 
continuing on study treatment. 

Duration of post-treatment follow-up period 
Adverse events will be collected throughout the study.  Any AEs that occur from the time of 
informed consent, during the study and in the 28 days following the last administration of 
study treatment should be recorded. 

After discontinuation from treatment any new AEs or SAEs occurring within 28 days after the 
last dose of study drug should be documented in the eCRF modules, if the event is an SAE it 
should be reported to ICON in the usual manner.

Date 18 June 2007 

In addition, all study-related toxicities and SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless, in 
the Investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying 
disease. 

Post-study events 
After study completion (ie, after any scheduled follow-up period) there is no obligation for the 
investigator to actively report information on new AE or SAEs occurring in former study 
patients.  However, if an investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at anytime after a 
patient has completed the study and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event is related to the investigational product, the investigator should notify ICON. 

Following data cut-off, patients who are considered, by the investigator, to be deriving clinical 
benefit will be allowed to continue to receive study treatment.  SAE data will be collected for 
all patients continuing on study treatment. 

Handling of unresolved AEs and SAEs 
Adverse events should be collected for up to 28 days after last dose administration. 

All study-related AEs and all SAEs must be proactively followed until resolution, unless the 
event is considered by the investigator to be unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying 
disease, or the patient is lost to follow up.  Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution 
for all events, even if they continue after discontinuation/study completion. 

Any SAE that is ongoing when the patient completes the study, or at patient discontinuation 
from the study, must be followed up to resolution, unless the SAE is considered by the 
investigator to be unlikely to resolve, or the patient is lost to follow up. 

ICON and AstraZeneca reserve the right to ask for further information/clarification on any 
adverse event that may be considered of interest. 

Collection and reporting of discontinuations of treatment due to AE  
Only AEs which caused the patient to permanently stop taking study treatment should be 
reported on the AE eCRF module as a permanent discontinuation of study treatment.  The 
reason given for withdrawal/ permanent discontinuation of study treatment should be given as 
‘adverse event.’  

What AEs to collect 
Handling of symptoms of Disease Under Study, Disease Progression and Endpoints 
(a) 

Disease under study 

Any events that are unequivocally due to disease under study (DUS) must not be reported as 
an AE or SAE.  Signs and symptoms clearly associated with the DUS should not be reported 
as AEs unless they are newly emergent (ie, not previously observed in the patient) judged by 
the investigator to be unusually severe or accelerated, or if the investigator considers

deterioration of disease-related signs and symptoms to be caused directly by the drug.  If there 
is any uncertainty about an AE being solely due to the DUS it should be reported as an AE or 
SAE as appropriate 

(b) 

Disease progression 

Symptoms of disease progression will not be recorded as AEs. 

Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the IP is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the 
disease or  an increase in the symptoms of the disease.  Expected progression of the disease 
under study (DUS) and/or expected progression of signs and symptoms of the DUS, unless 
more severe in intensity or more frequent than expected for the patient’s condition, should not 
be reported as an AE.  Events which are unequivocally due to disease progression must not be 
reported as an AE/SAE. 

The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under 
study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Signs and symptoms 
clearly associated with metastases present at study entry should not be reported as AEs unless 
they are newly emergent (ie, not previously observed in the patient), judged by the 
Investigator to be unusually severe or accelerated, or if the investigator considers deterioration 
of disease related signs and symptoms to be caused directly by the drug. 

(c) 

Handling of lack of efficacy 

Where there is deterioration in the condition for which the study treatment is being used, there 
may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or constitutes an AE.  In such cases, 
unless the AstraZeneca or reporting physician considers that the study treatment contributed to 
the deterioration, or local regulations state to the contrary, the deterioration should be 
considered to be lack of efficacy and not an AE. 

(d) 

Handling of new cancers 

The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet at 
least one of the serious criteria.  New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason 
for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusion of the 
patient into the study. 

(e) 

Handling of deaths 

All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol-defined follow-up period after 
the administration of the last dose of study treatment, must be reported as follows: 

• 

Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported to the study 
monitor at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the eCRF but 
should not be reported as a SAE.

• 

• 

Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of DUS, the AE causing 
the death must be reported to the study monitor as a SAE within 24 hours.  The 
report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of 
disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death. 

Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.  A post 
mortem maybe helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a 
copy of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to AstraZeneca, Drug Safety 
within the usual timeframes. 

Laboratory tests and vital signs 
The reporting of protocol mandated laboratory/vital signs abnormalities as both laboratory 
findings and AEs should be avoided.  They should not be reported as AEs unless a criterion 
for an SAE is fulfilled, the laboratory vital signs abnormality causes the patient to discontinue 
treatment with the IP, or if the investigator feels strongly that it should be reported as an AE. 

If an abnormal laboratory value/vital sign is associated with a diagnosis or clinical 
signs/symptoms, the diagnosis or sign/symptom should be reported as an AE and the 
associated laboratory result/vital sign should be considered additional information to support 
the diagnosis. 

How to collect AEs 
At each visit the method of detecting AEs and SAEs in this study will be by: 

• 

• 

• 

information volunteered by the patient, the patient’s parent or carer 

open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient at every visit such as 
the following: How are you feeling? Have you had any (other) medical problems 
since your last visit.  Suggest using the protocol standard question – ‘Have you 
had any health problems since the previous visit / last questioning?’ – in the local 
or native language 

observation by the investigational team, other care providers or relatives. 

Collection of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event grade 
Adverse events will be recorded by means of the CTCAE for adverse events (version 3) for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  Where there are no assigned CTCAE grades, there 
is a recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate and severe into 
CTCAE grades (CTCAE 1 = mild, CTCAE 2 = moderate, CTCAE 3 = severe, CTCAE 4 = 
life threatening / disabling, CTCAE 5 = death).   

It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 4.6.1.1.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke

that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would 
usually be a SAE 

Collection of time of onset and resolution of AE 
Onset and resolution dates for all AEs and SAEs should be collected and recorded on the 
eCRF.  For events more than 24 hours’ duration the precise time of onset/resolution is not 
deemed critical to the study and thus need not be collected. 

Overdose 
Should an overdose (accidental or deliberate) occur, it must be reported in accordance with the 
procedures described in Section 9.3, Procedures in case of overdose, regardless of whether the 
overdose was associated with any symptom or not.  All symptoms associated with the 
overdose should be reported as AEs. 

Code breaks 
All code breaks will be managed by the IVRS.  Details of the procedure will be provided in 
the IVRS manual.  Where appropriate, the investigator will consult with the study team 
physician to ascertain whether the situation warrants breaking the code.   

The investigator may break the code only after a decision has been made to withdraw a patient 
from the study and if the investigator requires immediate knowledge of the study medication 
to optimise the clinical management of the patient.  The investigator must notify ICON of any 
code breaks and provide a written report which will be archived.   

Pregnancy 
Should a pregnancy occur in the patient’s partner, it must be reported in accordance with the 
procedures described in Section 9.4, Procedures in case of pregnancy.  Pregnancy in itself is 
not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational product may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 

4.6.1.3  Reporting of serious adverse events 
Investigators and other site personnel must inform appropriate ICON representatives of any 
SAE that occurs in the course of the study within 1 day (ie, immediately but no later than the 
end of the next business day) of when he or she becomes aware of it. 

SAE information will be entered and submitted into the Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) 
system on the relevant eCRF modules.  An automated email alert will be sent to the 
designated ICON representative who will work with the investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is available in the system within the required time frames, but taking 
advantage of the time allocated in those timelines.  The ICON representative will notify the 
appropriate AstraZeneca Drug Safety department through the WBDC system via email that a 
completed electronic SAE module and relevant information from other appropriate eCRF 
modules is available in the WBDC system.  If the system is unavailable, the investigator 
should fax a paper back-up SAE report to the ICON representative immediately, recognising

that the same reporting time frames still apply.  The investigator is responsible for completing 
the eCRF as soon as the system becomes available again.   

Follow-up information on SAEs must also be reported by the investigator within the same 
time frames. 

If follow-up indicates a change in the SAE from serious to fatal or life-threatening, this 
information needs to be available in the WBDC system within 1 calendar day. 

If a non-serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow-up information must also 
be provided to ICON within 1 day as described above. For a non-serious AE that become 
serious but which is not fatal or life-threatening a report should be received within 5 days. 

The ICON representative will work with the investigator to compile all the necessary 
information and ensure that the appropriate AstraZeneca Drug Safety Department receives a 
report by day 1 for all fatal and life-threatening cases and by day 5 for all other SAEs. 

All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product, any other medication or to the study procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  The investigator and/or Sponsor are responsible for informing the Ethics Committee 
and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.  For studies in 
countries implementing the EU Clinical Trials Directive, this will be taken care of by ICON 
(see Section 8.1). 

Laboratory safety measurements and variables 

4.6.2 
Laboratory assessments should be performed at a certified central laboratory according to the 
Study Plan, Table 2.  The date of sample collection will be recorded in the WBDC system. 

All patients who have any CTCAE grade 3 or 4 laboratory values (see NCI CTCAE Version 
3.0) at the time of withdrawal must be followed up until they have returned to CTCAE grade 1 
or 2, unless they are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  Additional 
samples may be taken, as clinically indicated.

BNP Assessment 
A rise in BNP has been shown to be an indicator for the development of cardiac failure.  
Although causal relationship to therapy has not been established, a small number of patients 
receiving ZD4054 in previous studies have developed cardiac failure.  

An exploratory objective in this study is therefore to explore the utility of BNP in monitoring 
patients with hormone resistant prostate cancer receiving ZD4054.  Comparison of the BNP 
levels over time and between ZD4054 and placebo arms will allow assessment of the effect of 
ZD4504 on BNP levels.  Any correlation between change in BNP over time and 
cardiovascular adverse events will also be explored.  In view of the exploratory nature of the 
BNP measurement, the results will not be routinely sent to investigators.  However, any 
significant change in BNP levels will be highlighted to investigators together with 
recommendations as to further patient assessment and management.

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

The available data for BNP will be assessed along with other safety data at the regular 
assessment by the IDMC who will decide on its utility in the trial: in the event of it being of 
poor utility in patient monitoring, the IDMC may advise that further sample collection be 
stopped.  In this event, no protocol amendment will be issued, investigators will be informed 
by letter to discontinue collection of this sample. 

4.6.3  Methods of assessment 
Clinical chemistry 
Blood samples will be collected using lithium heparin tubes and processed as directed in the 
Laboratory Handbook for Investigators.  Samples will be sent to Quintiles Laboratories for 
assessment.  Results will be faxed back to the study centres by the central laboratory.  A hard 
copy of these results will also be sent by mail. 

BNP 
Blood samples will be collected using 4 mL EDTA Vacutainer draw tubes and processed as 
directed in the Laboratory Handbook for Investigators.  Samples will be sent to Quintiles 
Laboratories for assessment.  Results will not be sent to study centres unless there are 
significant changes and the management of the patient needs to be discussed with the Study 
Team Physician.   

Haematology 
Blood samples will be collected using EDTA tubes and processed as directed in the 
Laboratory Handbook for Investigators.  Samples will be sent to Quintiles Laboratories for 
assessment.  Results will be faxed back to the study centres by the central laboratory.  A hard 
copy of these results will also be sent by mail. 

Urinalysis 
A sample of urine will be collected and analyzed locally at the investigator centre using 
dipstick analysis, as directed on the dipstick packaging. 

Dipsticks will be provided to the centre by Quintiles Laboratories.   

The following parameters will be assessed: specific gravity, blood, glucose and protein.   

Vital signs, ECG and physical examination 

4.6.4 
4.6.4.1  Methods of assessment 
Assessments must be performed at the time points specified in the Study Plan, Table 2. 

Vital signs consist of heart rate and blood pressure. 

Vital signs will be measured after the patient has been resting for at least 5 minutes.  Blood 
pressure will be measured using a generally accepted cuff method.  For each patient 
throughout the study, blood pressure will be measured using the same arm.

Date 18 June 2007 

Resting 12-lead ECG 
Twelve-lead ECGs will be performed for all patients at the time points indicated in the study 
plan (Table 2).  ECGs (run at 25 mm/second) will be obtained whilst the patient is supine and 
has rested supine for 3 to 5 minutes.  The ECGs for each patient should be carried out at the 
same time of day, where possible, and at a time that is consistent in relation to food intake. 

Additional ECGs should be obtained if clinically justified. 

ECGs must be of high quality and free of movement artefact or electrical interference.  A 
repeat ECG is to be taken if the first recording is of suspect quality.  ECG recording should be 
a minimum of 10 seconds (or 10 cycles) of artefact-free recording, without premature 
ventricular contractions (PVCs) if possible.  It is recommended that the same machine is used 
for the same patient throughout the study. 

Two identical paper copies of all ECGs (including any additional ECGs) should be obtained.  
One must be retained in the patient’s medical records, and the other will be collected by the 
ICON monitor and returned to ICON. 

ECGs will be reviewed for safety by the investigator.  Any clinically significant abnormal 
changes from screening should be recorded as AEs or SAEs. 

Physical examination 
A complete physical examination, including height (screening only) and weight, will be 
performed at each visit, as specified in the Study Plan, Table 2.  Any new conditions or 
exacerbation of existing conditions reported at subsequent visits will be reported on the 
adverse event form.  Only those findings that are in addition to the condition being treated will 
be recorded as adverse events.  Conditions that are unequivocally disease-related must not be 
recorded as adverse events unless they result in death during the study treatment period or 
within 28 days after the administration of the last dose of study treatment.

Analysis of biological samples 

4.7.1 
The analyte stability limits defined by Quintiles Laboratories will be applied to all analyses 
performed on behalf of AstraZeneca.  Quintiles Laboratories will not analyse samples that fall 
outside these stability limits.  Analytical data will not be reported if found to have been 
derived from a sample that fell outside these stability limits.  The standards of procedure 
followed by Quintiles Laboratories may be amended in accordance with its Standard 
Operating Procedures.  Quintiles Laboratories will inform ICON of the stability limits relevant 
to this study before the first patient gives informed consent to take part in the study. 

If Quintiles Laboratories chooses to sub-contract the analytical work to another laboratory, 
Quintiles Laboratories must assure itself and provide assurance to ICON that the other 
laboratory will apply defined stability limits to all analyses performed on behalf of 
AstraZeneca.  Samples falling outside these limits must not be analysed or data reported. The 
other laboratory will inform ICON of the stability limits relevant to this study before the first 
patient gives informed consent to take part in the study.

thoroughly as directed in the Laboratory Handbook for Investigators.  Tubes will be labelled 
with the protocol study number, centre number, enrolment code and date of sample collection.  
No personal identifiers (patient name, initials or date of birth) will be placed on the tube or 
accompanying documentation.  A record of the date of the patient consent to the genetic 
research and the date of the blood sample collection will be recorded in the appropriate section 
of the eCRF. 

Genotype is a stable parameter, therefore if for any reason the blood sample is not drawn at 
Visit 2, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit.  The genetic blood sample should 
ideally be drawn through the same cannula used to draw blood samples required for the main 
study. 

4.8.1.1  Methods of assessment 
Blood samples for this optional assessment will be collected using polypropylene tubes 
containing ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), and processed as directed in the 
Laboratory Handbook for Investigators.  Samples will be sent to Quintiles Laboratories for 
processing and storage.  All blood and DNA samples will be destroyed 15 years after the main 
study is completed. 

4.8.1.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variable 
The number of patients who will agree to participate in the genetic component of this study is 
unknown.  It is, therefore, not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to 
allow a formal statistical evaluation or whether only descriptive statistics will be generated.  A 
statistical analysis plan will be prepared, where appropriate. 

Sample processing and shipping 

4.8.1.3 
Samples will be frozen (-20°C or below) and transported to the relevant DNA extraction 
laboratory within 1 month of collection and must remain frozen at all times.  Refer to the 
Laboratory Manual. 

Where possible samples should be shipped in batches and shipment should be coordinated 
with the receiving site to ensure that samples arrive within working hours.  A requisition 
sheet, detailing the protocol study number, centre number, enrolment code and date of sample 
collection, should accompany the shipment. 

Storage and coding of DNA samples 

4.8.1.4 
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are 
important to maintain patient confidentiality. 

For all samples irrespective of the type of coding used the DNA will be extracted from the 
blood sample.  The DNA sample will be assigned a unique number replacing the information 
on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the DNA sample will be identifiable by the unique DNA 
number only.  The DNA number will be used to identify the sample and corresponding data at 
the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated contract laboratory.  No personal

details identifying the individual will be available to any AstraZeneca employee working with 
the DNA. 

The blood samples and data for genetic analysis in this study will be single coded.  Each blood 
sample will be labelled with the study number and enrolment code.  Only the investigator will 
be able to link the blood sample to the individual patient.  The sample and data will not be 
labelled with a personal identifier.  The link between the subject enrolment code and the DNA 
number will be maintained.   

This link file and any corresponding genetic data will be stored in a secure environment, with 
restricted access within the Clinical Genotyping Group Laboratory Information Management 
System (LIMS) at AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, UK.  The link will be used to identify the 
relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotyping results with clinical 
data, allow regulatory audit and to trace samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of 
consent.   

All DNA samples will be stored under secure conditions with restricted access at AstraZeneca 
or the contracted laboratory.  The blood, DNA samples or data derived from the samples may 
be made available to groups or organisations working with AstraZeneca on this study or as 
part of the development drug project.  However, the samples and any results will remain the 
property of AstraZeneca at all times.  AstraZeneca will not give blood, DNA samples or data 
derived from the samples to any other parties, except as required by law.  All blood and DNA 
samples will be destroyed 15 years after the main study is completed. 

Summary of genetic assessments and analysis 

4.8.1.5 
The purpose of the genetic research is to generate data for use in future retrospective analyses.  
Future analyses will explore genetic factors that may influence the disposition, efficacy, safety 
and tolerability to ZD4054 and/or susceptibility to or prognosis of the disease under 
investigation in this protocol.  The results of the genetic research will not form part of the 
CSR for this study.  The results may be pooled with genetic data from other studies on 
ZD4054 to generate hypotheses to be tested in future studies.   

Exploratory biomarker measurements and variables 
Collection of serum samples for exploratory biomarkers 

4.9 
4.9.1 
Patients will provide a 5 mL blood sample to be processed to 2.5 mL of serum at each of the 
visits referenced in the Study Plan (Table 2).  These serum samples will be stored for potential 
retrospective analysis of serum biomarkers.   

A single venous blood sample (5 mL) will be drawn into a serum tube and mixed by inversion 
5 times.  The sample is allowed to clot by standing at room temperature for 3 hours, then 
centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 minutes at room temperature.  The serum is carefully aspirated 
with a sterile transfer pipette into a second serum tube and centrifuged at 2000 g for 
10 minutes at room temperature.  The serum is finally transferred into 6 cryotubes (5 x 
200 μL) with the remainder into a single aliquot and frozen immediately at -80°C. Where

samples are shipped to Quintiles Laboratories monthly then storage at -20°C by the sites is 
acceptable.  The samples will be labelled with -80°C resistant labels that contain a unique 
sample identifier comprising the patient enrolment code, identifiers of sample type and 
purpose and aliquot number. 

The biomarker eCRF will capture consent given, date and time of sample acquisition and time 
of freezing.   

Sample shipping 

4.9.1.1 
Samples must be shipped frozen (-20°C or below) and transported to the relevant storage site 
within 1 month of collection.  Samples should be shipped in batches and coordinated with the 
receiving site to ensure their arrival within working hours.  A requisition sheet should 
accompany the shipment that details the study number, centre number, enrolment code, date 
of sample collection and unique identifier for each of the samples in the shipment. Where 
samples are shipped to Quintiles Laboratories monthly then storage at -20°C by the sites is 
acceptable. 

When the Quintiles Laboratories ships samples to AstraZeneca, the Tissue Bank manager 
should be advised of sample shipping 3 working days prior to the proposed shipping date. 

Contact details for the AstraZeneca Tissue bank are detailed below: 

Tissue Bank Manager: 
AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Mereside, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, Cheshire , SK10 4TG 

Collection of prostate cancer tissue samples for exploratory biomarkers 

4.9.2 
Patients who undergo biopsies or operative procedures eg, TURP which provide prostate 
cancer specimens will be asked to consent for a sample of tissue to undergo further analysis.  
In addition patients may be asked to consent to suitable samples collected and stored prior to 
study entry being sent for further analysis.  These samples will be stored for potential 
retrospective analysis of biomarkers.   

When investigators have specimens they believe may be suitable for biomarker analysis, or 
have patients scheduled to undergo tumour biopsy they should contact the AstraZeneca Tissue 
bank as detailed in Section 4.9.1.1 to confirm storage and transport requirements.  

The biomarker eCRF will capture consent given, date and time of sample acquisition and time 
of freezing. 

Summary of exploratory biomarker assessments and analysis 

4.9.3 
Possible future analysis is likely to be performed retrospectively and only the appropriate 
subset of samples taken forward to formal analysis.  The selection of this subset will be 
wholly dependent on the outcome data of this and other ZD4054 clinical studies.  Meta 
analysis of sample data may be performed which includes data from all ZD4054 studies.  
Exploratory analysis may enable the discovery of biomarkers characteristic of response to

treatment versus placebo in the patient population or biomarkers that influence efficacy, safety 
and tolerability to study treatments and prognosis/progression of disease.  Any data generated 
will not be reported as part of the CSR. 

Serum samples may be assessed using the most appropriate profiling method available at the 
time of analysis.  Typical methods may include 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass 
spectrometry, RT-PCR or other profiling methods yet to be determined in this rapidly 
developing field.  Quantitative measurements may be made to compare samples taken from 
individuals undergoing treatment, enabling the discovery of characteristic biomarkers of 
response to treatment. 

It is not possible to determine a statistical analysis plan at this stage as the subset of samples 
chosen for formal analysis will only become apparent following study completion and will be 
dependant upon associated clinical outcome data and sample QC.  A statistical analysis plan 
will be prepared where appropriate.

DATA MANAGEMENT 

Data will be entered into the ICON WBDC system at the study site.  Trained study personnel 
will be responsible for entering data on the observations, tests and assessments specified in the 
protocol into the WBDC system and according to the eCRF Instructions within 0-5 days.  The 
eCRF Instructions will also provide the study site with data entry instructions.  Data entered in 
the WBDC system will be immediately saved to a central database and changes tracked to 
provide an audit trail.  When data have been entered reviewed, edited and Source Data 
Verification (SDV) performed the principal investigator will be notified to sign the eCRF 
electronically as per the agreed project process and data will be locked to prevent further 
editing.  A copy of the eCRF will be archived at the study site. 

In the case of genotyping data, only the date the patient gave consent to participation in the 
genetic research and the date the blood sample was taken from the patient will be recorded in 
the eCRF and database.   

The genotyping data generated from the study will be stored in the AstraZeneca LIMS 
database or other appropriate system.  This database is a secure database, which is separate 
from the database used for the main study.  Some or all of the dataset from the main study 
may be duplicated within the AstraZeneca LIMS database for exploratory genetic analysis.   

Reporting of genotyping results 

5.1 
Results from any genetic research performed will be reported separately from the CSR.  
AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to patients, their family members, 
any insurance company, an employer, clinical study investigator, general physician or any 
other third party, unless required to do so by law.  The patient’s DNA will not be used for any 
purpose other than those described in the study protocol.

Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

Individual patients will not be identified in any report or publication resulting from this work.  
The data and results of this study may be reviewed with collaborators and published, but 
neither the patient’s name nor any other personal identifiers will appear in any publication or 
report.

STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE 

Statistical evaluation – general aspects 

6.1 
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalised before unblinding of the 
data.  Analyses will be performed using SAS and other validated software as appropriate.   

Where data are missing, the impact and scale will be investigated.  Where a baseline variable 
is missing, it may be possible to substitute the value recorded at a different pre-treatment visit.  
This would be considered for each variable independently and a decision on the strategy to 
deal with each variable being missing will be documented in the SAP prior to database lock. 

Summaries of the safety and efficacy data will be produced using graphs and standard 
summary statistics.  For continuous variables, these statistics will include (but not be limited 
to) the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.  For categorical data, 
these statistics will consist of frequencies and associated percentages.  Missing safety and 
efficacy data will not be included in the denominator of the percentage calculation.   

Measures of location (mean, median, minimum and maximum) will be reported to the same 
degree of precision as the raw data.  Measures of spread (standard deviation, standard error) 
will be reported to one further degree of precision.  Where confidence intervals are provided, 
unless otherwise stated, they will have been calculated using an assumption of normal 
distribution.   

Assumptions made when analysing the efficacy data will be checked using appropriate 
methods.  Output from such checks will not be included in the CSR.

Secondary objectives - pharmacokinetic measurements 

6.2.4 
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be carried out by, or under the guidance of, Clinical 
Pharmacology UK, AstraZeneca.  Estimates of pharmacokinetic variables and quantification 
of their variability will facilitate a better understanding of the pharmacokinetic properties of 
ZD4054. 

Exploratory objectives - pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic measurements 

6.2.5 
The relationship between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements such as PSA, 
time to progression and adverse events will be explored.  

Exploratory objectives – BNP measurements 

6.2.6 
BNP levels will be summarised by timepoint and treatment groups. The relationship between 
BNP and development of cardiac adverse events will be explored. 

Secondary and exploratory objectives - patient reported outcomes 

6.2.7 
The quality of life questionnaires that will be summarised are the FACT-P and EQ-5D.  Data 
will be summarised by treatment group, and changes in different domains and scales will be 
correlated with clinical changes.  Compliance in completion of the questionnaires for each 
treatment group will be summarised at each time point. 

Change in pain level over time will be assessed according to the worst item score of the BPI 
assessment scale. 

Description of analysis sets 

6.3 
Five patient analysis sets will be defined in this study: 

Intention to Treat (ITT) set 
The ITT set will be defined as all patients randomised.   

The ITT set will be the primary set used for the efficacy analyses. 

Patients in the ITT set will be analysed according to the treatment they were randomised to 
receive. 

Safety set 
The safety set will include patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication.  Patients 
in the safety set will be analysed according to the treatment they received. 

Quality of life set 
The quality of life set will be defined as a subset of the ITT set but including only those 
patients who have valid baseline and at least one follow up quality of life measure.  This 
analysis set will be the primary set analysed for all quality of life endpoints.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) set 
The PK set will be defined as a subset of the safety set but including only those patients for 
whom PK blood samples were taken.  This analysis set will be the primary set analysed for the 
PK variables only. 

Method of statistical analysis 
Baseline data 

6.4 
6.4.1 
Summaries of demographic and other baseline characteristics will be produced for the ITT 
population.  Additional summaries will be produced for the PP population if it differs by more 
than 20% with respect to patient numbers.  Summaries will be produced for all patients in 
each population.   

Listings of demographic and other baseline characteristics will be produced, including 
surgical history, medical history which will be summarised by System Organ Class and High 
Level term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 

Compliance 

6.4.2 
Compliance and exposure of daily usage of investigational product will be listed and 
summarised. 

Primary variable 

6.4.3 
Overall survival 
Overall survival will be analysed using the log-rank test.  Patients who have not died at the 
time of the analysis will be censored at the last available assessment date. 

The analysis results will be presented as hazard ratios, 95% confidence interval and p-values.  
A hazard ratio less than 1 would indicate that, on average, OS is improved on active treatment 
than on placebo.  Kaplan-Meier plots of the times to death will be produced.  Additional plots 
by covariate analysis may be presented if appropriate. 

Secondary variables 

6.4.4 
Progression Free Survival 
Progression free survival will be analysed using the log-rank test.  Progression is defined in 
Section 2.  Patients who have not progressed at the time of the analysis will be censored at the 
last available assessment date. 

The analysis results will be presented as hazard ratios, 95% confidence interval and p-values.  
A hazard ratio, less than 1 would indicate that, on average, progression free survival is longer 
on active treatment than on placebo.  Kaplan-Meier plots of the times to progression will be 
produced.  Additional plots by covariate may be presented if appropriate.

PSA progression 
Time to PSA progression will be analysed using the log-rank test.  Patients who have not had 
a PSA progression at the time of the analysis will be censored using the last available 
assessment date. 

The analysis will be presented as hazard ratios.  A hazard ratio less than 1 would indicate that, 
on average, times to PSA progression are longer on active treatment than on placebo.  The 
hazard ratios will be presented with 95% confidence intervals and p-values.  Kaplan-Meier 
plots of the times to PSA progression will be presented. 

PSA concentration 
The raw data collected at baseline and during the study plus changes and percentage changes 
from baseline will be presented using standard summary statistics.  No exploratory analyses 
will be performed. 

Pain control 
• 

Brief pain inventory (BPI) 

Each patient’s worst pain score BPI assessment at baseline and all time points will be listed 
individually.  The raw data, and the change from baseline at each time point will be presented 
for each treatment group using standard summary statistics.  The change from baseline at all 
pain assessments will be analysed using a mixed model to investigate whether there is a trend 
over time.  The analysis will include factors for treatment group and time after randomisation 
and a random effect for patient.  The baseline worst pain score BPI assessment will be 
included as a covariate. 

Time to chemotherapy 
Time to starting chemotherapy will be analysed using the log-rank test.  Patients who have not 
had chemotherapy at the time of the analysis will be censored at the last available assessment 
date. 

The analysis results will be presented as hazard ratios, 95% confidence interval and p-values.  
A hazard ratio less than 1 would indicate that, on average, time to event is longer on ZD4054 
than on placebo.  Kaplan-Meier plots of the times to event will be produced.  Additional plots 
by covariate may be presented if appropriate. 

Pharmacokinetics 
Listings of the plasma concentration data will be produced for inclusion in the clinical study 
report.  The plasma concentration-time data will be analysed by mixed effects modelling in 
order to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ZD4054, quantify variability and 
identify covariates which may explain the observed variability. 

The details of the planned analyses will be documented in a separate data analysis plan which 
will be finalised prior to commencing the analysis.

6.4.5 
Health Status 
• 

EQ-5D 

The proportion of patients with each score for each item will be summarised for each time-
point and by treatment allocation.  No further data explorations will be performed. 

Pharmacokinetic - Pharmacodynamic relationships 
The relationships between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic measures such as 
adverse events, time to progression and PSA will be explored.  This will initially be by 
graphical investigation of the data but, if feasible, mixed effects modelling of the data will be 
performed. 

Safety data 

6.4.6 
The Safety analysis set will be used as the primary analysis dataset for the reporting of safety 
data.  All safety data will be listed. 

Adverse events 
The number of patients reporting at least 1 AE in any system organ class will be presented. 

AEs will be summarised by preferred term within each system organ class.  For each preferred 
term, the number and percentage of patients reporting at least one occurrence will be 
presented.  Similar summaries of the number of patients reporting the most frequently 
reported AEs during the treatment period will be presented.  Most frequent AEs will be those 
reported, at preferred term level, in a pre-defined minimum percentage of patients within at 
least one treatment group; this defined minimum will be set at Blind Review of data before 
analysis. 

AEs will be summarised by causality and CTCAE grade.  All AEs will be listed for all 
patients.  Separate listings of all serious AEs (SAEs), deaths, other significant AEs (OAEs) or 
discontinuations due to AEs will be presented. 

Laboratory variables 
Scheduled laboratory results will be used for the summary tables.  All recorded laboratory 
data will be listed. 

All continuous laboratory parameters will be summarised by absolute value at each visit by 
treatment group, together with the corresponding changes from baseline.  Categorical 
laboratory parameters will be summarised by frequency counts and percentages at each visit 
by treatment group. 

All laboratory safety data will be listed, with clinically relevant abnormalities, as defined by 
the AstraZeneca extended reference ranges explicitly noted on the listings.

The vital signs data will be summarised by absolute value at each visit by treatment group.  
The corresponding changes from baseline will also be presented. 

Scheduled vital sign results will be used for the summary tables.  All recorded vital sign data 
will be listed with clinically relevant abnormalities noted on the listings. 

Physical examination 
Physical examination details will be listed and summarised by treatment group using standard 
summary statistics. 

Determination of sample size 

6.5 
A total of 580 patients will be recruited into this study. 

The formal analysis will be performed when 263 deaths have occurred.  Based on a 
recruitment period of 18 months and a median overall survival (OS) for the placebo group of 
approximately 19 months, it is estimated that 263 deaths will occur approximately 30 months 
after the first patient entered the study.  If the true hazard ratio for ZD4054 versus placebo is 
0.67, then the analysis will have 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant effect in 
overall survival at the 5% significance level. 

Interim analyses 

6.6 
One interim analysis is planned for this study and will occur when at least 50% of the death 
events have been reached.  Using the O’Brien-Fleming stopping rule, the level of significance 
for the interim analysis is 0.005 and the level of significance for the final analysis is 0.048. 

Data monitoring board 

6.7 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be responsible for safeguarding the 
interests of study participants, via review of accumulating safety and efficacy data for this 
study.  The IDMC will be composed of therapeutic area experts and statisticians who do not 
have significant conflicts of interests and therefore, will be neither study investigators in any 
phase III ZD4054 studies nor individuals employed by AstraZeneca.  The IDMC will review 
the interim efficacy analysis and will review safety data at least every 6-monthly for the first 
year and thereafter will recommend the intervals for subsequent reviews.

being accurately recorded in the eCRF, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed 

Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the eCRF with the 
patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to 
the study).  This will require direct access to all original records for each patient 
(eg, clinic charts) 

Perform source verification of the genetic consent of participating patients and 
ensure that the investigational team is adhering to the specific requirements of this 
genetic research. 

The monitor or another ICON representative will be available between visits if the 
investigator(s) or other staff at the centre need information and advice. 

Audits and inspections 

7.2 
Authorised representatives of ICON, AstraZeneca, a regulatory authority, or an Ethics 
Committee may visit the centre to perform audits or inspections, including source data 
verification.  The purpose of an ICON or AstraZeneca audit or inspection is to systematically 
and independently examine all study-related activities and documents to determine whether 
these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analysed, and accurately reported

Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines of the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigator should contact IOCN and AstraZeneca immediately if contacted by a regulatory 
agency about an inspection at his or her centre. 

Training of staff 

7.3 
The principal investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study 
(medical, nursing and other staff).  He or she will ensure that appropriate training relevant to 
the study is given to all of these staff, and that any new information of relevance to the 
performance of this study is forwarded to the staff involved. 

Before the first patient is entered into the study, the investigational staff will be trained to use 
the WBDC system by ICON personnel or delegates. 

Before the first patient is entered into the study the investigational staff will have an 
opportunity to discuss the procedures associated with the collection of blood samples, 
extraction of DNA and genetic research with ICON personnel.  The ethical considerations 
specific to genotyping and the importance of the informed consent process will be made clear.  
The requirements for the collections of the patients’ samples will also be made clear.   

Changes to the protocol 

7.4 
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the Co-ordinating 
Investigator and AstraZeneca. 

If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended, the amendment and/or a new version of 
the study protocol (Amended Protocol) must be notified to or approved by each Ethics 
Committee, and if applicable, also the local regulatory authority, before implementation.  
Local requirements must be followed. 

If an administrative change is required, such a change must be notified to or approved by each 
Ethics Committee according to local requirements. 

If a protocol amendment requires a change to a particular centre’s Informed Consent Form, 
then ICON and the centre’s Ethics Committee must be notified.  Approval of the revised 
Informed Consent Form by ICON and by the Ethics Committee is required before the revised 
form is used.   

ICON will distribute amendments and new versions of the protocol to each principal 
investigator(s) who in turn is responsible for the distribution of these documents to his or her 
Ethics Committee, and to the staff at his or her centre.  The distribution of these documents to 
the regulatory authority will be handled according to local practice.

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 

The Principal Investigator is also responsible for providing the Ethics Committee with reports 
of any serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the 
investigational product.  ICON will provide this information to the Principal Investigator. 

Progress reports and notifications of serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions will be 
provided to the Ethics Committee according to local regulations and guidelines.   

Where there is an optional genetic research, approval must be obtained for this genetic 
research and the associated genetic informed consent from the Ethics Committee.  It must be 
clearly stated in the approval that this genetic research is approved.  The investigator must 
submit written approval to AstraZeneca before any patient participates in this genetic research. 

Ethical conduct of the study 

8.2 
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, applicable 
regulatory requirements and the AstraZeneca policy on Bioethics.   

For studies including genetic analysis special precautions are taken as described in 
Section 4.8. 

Informed consent 

8.3 
The principal investigator(s) at each centre will ensure that the patient is given full and 
adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of 
the study.  Patients must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any 
time.  The patient should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to 
consider the information provided. 

The patient’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any 
procedure specifically for the study. 

The principal investigator(s) must store the original, signed Informed Consent Form.  A copy 
of the signed Informed Consent Form must be given to the patient. 

The genetic research is optional and the patient may participate in the main study without 
participating in the genetic component.  To participate in the genetic component of the study 
the patient must sign and date both the consent form for the main study (non-genetic 
components of the study) and the genetic component of the study.  Copies of both signed and 
dated consent forms must be given to the patient and the original filed at the study centre.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the 
patient understands that they may freely discontinue the genetic aspect of the study at any 
time. 

If modifications are made according to local requirements, the new version has to be approved 
by ICON.

Patient data protection 

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 
8.4 
The Master Informed Consent Form will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a 
separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and 
privacy legislation.  Pursuant to this wording, patients will authorise the collection, use and 
disclosure of their study data by the Investigator and by those persons who need that 
information for the purposes of the study. 

The Master Informed Consent Form will explain that study data will be stored in a computer 
database, maintaining confidentiality in accordance with national data legislation.  All data 
computer processed by AstraZeneca will be identified by subject number (randomisation 
code)/study code/initials. 

The Master Informed Consent Form will also explain that for data verification purposes, 
authorised representatives of ICON, AstraZeneca, a regulatory authority, an Ethics Committee 
may require direct access to parts of the hospital or practice records relevant to the study, 
including patients’ medical history. 

Reference to participation in this genetic research should not be recorded into the patients’ 
general medical records.  All notes should be kept within the clinical study records. 

Due to the exploratory nature of this genetic research, there will be no routine communication 
of results to patients.  AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to patients, 
any insurance company, any employer, their family members, general physician or any other 
third party, unless required to do so by law. 

Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identity of the patient, however, it must be recognised that there are exceptional 
circumstances where individuals may see both genetic data and a patient’s personal identifier, 
for example in the case of a medical emergency, when AstraZeneca and ICON Physicians and 
investigators might know the patients’ identity and might have access to the genetic data, or 
during regulatory audit where designated authorities must be permitted access to the relevant 
files.

Procedures in case of medical emergency 

9.2 
The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are 
available to handle medical emergencies during the study.  A medical emergency usually 
constitutes an SAE and should be reported as such, see Section 4.6.1.1. 

The treatment code may not be broken unless in an emergency situation when the appropriate 
management of the patient necessitates knowledge of the treatment allocation.  In such an 
emergency, the investigator will, if time and circumstances permit, consult with ICON on one 
of the telephone numbers listed in Section 9.1 prior to breaking the treatment code.  If the 
code is broken, the date, time and reason should be recorded and the investigator should sign 
the record.

Procedures in case of overdose 

Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance ZD4054   
Study Code D4320C00014  
Date 18 June 2007 
9.3 
There is currently no known antidote to ZD4054.  In the event of an overdose of study 
medication (more than 2 doses within a 24-hour period), appropriate symptomatic and 
supportive care should be given, and all details should be recorded.  Any untoward effects of 
an overdose should be reported as an AE or SAE, as appropriate, according to the reporting 
requirements detailed in Section 4.6.1.   

• 

• 

• 

• 

Use of study medication in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol should 
not be recorded in the eCRF as an AE of ‘Overdose’ unless there are associated 
symptoms or signs. 

An overdose with associated SAEs should be recorded as the SAE 
diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE forms in the eCRF. 

An overdose with associated non-serious AEs should be recorded as the AE 
diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE forms in the eCRF.  In addition, the 
overdose should be reported on the separate AZ “Clinical Study Overdose Report 
Form”. 

An overdose without associated symptoms should not be recorded as an AE in the 
eCRF.  The overdose should be reported on the separate AZ “Clinical Study 
Overdose Report Form”. 

Procedures in case of pregnancy 
Paternal exposure 

9.4 
9.4.1 
Pregnancy itself, in the patient’s partner, is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a 
suspicion that the investigational product under study may have interfered with the 
effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies 
(spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must 
be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study.   

All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages 
should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications 
should not be handled as AEs.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to ICON on the 
pregnancy outcomes report form.  These forms should be completed as soon as possible after 
it has been identified that the investigational product was received during pregnancy (via 
paternal exposure) and sent to the appropriate Drug Safety unit within 45 days.
