BIntroduction 
1.1 

treating  acute  myeloid 

BInduction Therapy 
leukemia  (AML)  employ  an 
BCurrently,  most  physicians 
anthracycline  plus  cytarabine  (“3+7  regimen”)  as  induction  therapy  (1).    Neither  the 
addition of other drugs such as 6-thioguanine (2) nor high-dose cytarabine (3,4) to this 
regimen  has  enhanced  the  complete  remission  (CR)  rate.    Despite  the  multitude  of 
studies using various drug combinations, no consensus exists as to which is best.  It has 
been  postulated  that  increasing  the  dose  of  anthracycline  with  cytokine  support  may 
improve complete remission rates and outcomes (5-7).  However, few AML randomized 
studies  have  been  completed  evaluating  the  utility  of  a  dose-intensified  regimen  in 
induction. 
BIn  large  multi-center  prospective  studies,  the  plateau  of  a  70%  CR  rate  has  not  been 
increased  by  any  regimen  to  date.    The  widely  used  combination  of  daunorubicin  45 
mg/m² intravenously daily for three days and cytarabine at 100 mg/m² intravenously by 
continuous infusion for seven days, yields a CR of 50 - 75% in adults.  In such patients, 
25  -  40  %  require  more  than  one  course  to  achieve  a  complete  remission  (8).  
Intensification  of  the  cytarabine  dose  increases  treatment-related  toxicity,  but  does  not 
yield  improved  outcomes (3).    In  a  number  of  trials  other  agents  such  as  idarubicin, 
amsacrine, and mitoxantrone (8-11) have been substituted for daunorubicin with similar 
or slightly better results.  However, the issue of dose-intensity equivalence of these drugs 
has clouded the results of these trials.   
BDose intensification of anthracycline may not only improve initial remission rates but may 
affect  the  outcome  of  post-remission  therapy  as  well  (5).    Studies  by  SWOG  (6)  and 
CALGB (7) suggest that dose intensification of daunorubicin is safe (4) and may improve 
both  induction  (7)  and  long-term  outcomes.    Sequential  studies  performed  by  SWOG 
noted improved CR rates in patients treated for three days with daunorubicin 70 mg/m² 
(12) versus 45 mg/m² (4).  Studies demonstrated a high CR rate when daunorubicin was 
given at a daily dose of 60mg/m² (13,14).  A CR rate of 81% was achieved by the use of 
daunorubicin  at  70 mg/m²  daily.    However,  the  patients  were  relatively  young  (median 
age was 31 years) (6).  The phase I CALGB 9621 study, used daunorubicin at doses of 
90-95 mg/m² without any increased toxicity and with CR rates as high as 79% (7).  These 
studies  were  sequential  rather  than  randomized  studies  which  suggested  an  improved 
response  to  intensified  daunorubicin  induction  therapy.    In  the  pediatric  setting,  the 
Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) demonstrated an improved long-term outcome when a 
time-intensive  induction  regimen  was  used  (15).    In  an  adult  population  less  than  60 
years old, no prospective studies have been performed comparing standard therapy to a 
more dose-intense anthracycline regimen. 
BThe EORTC-GIMMEMA-10 trial studied the impact of anthracycline dose on autologous 
transplant.    In  a  study  consisting  of  1,961  patients,  it  was  demonstrated  that  it  was 
feasible  to administer anthracycline (daunorubicin,  idarubicin and mitoxantrone) in  both 
induction  and  consolidation  without  excessive  cardiac  or  other  transplant-related 
complications.    Total  doses  of  300mg/m²  daunorubicin  (combined  induction  and 
consolidation) were well tolerated (16).  Furthermore, recent advances in the supportive 
care  permit  the  issue  of  dose  intensification  to  be  explored.    Patients  with  AML 
experienced improved outcomes using cytokine support with GM-CSF in induction (17).   
BThis trial will attempt to finally answer the question of dose-intensification of anthracycline 
prospectively in the adult AML induction setting.  We will determine whether dose

Bescalation  during  induction,  with  growth  factor  support,  can  improve  CR  rates  at 
acceptable  toxicity.    For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  standard  therapy  arm  will  be 
cytarabine 100 mg/m² IV daily as a continuous infusion for 7 days plus daunorubicin 45 
mg/m² IV daily for 3 days.  The dose intense therapy arm will consist of the same dose of 
cytarabine with daunorubicin 90 mg/m² IV each given daily for 3 days.  Patients in both 
arms will be allowed a second induction using daunorubicin 45 mg/m² IV daily for 3 days 
plus  cytarabine  100  mg/m²  IV  daily  as  a  continuous  infusion  for  7  days  to  attain  a 
complete remission. 
BPost Remission Therapy 
BIn the post-remission setting, controversy also exists as to the best treatment for patients 
who have attained a complete remission.  No consensus can be reached as to the length 
and  intensity  of  chemotherapy  given.    ECOG’s  (E4995)  study  demonstrated  an 
acceptable toxicity and outcome with the use of high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell 
support (18).  Other randomized studies have shown an advantage for using autologous 
transplant as consolidation in AML therapy (19,20).  Patients however, still may relapse 
after autotransplant, and further initiatives are needed to address the main drawback of 
this  therapy.    Such  a  strategy  is  to  incorporate  targeted  chemotherapy,  as  further 
consolidation, at a point of minimal residual disease, to evaluate its impact on autologous 
transplant. 
BThe proposed  post-remission therapy in this study  will  be based  on prognostic  factors.  
ECOG  (E3489)  demonstrated  that  patients  with  unfavorable  cytogenetics  fared  better 
with an allogeneic transplant compared to either autologous bone marrow transplant or 
standard chemotherapy (23).  Patients  with unfavorable prognostic factors (unfavorable 
cytogenetics,  elevated  WBC  count  at  diagnosis  >  100,000/μl)  will  be  allocated  to  an 
allogeneic transplant if an appropriate donor is available. 
BThose patients who are not poor risk or who do not have a suitable sibling matched donor 
(phenotypically  of  genotypically  HLA-matched 
family  member 
genotypically HLA-identical for one haplotype and mismatched for one locus (A, B, DR) 
on the other haplotype) for allogeneic transplant will be treated with high-dose cytarabine 
for two cycles.  Patients in remission will collect autologous peripheral blood stem cells 
(PBSC)  and 
intravenous  busulfan  and 
cyclophosphamide conditioning plus stem cell support.

BTransplant Considerations 
BECOG  study  (E3489)  demonstrated  that  a  single  course  of  intensive  consolidation 
chemotherapy  (ICC)  after  CR  provided  a  similar  disease-free  survival  and  improved 
overall survival when compared to autologous or allogeneic transplant (25).  Conclusions 
regarding  this  trial  were  limited  because  nearly  half  of  the  patients  randomized  to 
autologous  transplant  did  not  receive  the  prescribed  therapy.    Furthermore,  concerns 
about the use of a purged autologous bone marrow transplant arose from the study.  The 
use of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) purged bone marrow lead to a delay in 
recovery  of peripheral blood counts,  which contributed to a 14% mortality rate with the 
procedure.    In  a  recently  completed  ECOG  study  (E4995),  patients  in  remission  after 
induction were treated with intensified cytarabine consolidation, followed by autologous or 
allogeneic  transplant.    In  the  study,  there  was  no  transplant-related  mortality  in  those 
patients receiving an unpurged autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant.  Median 
survival  time  for  this  group  was  20.5  months  (18).    The  study  by  Harousseau  and 
colleagues (GOELM) showed as similar  outcome with consolidation chemotherapy  and 
autologous  stem  cell  transplant  (ASCT)  (21).  However,  the  treatment-related  mortality 
was approximately 7%.  In this trial, the ASCT reduced the relapse rate.  In the pediatric 
trial by Ravidindranath et al, no survival benefit for ASCT was observed, but again the 
treatment-related mortality was higher than would now occur (22). 
 
Other randomized trials have supported the use of autologous transplant as consolidation 
therapy in AML.  The MRC AML 10 study demonstrated a favorable outcome compared 
to ICC when an unpurged auto-transplant was used (19).  In a randomized trial by the 
EORTC  both  autologous  and  allogeneic 
intensive 
consolidation  chemotherapy  (20).    Even  for  patients  who  do  not  have  a  sibling  match, 
autologous transplant in first CR (CR1) is a viable alternative to matched unrelated donor 
transplant.    Combined  data  from  the  American  Bone  Marrow  Transplant  Registry 
(ABMTR), the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR), and the National  

transplant  were  superior

Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)  shows that patients treated with autologous transplant 
fared better than with a matched unrelated donor transplant.  Despite a higher  relapse 
rate in the autologous treatment arm, the low treatment-related mortality (8% vs. 44%, p< 
0.001)  contributed  to  an  improved  leukemia-  free  survival  at  3  years  (53%  vs.  41%, 
p<0.001)  (29).    Moreover,  in  the  long-term  follow-up  of  the  two  most  recent  ECOG 
transplant studies (18,28) there was no late relapse or mortality after two  years for the 
autologous  transplant  arm.    Patients  treated  solely  with  intensive  consolidation 
chemotherapy have had late relapses (22, 28, 30) and those who receive an allogeneic 
transplant  (sibling-matched,  MUD)  experienced  late  infections  and  graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD) which contributed to mortality. 
 
Autologous transplant is still considered an investigational treatment for AML. However, 
in the past decade improvements in supportive care including growth factors, antibiotics, 
and  peripheral  blood  stem  cell  transplants  (31),  plus  lower  treatment-related  mortality 
rates have lead to a wider acceptance of the autologous transplant approach.  Concerns 
about the procedure and difficulty obtaining insurance approval for the process hampered 
the autologous transplant arm of ECOG (E3489).  Forty-six percent (46%) of the patients 
assigned to autologous transplant did  not receive the prescribed therapy.  This current 
study will not address marrow or stem cell purging, which also hindered the above study.  
The  removal  of  the  barriers  to  transplant  and  improved  techniques  will  allow  a  new 
standard for autologous transplant to be set.  These changes, plus the latest autologous 
PBSC  transplant  outcomes,  emphasize  the  need  to  revisit  autologous  transplant  as  a 
consolidation therapy in AML. 
 
Morbidity and mortality of autologous transplant has significantly improved particularly for 
patients  in  first  remission  (CR1)  (32).    Studies  have  shown  superiority  of  autologous 
transplant  to  chemotherapy  (20),  allogeneic  transplant  (33)  and  unrelated  donor 
transplants (28).  Improvement in WBC recovery by the use of peripheral blood stem cells 
has  led  to  a  decrease  in  transplant-related  mortality  (TRM)  (31).    Improvements  in  the 
conditioning  regimens  have  also  contributed  to  better  outcomes.    Oral  busulfan  and 
cyclophosphamide  have  been  used  as  a  pre-transplant  conditioning  regimen  in  acute 
leukemia.    It  is  an  acceptable  alternative  to  total  body  irradiation  (TBI)  containing 
conditioning  regimens  for  patients  with  early  disease  (32).    The  major  toxicity  of  this 
combination  appeared  to  be  hepatic  toxicity.    A  parenteral  preparation  of  busulfan  has 
been  used  extensively  in  clinical  transplant  trials  and  appears  to  possess  considerably 
less potential for hepatic toxicity than the oral form.  Intravenous busulfan (Busulfex) and 
cyclophosphamide  has  been  used  in  high-risk  AML  and  myelodysplastic  syndrome 
(MDS)  patients.    Disease-free  survival  at  2  years  was  31%  in  the  high  risk  AML 
population.  Toxicity with this regimen was minimal in this group (35).  In a phase II trial 
using  intravenous  busulfan  and  cyclophosphamide,  there  was  no  treatment-related 
mortality in the autologous (BM and  PBSC) transplant setting (36). The combination of 
Busulfex 0.8 mg/kg IV over 2 hours every 6 hours for 16 doses and cyclophosphamide 60 
mg/kg/day will be used in this proposed study. 
 
Recent  data  from  Wyeth-Ayerst  database  indicated  that  there  is  a  small  incidence  of 
hepatic  toxicity  associated  with  the  administration  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  when 
given alone and  when given before ASCT.  The data show that the incidence of a veno-
occlusive disease-like  syndrome is 16% when at least 2 doses of 9mg/m2 are given in 
relapsed  patients.    The  mortality  rate  in  this  population  is  reported  to  be  8%(37).   We 
must presume that the incidence and mortality rate will be less in this protocol when the 
drug is given to previously untreated patients and once a single dose of a reduced dose

of 6 mg/m2 will be administered.  This protocol  will determine the toxicity in a carefully 
monitored way. 
BCorrelative Studies 
BCorrelative studies  with cytogenetics, fluorescent  in-situ  hybridization (FISH), Flt3 gene 
duplication and multiplex PCR analysis will be obtained pre-treatment, post-induction and 
prior  to  autologous  PBSCT  to  determine  the  impact  of  gemtuzumab-ozogamicin  on 
residual  disease.  We  will  also  investigate  the  issue  of  angiogenesis  and  its  biological 
impact  on  the  disease  in  the  induction,  consolidation  and  post-transplant  setting.  
Information  from  this  trial  will  guide  the  design  of  future  ECOG-ACRIN  studies  using 
angiogenesis inhibitors and may help to further advance the therapy of AML. 
1.5.1  Karyotype and FISH Studies 

At least two clinical trials have attempted to define chromosome abnormalities as 
favorable, intermediate and unfavorable in patients with untreated AML.  In one 
clinical trial (40), the favorable risk group included inv(16), t(16;16), del(16q) or 
t(15;17),  or  t(8;21)  with  or  without  other  chromosome  abnormalities.    The 
intermediate group included normal karyotype, 11q23 abnormalities, +8, del(9q), 
del(7q), +21, +21 and all other chromosome abnormalities.  The unfavorable risk 
group  included  del(6q),  -6,  -7,  abnormal  (3q),  complex  karyotypes  (5  or  more 
chromosome abnormalities), t(9;22), and t(6;9).  In a more recent clinical trial (7), 
the  favorable  group  of  chromosome  abnormalities  included  inv(16),  t(16;16), 
del(16q) or t(15;17)  with or without other chromosome abnormalities,  or t(8;21) 
without  either  del(9q)  or  part  of  a  complex  karyotype.    The  intermediate  risk 
category included +8, -Y, +6, del(12p) or normal karyotype.  The unfavorable risk 
category  included  one  or  more  of  -5/del(5q),  -7/del(7q),  inv(3q),  abnormal  11q, 
20q, or 21q, del(9q), t(6;9), t(9;22), abnormal 17p or complex karyotype defined 
as  3  or  more  abnormalities.    These  studies  illustrate  the  value  of  using 
cytogenetic risk categories to treat patients with AML. 

1.5.2  Flt3 Internal Tandem Duplication (ITD) and Immunophenotypic Features 

Flt3 gene belongs to the family of class III tyrosine kinase receptors which also 
includes  c-kit,  c-fms  and  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor  (PDGF)  receptors.  
While  Flt3  is  preferentially  expressed  on  hematopoietic  stem cells,  its  ligand  is 
synthesized by bone marrow stroma cells.  The interaction between Flt3 and its 
ligand  results  in  the  activation  of  the  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  and  receptor 
autophosphorylation.  The phosphorylated receptor induces cell proliferation and 
inhibits apoptosis. 
Internal tandem duplications (ITD) involving sequences in exons 11 and 12 of the 
Flt3 gene are found in 15 to 27 percent of pediatric and adult patients with AML 
and  are  prevalent  in  patients  who  lack  other  cytogenetic  or  molecular  lesions.  
Flt3 gene mutations are therefore the most frequent somatic mutations in AML.  
Flt3 ITD result in constitutive receptor tyrosine kinase activation.  Available data  
suggest  that  the  presence  of    Flt3  ITD  provides  a  powerful  prognostic  marker, 
particularly in patients under 60 years of age.  Flt3 ITD  appears to be the most 
significant  factor  predicting  for  disease-free  and  overall  survival  but,  in  most 
studies, not for achievement of complete remission (41-48).  Most importantly, in 
multivariate analyses,  the prognostic significance of Flt3 ITD  is  independent of 
conventional cytogenetic findings.  DNA will be prepared from mononuclear cells 
at the time of study entry and analyzed by genomic polymerase chain reaction

and  sequence  analysis  of  the  Flt3  gene,  following  published  protocols.    The 
presence  of  Flt3  ITD  will  be  retrospectively  correlated  with  outcome.    Flt3  ITD 
have  been  used  as  a  marker  for  monitoring  minimal  residual  disease  in  AML 
(48).  We  will  take  the  same  approach  in  patients  positive  for  Flt3  ITD  at 
diagnosis.   
While  there  is  a  strong  association  between  leukocytosis  and  presence  of  Flt3 
ITD,  there  is  no  association  with  FAB  subtype.    To  date,  correlations  between 
Flt3 ITD and immunophenotypic features of the leukemic cells are not available.  
Given  its  high  frequency  in  AML,  it  is  one  of  our  goals  to  discover  an 
immunophenotypic  surrogate  marker  for  Flt3  ITD  using  patients  entered  on 
E1900.  This approach has met with success in E2993, the ECOG Phase III ALL 
study.    In  patients  on  E2993,  extensive  flow  cytometric  immunophenotyping  in 
ECOG’s immunophenotyping reference laboratory (Dr. E. Paietta) demonstrated 
that  expression  of  CD25,  the  alpha  chain  of  the  interleukin-2  receptor,  on 
leukemic  lymphoblasts  serves  as  a  surrogate  marker  for  BCR/ABL  transcripts, 
the molecular equivalent of the t(9;22) (49).  Similar attempts have been made by 
other investigators to detect surrogate antigen markers for the TEL/AML1 fusion 
gene, the most frequent molecular anomaly in childhood ALL (50).  To be able to 
predict  for  the  presence  of  a molecular  lesion  by  flow  cytometry  offers  a  quick 
and inexpensive tool which may replace or complement molecular studies when 
they are inconclusive or not feasible. 

1.5.3  Leukemia-Specific Fusion Genes and Polymerase Chain Reaction 

Multiplex  reverse  transcriptase  polymerase  chain  reaction  (RT-PCR)  for  the 
detection  of  a  multitude  of  leukemia-specific  fusion  genes  has  been  previously 
described  (51,52).    It  is  not  only  a  complimentary  technique  to  karyotype 
analysis, particularly if chromosome preparations fail  but, more importantly, has 
been shown to discover submicroscopic aberrations and masked translocations 
in patients with normal karyotypes by standard cytogenetics.  Given that in most 
AML  trials,  40-50%  of  patients  present  with  a  normal  karyotype  by  standard 
cytogenetics, detecting molecular markers resulting from cryptic translocations by 
this multiplex PCR test or Flt3 gene mutations, as described above, are needed 
to further subclassify these patients in terms of prognosis. 
In  a  clinical  trial,  like  E1900,  in  which  important  post-remission  questions  are 
asked,  establishing  the  presence  of  minimal  residual  disease  by  all  available 
means is of utmost importance.  We will, therefore, use PCR for initially identified 
molecular  markers  in  addition  to  Flt3  ITD  and  immunologic  testing  to  monitor 
patients during the course of post-remission therapies.  Patients found positive 
for  one  of  28  possible  molecular  lesions  (inc.:  inv(16),  t(8;21),    several 
translocations involving 11q23, t(6;9), t(9;22)) by either standard cytogenetics or 
multiplex PCR   will be subsequently followed after attainment of remission and 
prior to autologous transplant and post transplant to evaluate the response to the 
various therapies. 

1.5.4  Angiogenesis 

We will also investigate the issue of angiogenesis and its biological impact on the 
disease in induction, consolidation and post-transplant.  Information from this will 
guide  the  design  of  future  ECOG-ACRIN  studies  using  angiogenesis  inhibitors 
and may help to further advance the therapy of AML.

1.6 

Vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  has  been  implicated  as  a  paracrine 
(54)  and  autocrine  (55)  stimulator  of  AML  and  MDS.    VEGF  in  addition  to 
promoting  angiogenesis  is  a  powerful  stimulator  of  FLT1  and  KDR.    VEGF  is 
present in leukemic cells and is secreted by these cells.  Increased angiogenesis, 
based  on  microvascular  staining,  has  been  noted  in  bone  marrow  samples  of 
AML  patients  (56).    Angiogenesis  mediated  by  VEGF  has  been  noted  in  APL.  
Treatment with ATRA and other anti-VEGF’s abrogated this effect (57).  Another 
study  correlated  higher  VEGF  levels  in  blasts  with  a  poorer  prognosis  (58)  for 
patients with AML 
Bone  marrow  aspirates  and  biopsies  will  be  taken  prior  to  therapy,  post-
induction,  consolidation  and  transplant.    Blinded  correlation  of  microvessel 
density  pre-  and  post-therapy  will  be  compared  to  the  response  rates  and 
duration of response in the patients. 

BPurpose of this Trial 
BThis trial will address important questions in both the induction and consolidation phases 
of therapy for patients with newly diagnosed AML. At the termination of this large trial, we 
will  determine  if  the  intensification  of  daunorubicin  in  the  induction  improves  complete 
response rates.  The dose intensification of daunorubicin is considered an experimental 
strategy and will be carefully studied in this clinical trial in a monitored way. Data on the 
upfront allogeneic transplantation of high-risk AML patients also will be gathered. 
BAs of July 30, 2007, 553 patients were randomized to one of two induction regimens on 
this trial. 254 patients have proceeded to the consolidation phase randomization and 106 
patients have completed transplant. Gemtuzumab-ozogamicin in consolidation was well 
tolerated,  with  only  three  case  of  hepatic  veno-occlusive  disease  (VOD)  in  57  patients 
receiving the drug. There were no cases of VOD post-transplant in either group. The two 
groups (119 eligible patients in group A, 124 eligible patients in group B) were compared 
for DFS based on the intention to treat (ITT) and those receiving transplant. 11 ineligible 
patients  were  excluded  from  those  analyses.  Results  of  the  planned  interim  analysis 
demonstrated the DFS was 20.0 vs. 19.5months (p= 0.94) and 22.2 vs. 24.9 (p=0.74) on 
the  ITT  and  transplant  comparisons,  respectively.  Based  on  these  results  the  use  of 
gemtuzumab-ozogamicin  has  been  discontinued  for  the  remainder  of  the  trial.  As  of 
October  4,  2007  all  patients  in  the  intermediate  and  low  risk  groups  will  receive 
cytarabine consolidation followed by PBSC harvest and autologous transplantation.

BGender and Ethnicity 
BEntry to this study is open to both men and women, and to persons of any racial or ethnic 
group.    Previous  ECOG  studies  in  this  patient  population  enrolled  53%  men,  47% 
women, 84% white, 8% black and 8% other from ECOG institutions.  We anticipate that 
entry of women and minorities to this study will show similar proportions. 
BWe are aware of no data  that  would lead us to expect differential  treatment effects by 
gender  and  ethnicity  and  therefore  have  not  incorporated  separate  accrual  goals  for 
these  subgroups.    When  the  study  is  completed,  we  will  do  subgroup  analyses  to 
investigate and document any treatment differences in gender or ethnicity subgroups.

Induction Therapy and Premedications 
BNOTE:  Doses to be calculated using actual body weight. BSA cap 2.5 for daunorubicin. 
5.1.1 

Initial Considerations 
5.1.1.1  Patients  should  begin  treatment  with  Allopurinol  300  mg/day  orally.  
Reversible  abnormalities  of  renal  or  metabolic  function  should  be 
treated  aggressively  and  corrected  prior  to  institution  of  therapy.  
Immediate  measures  to  diagnose  and  begin  treatment  of  infections 
should be instituted prior to induction therapy. 

5.1.1.2  Patients  with  high  circulating  blast  cell  counts  >  50,000/μl,  should  be 
given Hydroxyurea 750 mg/m² (or more) orally every 6 hours until the 
absolute blast count falls < 50,000/μl. 

5.1.1.3  Patients  with  M4  or  M5  disease  and  have  CNS  signs  or  symptoms 
should  have  a  lumbar  puncture  once  blasts  have  cleared  from  the 
peripheral blood smear. 
5.1.1.3.1 

5.1.1.3.2 

Guidelines  for  therapy  of  CNS  disease:  Twice  weekly 
until clearance of blasts from the CSF then monthly x 6 
months. 
Methotrexate 12 mg IT, with Leucovorin rescue 10 to 20 
mg PO every six hours x 6 doses starting 24 hours after 
therapy or Cytarabine 30mg/m² IT.

5.1.3.1  Bone marrow aspirate will be performed on days 12-14 of therapy (day 
1  being  the  first  day  of  chemotherapy).    Patients  who  fail  to  achieve 
complete aplasia of the marrow are eligible to receive a second cycle of 
induction (Section 5.1.2.3). 
BPatients who have evidence of bone marrow aplasia will begin cytokine 
support. Patients will receive GM-CSF at 250 mcg/m2 SC/IV. Cytokine 
therapy  should  be  given  through  recovery  of  blood  counts  (ANC  > 
1,000/ μl). Dose may be rounded to closest vial size. The recovery is 
expected to take 25-30 days from the initiation of chemotherapy. 

5.1.4  Dose Modification for Induction Cycle 2 (If Necessary)

5.1.5  Supportive Care Post-induction Therapy 

Patients should receive an oral Quinolone, Fluconozole, and Acyclovir to prevent 
infection once the ANC drops below 1000. 

BPost-Remission Therapy 
 
BPatients with appropriate donors who are considered poor risk for autologous transplant 
as  defined  in  Sections  3.2.2  and  11.1  will  be  allocated  to  allogeneic  transplant  as 
described in Section 5.2.1.  Patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics and appropriate 
donors may, at the physician’s and patient’s discretion, proceed to allogeneic transplant 
and remain on study 
BCytogenetic risk status will be determined by central analysis.  Prestudy karyotypes, if not 
submitted during induction, must be submitted within 2-3 weeks of documentation of CR.  
See Section 11.0 for submission requirements and cytogenetic risk categories. The risk 
group will be determined by the ECOG-ACRIN cytogenetics committee and forwarded to 
the EGOG registration desk. 
BPatients  who  do  not  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  for  allogeneic  transplant  as  noted  in 
Section 3.2.2 and Section 11.1 will be assigned to consolidation therapy and autologous 
transplant as described in Section 5.3.  If a patient with favorable or unknown risk status 
and an appropriate sibling donor wishes to proceed to allogeneic transplant, patient must 
discontinue protocol therapy and receive treatment off study. 
5.2.1  Allogeneic Transplant  

5.2.1.1  Patients  must  have  a  suitable  donor,  phenotypically  of  genotypically 
HLA-matched  family  member  or  family  member  genotypically  HLA-
identical for one haplotype and mismatched for one locus (A,B,DR) on 
the  other  haplotype.    Donors  must  be  age  65  or  less  and  have  no 
physical  or  psychological  reasons  to  be  excluded  for  donating  bone 
marrow or peripheral blood stem cells. 

5.2.1.2  Patients  allocated  to  allogeneic  transplant  will  proceed  directly  to 

transplant.  They will undergo the therapy no sooner than one month

guidelines in Section 3.2.2 are met. 

5.2.1.3  Those patients not felt to be poor risk for transplant or who do not have 
a suitable sibling match as above may be assigned to the autologous 
transplant. 

5.2.1.4  Selection of Allogeneic Transplant Center 

Eligible  patients  will  be  referred  to  one  of  the  approved  allogeneic 
Blood and Marrow transplant institutions.  Arrangements will be made 
by contacting the marrow transplant patient coordinator at the chosen 
institution.  If necessary, contact the ECOG-ACRIN Operations Office, 
(617) 632-3610, to obtain a current listing of the BMT coordinators. 

5.2.1.5  Transplant Regimen (Suggested) 

Conditioning regimen will consist of: 

Busulfan 0.8 mg/kg dose IV every 6 hours for 16 doses on days -7,-6,-5, -4 
Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg in D5W in Normal Salines 250-500 ml IV over l hour on days -3, and- 2. 
Mesna uroprotection 25 mg /kg IV 15 minutes prior to cyclophosphamide then 25 mg/kg IV Q 6 hours on 
days -3,-2 and -1. 

5.2.1.6 

See  Section  5.3.5.3  for  medical  management  during  conditioning 
therapy. 
Infusion Stem Cells 
Infusion  of  stem  cells  is  to  proceed  as  described  below  or  per 
insitutional standards. 
See Section 5.2.1.7 for treatment supportive care. 
5.2.1.6.1 

5.2.1.6.2 

Stem Cells: Cryopreserved stem cells are rapidly thawed 
at  37C  and  immediately  infused  36-48  hours  after  the 
last dose of Cyclophosphamide. 
PBSC 
Infusion:  The  cells  are  not  washed  before 
reinfusion,  and  the  osmolality  of  the  cell  suspension 
requires  the  use  of  a  flowing  central  venous  catheter.  
Before 
reinfusion  of  PBSC,  hydration  must  be 
maintained  to  have  an  output  of  at  least  3  cc/kg/hour.  
Emergency  drugs  (Benadryl,  epinephrine,  Solu-Medrol) 
in appropriate doses must be at the bedside.  Baseline 
vital signs, forced vital capacity and EKG are recorded.  
Fifteen  minutes  prior  to  administration  of  the  thawed 
PBSC, the patient is to receive: 
50 ml of 25% mannitol solution IV

GVHD Prophylaxis 
Any  of  several  GVHD  prophylaxis  regimens  will  be 
acceptable.    However,  two  approaches  are  specifically 
unacceptable including deletion of all GVHD prophylaxis 
and the use of T-cell depletion techniques.  In general, 
we  would  recommend  using  either  cyclosporine  or 
tacrolimus combined with methotrexate. 
Cyclosporine  Administration:  Cyclosporine  is  started  on 
the  day  before  marrow  infusion  (day  -1)  at  a  loading 
dose  of  5  mg/kg/day  (2.5  mg/kg  BID)  for  two  doses 
followed by on day 0 a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (1.5 mg/kg 
BID)  and  infused  over  a  period  of  1-4  hours.    IV 
Cyclosporine can be discontinued when patient starts to 
eat  and  PO  Cyclosporine  substituted  at  a  dose  of  12.5 
mg/kg/day  in  two  divided  doses  (6.25 mg/kg  each).  
Monitor  blood  concentrations  to  keep  in  therapeutic 
range  per  institutional  guidelines.  Unless  toxicity  is 
encountered,  Cyclosporine  can  be  continued  at  the 
same  dose  until  day  100,  after  which  the  drug  can  be 
reduced by  5% per  week and discontinued on day  180 
after grafting. 
Tacrolimus Administration: Tacrolimus will be started on 
the day before marrow infusion (day -1) at a dose of 0.03 
mg/kg/day  intravenously  infused  continuously  over  a 
period  of  24  hours.    IV  tacrolimus  can  be  discontinued 
when patient starts to eat and PO tacrolimus substituted 
at  a  dose  four  times  the  IV  dose  (0.12  mk/kg)  in  two 
divided doses.  Monitor blood concentrations to keep in 
therapeutic  range  per  institutional  guidelines.  Unless 
toxicity  is  encountered,  tacrolimus  can  be  continued  at 
the same dose until day 100, after which the drug can be 
reduced by and discontinued on day 180 after grafting. 
Methotrexate  Administration:    Methotrexate  is  to  be 
combined with Cyclosporine or tacrolimus at doses of 15 
mg/m² on day 1, and 10 mg/m² on days 3, 6 and 11.

in 

5.3.3.2  PBSC Collection:  Patients will have PBSC mobilized upon recovery of 
the  counts  (ANC  >  1000)  from  the  second  cycle  of  post-remission 
therapy. They will receive G-CSF (filgrastim) 10 mcg/kg SC daily (may 
be given in divided doses) for 4 days. Peripheral blood CD34 cells will 
be used to monitor the initiation of the harvest starting the fifth day. If 
peripheral CD34+ counts are > 10/μl then harvest may begin. Patients 
will  have  collection  of  the  PBSC  by  a  leukapheresis  procedure.  If 
peripheral  venous  access  is  adequate,  the  patient  may  have  the 
collection  catheters  inserted  in  the  antecubital  fossa  for  collection. 
Patients  with  the  indwelling  catheters  may  use  the  catheter  as  their 
venous access. Patients without adequate venous access may have a 
temporary silastic catheter placed for the procedure. Centers have the 
option  of  standard  or  large-volume  leukapheresis  as  their  method  of 
collection.  Upon  inadequate  collection  (<1.0  x  106  CD34+  nucleated 
cells/kg)  of  PBSC  the  patient  is  to  discontinue  protocol  therapy.  A 
repeat  collection  is  allowed  to  attain  the  minimum  amount  of  CD34+ 
positive cells required for autologous PBSCT. 2x106 CD34+ nucleated 
cells/kg are suggested as a minimum for transplantation. Patients who 
collect  less  than  this  may  be  transplanted;  however,  only  if  the 
collection was greater than 1 x 106 CD34+nucleated cells/kg. 

5.3.3.3  PBSC Processing 

The peripheral blood stem cell product obtained from the leukapheresis 
procedure will not be filtered nor will the buffy coat be extracted.  The 
product will have the appropriate cell measurements performed then be 
diluted  in  a  1:1  volume  ratio  with  a  freezing  solution  containing  80% 
autologous  plasma  with  20%  DMSO 
final  nucleated  cell 
concentration of 2 x 108 NC/ml.  The final DMSO concentration is 10%.  
The cells are cyropreserved in 50-100 ml aliquots. The frozen cells are 
stored in the vapor or liquid phase of liquid nitrogen. All processing of 
PBSC  will  be  in  accordance  with  good  blood  bank  manufacturing 
practices.

after last dose of Cyclophosphamide. 
PBSC  Reinfusion:  The  cells  are  not  washed  before 
reinfusion,  and  the  osmolality  of  the  cell  suspension 
requires  the  use  of  a  flowing  central  venous  catheter.  
Before  reinfusion  of  autologous  PBSC,  hydration  must 
be maintained to have an output of at least 3 cc/kg/hour.  
Emergency  drugs  (Benadryl,  epinephrine,  Solu-Medrol) 
in appropriate doses must be at the bedside.  Baseline 
vital signs, forced vital capacity and EKG are recorded.  
Fifteen  minutes  prior  to  administration  of  the  thawed 
PBSC, the patient is to receive: 
- 50 ml of 25% mannitol solution IV 
- 50 mg of diphenhydramineIV 
- 250 mg of hydrocortisone IV

Phenytoin  or  clonazepam  may  be  given  per 
institutional standards. 

Suggested Dosing: 
Phenytoin (Dilantin): Two days prior to Busulfan therapy 
start  Dilantin  15  mg/kg  oral  loading  dose  followed  by 
5 mg/kg  orally  daily  for  6  days.    Check  Dilantin  levels

Venous  Access:    Double  or  triple  lumen  indwelling 
silastic catheters are required before initiating therapy. 
Mucosal Evaluation and Care:  Mucositis is expected to 
be  severe. 
In  patients  with  poor  oral  hygiene, 
consultation  by  Oral  Surgeon  is  strongly  recommended 
prior to initiating therapy since multiple dental extractions 
may  be  necessary.    Stomatitis  and  esophagitis  due  to 
herpes  virus  may  be  confused  with  drug-induced 
mucositis. 
Nutritional  Evaluation  and  Therapy:    Malnutrition  is 
expected  due  to  lack  of  food  intake  after  treatment.  
Intravenous  alimentation  should  be  initiated  until  oral 
food intake becomes adequate as recovery ensues. 
Blood  Component  Support:    All  blood  products  will  be 
irradiated  (>1500  rads)  to  prevent  GVHD.    Packed  red

fever 
(>38.2C)  after  appropriate  cultures  (blood  x  3  sets,

based on the pattern of sensitivity of organisms at each 
institution, but probably should include as a minimum, a 
third  generation  cephalosporin  or  semi-synthetic 
penicillin  (e.g.,    Mezlocillin,  Ticarcillin  or  Pipercillin).

other  lipid  formulation,  caspofungin  or  vorconazole  IV) 
may  be  used  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  (66). 
Diffuse  pulmonary  infiltrates  occur  frequently  and  can 
present  difficult  diagnostic  problems. 
  Whenever 
possible  a  tissue  diagnosis  should  be  obtained  by 
bronchoscopy or open lung biopsy.  In the absence of a 
tissue  diagnosis,  empiric  antibiotic  therapy  should  be 
expanded  to  include  potentially  treatable  etiologies, 
including  Erythromycin  (for  Legionnaire’s),  TMP/SMZ 
(high-dose regimen for presumed pneumocystis) as well 
as Acyclovir and Amphotericin B, if  these agents are not 
already in use. 
Management of Fluid Accumulation 
After therapy, patients may experience a “capillary-leak” 
syndrome  leading  to  extravascular  fluid  retention.    The 
peak  of  weight  gain  occurs  2  weeks  after  therapy  and 
then resolves.  Careful attention to the patient’s weight is 
necessary and intensive forced diuresis should be used 
to  prevent  excess  fluid  retention.    Furosemide  may  be 
used as needed.

BAdverse Event Reporting Requirements 
5.4.1  Purpose 

Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as 
well  as  those  who  will  enroll  in  future  studies  using  similar  agents.  Adverse 
events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial (please 
refer to the E1900 Forms Packet for the list of forms with directions for routine 
adverse event reporting).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported 
in  an  expedited  manner  for  more  timely  monitoring  of  patient  safety  and  care. 
The following sections provide information about expedited reporting.

the  adverse  event 

investigational  or  commercial  agent;  2) 
the  grade  (severity), 

Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the 
the 
patient  has 
characteristics  of 
the 
relationship 
the  prior  experience 
(expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) 
whether or not  hospitalization  or prolongation of hospitalization  was associated 
with the event. 
Commercial  agents  are  those  agents  not  provided  under  an  IND  but  obtained 
instead from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, 
may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial. 
Steps  to  determine  if  an  adverse  event  is  to  be  reported  in  an  expedited 
manner: 
Step 1:  Identify the type of event: The descriptions and grading scales found in 
the  revised  NCI  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE) 
version  4.0  will  be  utilized  for  AE  reporting.   All  appropriate  treatment  areas 
should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov). 
Step 2:  Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0. 
Step 3:  Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy 
(investigational or commercial). Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, 
Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite. 
Step 4:  Determine  the  prior  experience  of  the  adverse  event.  Expected  events 
are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of 
the agent. An adverse  event is considered  unexpected, for expedited reporting 
purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is NOT 
listed in:  
•  Arm A, B, C and E – the drug package insert or protocol 
Step 5:  Review  Section  5.4.6 
for  E1900  and/or  ECOG-ACRIN  specific 
requirements  for  expedited  reporting  of  specific  adverse  events  that  require 
special monitoring.   
NOTE:  For  general  questions  regarding  expedited  reporting  requirements, 
please contact the AEMD Help Desk at aemd@tech-res.com or 301-897-
7497. 

5.4.3  Reporting Procedures 

This study requires that expedited adverse event reporting use CTEP’s Adverse 
Event Reporting System (CTEP-AERS).  CTEP’s guidelines for CTEP-AERS can 
be  found  at  http://ctep.cancer.gov.    A  CTEP-AERS  report  must  be  submitted 
electronically  to  ECOG-ACRIN  and  the  appropriate  regulatory  agencies  via  the 
CTEP-AERS Web-based application located at http://ctep.cancer.gov. 
In the rare event when Internet connectivity is disrupted a 24-hour notification is 
to be made by telephone to the AE Team at ECOG-ACRIN (617-632-3610) and 
the FDA (1-800-FDA-1088). 
An  electronic  report  MUST  be  submitted  immediately  upon  re-establishment  of 
internet connection. 
Supporting  and  follow  up  data:    Any  supporting  or  follow  up  documentation 
must  be  faxed  to  ECOG-ACRIN  (617  632  2990),  Attention:  AE  within  48-72 
hours.  In addition, supporting or follow up documentation must be faxed to the 
FDA (800-332-0178) in the same timeframe.

5.4.4  When to report an event in an expedited manner 

When an adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit a full CTEP-AERS 
report within the timeframes outlined in Section 5.4.6. 
NOTE:  Adverse  events  that  meet  the  reporting  requirements  in  Section  5.4.6 
and occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol treatment must be 
reported  on  an  expedited  adverse  event  report  form  (using  CTEP-
AERS). For any adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the 
last  dose  of  treatment,  only  those  that  have  an  attribution  of  possibly, 
probably,  or  definitely  AND  meet  the  reporting  requirements  in  Section 
5.4.6 must be reported on an expedited adverse event report form (using 
CTEP-AERS). 

5.4.5  Other recipients of adverse event reports 

Adverse  events  determined  to  be  reportable  must  also  be  reported  by  the 
institution,  according  to  the  local  policy  and  procedures,  to  the  Institutional 
Review Board responsible for oversight of the patient. 
The  drug  supporter  is  obliged  to  forward  reported  AEs  to  the  FDA.    A  drug 
supporter  representative  may  call  a  site  for  additional  information  regarding  a 
serious adverse event.  Any additional written AE information requested by the 
drug  supporter  MUST  be  submitted  to  BOTH  ECOG-ACRIN  and  the  drug 
supporter.

BMeasurement of Effect 
6.1 

BComplete Remission (CR) 
BRequires that all of the following be present: 
6.1.1  Peripheral Blood Counts 

Rev. 4/05 

6.1.1.1  Neutrophil count > 1.0 x 109 /L.  
6.1.1.2  Platelet count > 100 x  109 /L. 
6.1.1.3  Reduced  hemoglobin  concentration  or  hematocrit  has  no  bearing  on 

remission status. 

6.1.1.4  Leukemic blasts must not be present in the peripheral blood. 

Rev. 4/05 

6.1.2  Bone Marrow Aspirate and Biopsy 

6.1.2.1  Maturation of all cell lines must be present. 

6.1.2.1.1 
6.1.2.1.2 

< 5% blasts 
Auer rods must not be detectable. 

6.1.3  Extramedullary leukemia, such as CNS or soft tissue involvement, must not be 

present. 

6.2 

6.3 

Rev. 4/05 

6.4 

BPartial Remission (PR) 
6.2.1  Requires that all of the criteria for complete remission be satisfied except that the 

bone marrow may contain > 5% blasts but < 25% blasts. 
If all other criteria for CR are met, then a value of > 5% blasts with Auer rods or 
abnormal morphology is considered a partial remission. 

6.2.2 

BRelapse 
Relapse following complete remission is defined as: 
6.3.1  Peripheral Blood Counts 

6.3.1.1  Reappearance of blasts in the blood 

6.3.2  Bone Marrow Aspirate & Biopsy 

6.3.2.1  Presence of > 5% blasts, not attributable to another cause (e.g., bone 

marrow regeneration). 
If there are no circulating blasts and the bone marrow contains 5% to 
20%  blasts,  then  a  repeat  bone  marrow  performed  >  1  week  later 
documenting more than 5% blasts is necessary to meet the criteria for 
relapse. 
BDefinitions for Response 
Overall survival (OS) is determined from the time of registration on the trial to the time of 
death due either disease or toxicity from the disease. 
Relapse-free  survival  (RFS)  will  be  defined  from  the  time  of  the  confirmation  of  a 
complete remission via biopsy to the relapse of the disease as defined in Section 6.3.

BBusulfan 
8.6.1  Other Names 

Myleran, Busulfex BSF. 

8.6.2  Classification 

Alkylating agent. 

8.6.3  Mode of Action 

Busulfan  acts  as  a  polyfunctional-alkylating  agent  and  appears  to  interact  with 
cellular thiol groups as well as nucleic acids. It causes a small amount of DNA 
cross linking and a large amount of DNA-protein crosslinking. strands. It is cell-
cycle nonspecific. 

8.6.4  Storage and Stability 

Tablets:  Store at room temperature in well sealed containers. 
Parenteral:    Unopened  ampules  are  stable  until  the  date  indicated  on  the 
package  when  stored  under  refrigeration  between  2  and  8C  (36-46F).  DO 
NOT FREEZE. Ampules may NOT be stored at temperatures higher than 26C 
(80ºF) for longer than 24 hours. Orphan Medical, Inc. will provide as necessary, 
date  extensions  and  expiration  dates  for  each  lot  in  a  separate  letter  to  the 
pharmacy. DO NOT use if the solution is cloudy or if particulates are present. 
Busulfan  injection  diluted  in  0.9%  sodium  chloride  for  injection,  USP  or  5% 
Dextrose injection, USP is stable at room temperature (25ºC) for up to 8 hours, 
but  the  infusion  must  be  completed  by  that  time.  Busulfan  injection  diluted  in 
0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP is stable at refrigerated conditions (2-
8C) for up to 12 hours, but the infusion must be completed by that time 

8.6.5  Dose Specifics 

For intravenous injection, busulfan is routinely administered at 0.8mg/kg IV over 
2 hours every six (6)  hours on  days  –7, -6, -5, -4 for a total of 16 doses. See 
protocol for specific doses required. 

8.6.6  Preparation 

Prepare the dose of busulfan as follows: 
Busulfan injection must be diluted prior to use with either 0.9% sodium chloride 
injection, USP (normal saline) or 5% dextrose injection, USP (D5W). The diluent 
quantity should be 10 times the volume of busulfan injection,  ensuring that the 
final concentration is approximately greater or equal to 0.5 mg/ml.  Calculation of 
the  dose  for  a  70  kg  patient  receiving  0.8  mg/kg  busulfan  per  dose  would  be 
performed as follows: 

(70 kg patient) (0.8mg/kg) divided by 6 mg/ml = 9.3 ml busulfan injection 
(56 mg total dose) 
To prepare the final solution for infusion, add 9.3 ml of busulfan injection 
to 93 ml of diluent (normal saline or D5W) as calculated below: 
(9.3 ml busulfan injection)(10) = 93 ml of normal saline or D5W plus the 
9.3 ml of busulfan injection to  yield a final concentration of busulfan  of 
0.54 mg/ml (9.3 ml x 6 mg/ml divided by 102.3 ml = 0.54 mg/ml).

not contain normal saline or D5W.  Always add the busulfan to the diluent, not 
the diluent to the busulfan injection. Mix thoroughly by inverting several times. 

8.6.7  Route of Administration 

2 mg oral tablets and intravenous injection. 
Busulfan injection will be given by slow intravenous infusion over two (2) hours. 
Infusion  pumps  should  be  used  to  administer  the  diluted  busulfan  injection 
solutions.  Prior to and following each infusion, flush the catheter line with normal 
saline or D5W (approximately 5 ml). DO NOT infuse concomitantly with another 
intravenous solution of unknown compatibility. WARNING: RAPID INFUSION OF

-HT3 
AUCs  >  1500  microMolar
receptor antiemetics have all been used with busulfan injection. 
Phenytoin increases the clearance of busulfan by 15% or more, possibly due to 
the  induction  of  glutathione-S-transferase.  Since  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
busulfan injection were studied in patients treated with phenytoin, the clearance 
of  busulfan  injection  at  the  recommended  dose  may  be  lower  and  exposure 
(AUC)  higher  in  patients  not  treated  with  phenytoin.  Because  busulfan  is 
eliminated via conjugation with glutathione, use of acetaminophen prior to (<72 
hours)  or  concurrent  with  busulfan  injection  may  result  in  reduced  busulfan 
clearance  based  upon  the  known  property  of  acetaminophen  to  decrease 
glutathione levels in the blood and tissues

Two  case  reports  describe  fatal  cardiac  toxicity  in  patients  receiving

day 3.  Until additional data from clinical trials demonstrate the safety 
of  concurrent  use  of  these  drugs  concurrent  administration  is  not 
recommended. 
8.7.11.3  Succinylcholine 

Cyclophosphamide  may  prolong  the  effects  of  succinylcholine  by 
irreversibly  inhibiting  the  enzyme  pseudocholinesterase.    Limited 
clinical  observations  and  in  vitro    studies  suggest  that  prolonged 
apnea  might  result  when    succinlycholine  is  administered  to  some 
patients  also  receiving  cyclophosphamide.  Management  options 
include avoiding concurrent therapy or if concurrent therapy can not be 
avoided,  to  monitor  for  prolonged  succinlycholine  effect  in  patients 
receiving  both  drugs.  If  cyclophosphamide  has  been  administered 
within  10  days  of  succinylcholine,  extreme  caution  should  be  used 
after  succinylcholine  administration.    The  anesthesiologist  should  be 
informed  of  the  potential  for  succinylcholine-induced  apnea  and 
appropriate precautions and monitoring should be implemented.

BDesign Changes 
In  this  study,  all  eligible  patients  are  randomized  prior  to  induction  to  receive  either 
daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 combined with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 (Arm A) or daunorubicin 90 
mg/m2  combined  with  cytarabine  100  mg/m2  (Arm  B)  during  induction.  Patients  who 
achieve a CR are eligible for the post-remission therapy. The post-remission therapy in 
this  study  is  based  on  prognostic  factors.  Patients  with  unfavorable  prognostic  factors 
and/or HLA sibling match are allocated to an allogeneic transplant (Arm E). In the original 
design, patients with intermediate or favorable prognostic factors and/or no sibling match 
were randomized to receive either two cycles of high dose cytarabine and Gemtuzumab-
ozogamicin followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) (Arm 
D) or two cycles of high dose cytarabine followed by autologous PBSCT directly (Arm C). 
The original primary objective was to compare disease free survival (DFS) of two post-
remission autologous therapies. Based on an interim futility analysis conducted in Sept 
2007, 
the  step  2  post-remission 
randomization  be  stopped.  As  a  result,  on  October  4,  2007,  the  step  2  post-remission 
randomization between arms C and D was suspended. Since then, patients meeting the 
criteria  for  step  2  are  directly  assigned  to  Arms  C  or  E.  As  of  October  4,  2007,  270 
patients had been randomized to autologous PBSCT  arms (132 on arm C and 138 on 
arm D). 
Another  objective  in  this  trial  is  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  high-dose  daunorubicin  in 
induction  therapy.  Due  to  the  importance  of  this  induction  question,  the  study  will 
continue  to  the  planned  full  accrual  from  the  original  design.  The  following  statistical 
considerations  are  based  on  the  modified  design  schema  effective  since  October  4, 
2007.  
BEndpoints of the Induction Analysis 
The  major  endpoint  of  the  induction  question  of  this  randomized  phase  III  trial  is  to 
compare  overall  survival  (OS)  of  two  induction  regimens  (low-dose  versus  high-dose 
daunorubicin  and  cytarabine)  in  patients  with  de  novo  AML.  OS  is  defined  as  the  time 
between randomization and death from any cause. Patients last known to be alive at the 
time of an analysis will be censored. 
We plan to enter 830 patients on  induction over 6.9  years  with 2  years of follow up to 
compare the difference of OS between the two induction arms. The primary comparison 
will be an intention-to-treat analysis, including all randomized patients.

Because a moderate percentage of long-term cures have been observed with this patient 
population, we use a cure rate model for this OS endpoint. Assuming 25% cure rate and 
10 months median survival in non-cure group in low-dose daunorubicin and allowing for 
the interim analysis plan discussed below, the study will have 85% power to detect 23% 
reduction in hazard rate in high-dose daunorubicin arm, using one-sided log rank test at 
the significance level of 0.025 and assuming 2 years of follow-up. The number of events 
needed  is  563.  Interim  analyses  will  be  performed  on  induction  OS  endpoint  using 
truncated O'Brien-Fleming boundaries when 50% and 75% information time have been 
observed. If at one of the scheduled interim analyses, it has crossed the upper boundary, 
the  study  may  be  stopped  in  favor  of  the  alternative  by  the  ECOG-ACRIN  Data 
Monitoring Committee.

Estimates  of  overall  survival,  including  medians  and  confidence  intervals,  will  be 
calculated  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  Comparison  of  overall  survival  between 
treatments will be conducted using the one-sided log-rank test.  
Another endpoint of the induction analysis is to compare the complete remission rates of 
two induction regimens (Arm A and Arm B). With 830 patients, the study will have enough 
power to detect 10%-11% improvement in complete response (CR) rate with high-dose 
daunorubicin. Allowing for the interim analysis plan discussed below, Table 2 gives the 
power  of  comparing  the  CR  rates  of  two  induction  regimens  under  different  scenarios 
based on the planned sample size. For example, with 830 patients, the study will have 
approximately 90% power  to detect the improvement from 70% to 80%  with high-dose 
daunorubicin (arm B). If we assume 10% ineligible rate and only include eligible patients 
into the CR rate comparison, the study will have 85% power for comparing response rate 
of  70%  versus  80%.  The  power  calculations  of  CR  rate  comparison  were  based  on  a 
normal  approximation  with  continuity  correction  for  a  two  sample  binomial  test  at  
one-sided 0.025 significance level.

The induction CR rates will be monitored to allow for early stopping for futility through the 
use  of  the  repeated  confidence  interval  method  of  Jennison  and  Turnbull.  Should  the 
nominal 95% confidence interval for the difference in CR rate between Arm A and Arm B, 
using the O'Brien-Fleming critical value to determine the confidence interval width, fail to 
include  the  alternative  of  10%  improvement  with  Arm  B,  the  study  may  be  terminated 
early by the ECOG-ACRIN Data Monitoring Committee.

BEndpoints of the Consolidation Analysis 
The  major  endpoint  of  the  consolidation  analysis  is  to  compare  disease  free  survival 
(DFS) of two post-remission autologous therapies (Arm C and Arm D). DFS is defined as 
the  time  from  consolidation  randomization  until  relapse  or  death  of  any  cause.  The 
primary  comparison  of  DFS  will  be  performed  on  all  270  patients  randomized  prior  to 
October  4,  2007  and  secondarily  on  those  randomized  patients  who  actually  received 
autologous transplant. In addition, a DFS analysis restricted to those randomized patients 
who  complete  2  cycles  of  HDAC  will  also  be  considered.  Since  the  treatment  are  the 
same  to  that  point,  excluding  patients  who  do  not  complete  2  cycles  of  HDAC  should 
have less potential for bias than excluding patients who do not get transplant, and it could 
reduce  the  comparison  to  a  group  that  has  better  compliance  than  the  all  randomized 
analysis.  All those comparisons will be based on one-sided log-rank tests at the 0.025 
type I error. The final analysis of DFS comparisons will be conducted along with the final 
analysis of primary OS endpoint, which is anticipated at 2 years after the completion of 
the accrual. 
BEarly Monitoring for Toxicity  
The ECOG-ACRIN Data Monitoring Committee will receive safety data every six months 
throughout  this  study.  A  formal  presentation  and  discussion  took  place  to  review  the 
experience  of  the  first  100  patients  entered  on  the  trial.  While  there  was  not  enough 
power  to  perform formal  statistical  comparisons,  descriptive  data  was  presented  to  the 
Data  Monitoring  Committee,  for  assessment  of  safety  and  of  need  for  further  close 
toxicity  monitoring.  Specially,  the  incidence  of  VOD  on  the  Arm  B  -->  Mylotarg  of  the 
study was closely monitored. 
BMonitoring for Accrual and Compliance 
Rates of accrual and rates of compliance with all three components following the second 
randomization (consolidation, Mylotarg, and autologous transplantation) was included in 
the semi-annual reports to the Data Monitoring Committee before the suspension of step 
2  randomization.  The  reasons  that  patients  did  not  comply  with  their  assigned  therapy 
were examined. Rate of accrual of this study will be continually monitored throughout this 
study. 
BAccrual  
Based on the accrual to this study through December 2007, the projected accrual rate is 
about 120 patients per year. We will accrue 830 patients in 6.9 years.

BStatistical Considerations for the Laboratory Correlative Studies 
The  primary  intent  of  the  laboratory  correlative  studies  is  to  collect  pilot  data  for 
exploring/cross-examining  standard 
the 
statistical analysis will mainly be exploratory and descriptive. 
In the karyotype study, all samples will be analyzed by the standard cytogenetics, FISH, 
and multiplex RT-PCR at study entry to classify patients into cytogenetics group; and the 
results  from  standard  cytogenetics  will  be  compared  with  the  results  from  FISH  and 
multiplex  RT-PCR.  In  AML  trials,  about  40-50%  of  patients  present  with  a  normal 
karyotype  by  standard  cytogenetics.  Since  detecting  molecular  markers  resulting  from 
cryptic translocations is possible by FISH, we anticipate that about 20% of patients will be 
further  classified  into  cytogenetics  group  using  FISH.  To  determine  the  degree  of 
agreement  between  two  techniques  (i.e.  standard  cytogenetics  vs  FISH  and  standard 
cytogenetics  vs  multiplex  RT-PCR),  we  will  calculate  Kappa,  a  measure  of  agreement 
and  its 95% confidence interval. For example,  if the  observed proportion  of agreement 
between two methods is 70% and the expected proportion of agreement is 50%, then the 
kappa will be 0.25. 
In the study of minimal residual disease (MRD), MRD will be assessed at post-induction 
to  compare  the  impact  of  two  induction  therapies  on  MRD  and  at  prior  to  autologous 
PBSCT  to  compare  the  impact  of  Gemtuzumab-ozogamicin  on  MRD  between  the  two 
consolidation treatments. At each time, standard cytogenetics and FISH will be used to 
detect  MRD,  and  results  from  multiplex  RT-PCR  and  Flt3  gene  duplication  will  be 
collected  for  the  information  gathering  purpose,  not  for  the  analytic  purpose.  At 
postinduction, it is anticipated that about 30% of patients who have achieved CR in the 
standard dose daunorubicin arm (about 261 eligible patients) will show MRD. If the MRD 
rate among CRs in the high-dosedaunorubicin arm (about 298 eligible patients) is 19%, 
then  we  will  have  approximately  84%  power  to  detect  this  difference.  For  those  270 
patients  who  were  randomized  to  autologous  PBSCT  arms,  at  prior  to  autologous 
PBSCT, assuming 40% patients drop out the study,  it is anticipated that about  20% of 

55

Cancer Research Group 

E1900 
Revised 
Revised 4/08, Addendum #9 
patients in Arm C will show MRD. If the MRD rate is 20% in Arm C and 4.4% in Arm D, 
then  we  will  have  approximately  80%  power  to  detect  this  difference.  This  power 
calculation is based on Fish exact test at 0.05 two-sided level. 
Presence  of  Flt3  internal  tandem  duplication  (ITD)  will  be  evaluated  at  study  entry  by 
genomic PCR and sequence analysis of the Flt3 gene. Since the presence of Flt3 ITD 
has been known to be an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome in AML (41- 
48), the study will investigate if the presence of Flt3 ITD at diagnosis predicts OS or DFS. 
It  is  anticipated  that  about  25%  of  patients  will  be  Flt3  ITD  present  (Flt3  ITD+)  in  this 
patient population. 
Extrapolating  the  data  in  E3489,  if  the  long-term  cure  rate  is  23%  with  the  median 
survival for non-cured group about 10 months for patients with Flt3 ITD+ and 35% with 
the  median  survival  for  non-cured  group  about  11  months  for  patients  with  Flt3  ITD-, 
there will be approximately 84% power for detecting this survival difference. This power 
calculation is based on a one-sided log-rank test at 0.025 significance level using a cure 
rate model.  
When data are available, whether Flt3 ITD is an independent prognostic factor for OS or 
DFS or whether there is an interaction between the presence of Flt3 ITD and induction 
and/or post-remission therapy will be investigated using a multivariate analysis, such as a 
proportional hazards model. 
In  the  study  of  angiogenesis,  bone  marrow  angiogenesis  will  be  assessed  using 
immunohistochemical  staining  of  microvessels,  and  microvessels  will  be  quantified  by 
simple  grading:  low,  intermediate,  high.  We  will  collect  slides  several  times  during  the 
course of the study, however, only those slides collected prior to autologous PBSCT will 
be used to determine the impact of Gemtuzumab-ozogamicin on angiogenesis. Since this 
study is exploratory, the grading will further be simplified as high vs. low or intermediate. 
Assuming  40%  drop-out  rate  among  the  270  randomized  patients  to  the  autologous 
arms,  71 eligible patients in Arm C and 74 eligible patients in Arm D will stay on study 
prior  to  autologous  PBSCT.  Table  4  presents  power  for  detecting  various  levels  of 
proportion differences. This power calculation is based on Fisher's exact test at 0.05 two-
sided level of significance.

BStudy Monitoring 
BThis  study  will  be  monitored  by  the  ECOG-ACRIN  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC).  
The DMC meets twice each year.  For each meeting, all monitored studies are reviewed 
for safety and progress toward completion.  When appropriate, the DMC will also review 
interim analyses of outcome data.  Copies of the toxicity reports prepared for the DMC 
meetings are included in the study reports prepared for the ECOG-ACRIN group meeting 
(except that for double blind studies, the DMC may review unblinded toxicity data, while 
only pooled or blinded data will be made public).  These group meeting reports are made 
available to the local investigators, who may provide them to their IRBs.  Only the study 
statistician and the DMC members will have access to interim analyses of outcome data.  
Prior  to  completion  of  this  study,  any  use  of  outcome  data  will  require  approval  of  the 
DMC.  Any DMC recommendations for changes to this study will be circulated to the local 
investigators in the form of addenda to this protocol document. A complete copy of the 
ECOG-ACRIN DMC Policy can be obtained from the ECOG-ACRIN Operations Office -

BCytogenetics Review and FISH Studies 
11.1.1  Cytogenetics Review For Allogeneic Transplant 

11.1 

Those patients allocated by the investigator to allogeneic transplant at diagnosis 
with appropriate donor are required to submit karyotypes for cytogenetic review. 
Within 2-3 weeks of study entry, investigators will send results of karyotyping at 
study entry to the ECOG-ACRIN cytogenetics committee.  Karyotypes data will 
be analyzed to determine whether the patient will undergo allogeneic transplant 
or be assigned to one of the consolidation therapies. 
Those  patients  who  have  an  appropriate  donor  match  with  unfavorable 
cytogenetics  or  WBC  >  100,000/μl  will  undergo  allogeneic  transplant.    Donor 
matched  patients  who  do  not  have  unfavorable  cytogenetics  and  WBC  < 
100,000/μl  will  be  encouraged  to  be  assigned  to  one  of  the  consolidation 
therapies.  Patients  with  intermediate  risk  status  may  proceed  to  allogeneic 
transplant at the physician’s and patient’s discretion.  Patients with favorable or 
unknown  cytogenetic  risk  and  WBC  <  100,000/μl  who  wish  to  proceed  to 
allogeneic transplant must discontinue protocol therapy and receive treatment off 
study. 
The proposed definition of cytogenetic risk factor groups is the same as in Slovak 
et al. (20) and Appelbaum et.al. (67).

11.1.2  Standard Karyotype versus FISH Studies 

In  most  AML  trials,  40-50%  of  patients  present  with  a  normal  karyotype  by 
standard  cytogenetics.    However,  the  detection  of  molecular  markers  resulting 
from cryptic translocations is possible by FISH, multiplex PCR test, or Flt3 gene 
mutations.  These markers may be used to further subclassify these patients in 
terms of prognosis. 
This study will compare the results from standard karyotyping with FISH results.  
Commercial  probes  will  be  used 
favorable  chromosome 
abnormalities  and  the  most  common  unfavorable  chromosome  abnormalities.  
The panel FISH test will include probes to detect t(8;21) and inv(16) and variants.  
The  unfavorable  group  will 
-7/7q-,  and 
t(11;var)(q23;var).  The panel FISH test would also detect +8 and t(9;22). 
The FISH studies will use the following probes: ETO/AML1 for t(8;21), CBFβ for

11.1.6  Banking 

Original karyotypes will be returned when the review and analysis are complete. 
All  residual  cell  pellets  from  FISH  studies  will  be  stored  in  the  Mayo  Clinic

studies.  If future use is denied or withdrawn by the patient, the samples will be 
removed from consideration for use in any future study. 

BImmunophenotype and Molecular Genetics 
Immunophenotyping  has  become  an  essential  part  of  the  diagnostic  work-up  of  all 
leukemia  patients.    In  fact,  the  diagnosis  of  leukemia  without  immunophenotypic 
characterization  is  no  longer  acceptable.    ECOG-ACRIN  has,  therefore,  developed  a 
model  system  for  antigenic  data  collection  that  requests  specimens  from  all  patients 
entered  on  ECOG-ACRIN  leukemia  treatment  trials  be  studied  by  ECOG-ACRIN’s 
Leukemia  Translational  Studies  Laboratory.  In  addition  to  establishing  the  leukemia 
subtype, this centralized testing and data collection has allowed that research questions 
of clinical relevance to be applied to a growing database (e.g., definition of prognostically 
significant antigen expression levels to eventually yield specific treatment subcategories).  
Depending on the study protocol and tissue availability, anti-coagulated (heparin, EDTA, 
ACD) peripheral  blood  or bone marrow  or both are to be submitted  to  ECOG-ACRIN’s 
Leukemia Translational Studies Laboratory. 
In  addition  to  the  study  of  abnormal  hematopoietic  cells,  the  focus  of  research  on 
circulating serum factors in patients with leukemia or myelodysplasia has increased.  Two 
tubes  of  coagulated  peripheral  blood  (red  top  tubes)  are  requested  for  future  research 
studies  that  may  aim  at  identifiying  pathogenetic,  diagnostic,  or  prognositc  factors 
associated with leukemia or myelodysplasia. 
While there is a strong association between leukocytosis and presence of Flt3 ITD,  there 
is  no  association  with  FAB  subtype.  To  date,  correlations  between  Flt3  ITD  and 
immunophenotypic  features  of  the  leukemic  cells  are  not  available.    Given  its  high 
frequency in AML, it is one of our goals to discover an immunophenotypic surrogate

BMicrovessel Density (MVD) and Angiogenesis 
BThe  extent  of  bone  marrow  angiogenesis 
standard 
immunohistochemical  stains,  such  as  von  Willebrand  Factor  (vWF;  Factor  VIII  related 
antigen)  or  CD  34,  to  identify  bone  marrow  microvessels.(59-61).    In  our  laboratory, 
immunohistochemical staining of microvessels is performed using a labeled streptavidin-
biotin  peroxidase  method,  as  previously  described,  on  a  Ventana  ES  automated 
immunohistochemistry  stainer  (Ventana  Medical  Systems,  Tucson,  AZ,  USA)  using 
buffers  and  detection  reagents  supplied  by  the  manufacturers  (62).    For  vWF  staining, 
deparaffinized tissue sections are subjected to protease digestion on the instrument with 
Protease 2 for 12 minutes prior to immunostaining.  The primary antibody (DAKO A0082, 
Dako,  Carpinteria,  CA,  USA,  diluted  1:2000)  is  incubated  with  tissue  sections  for  24 
minutes.  For CD34 staining, deparraffinized tissues are pretreated using EDTA (pH 8.0) 
in a steamer for 30 minutes followed by a cool down for 5 minutes.  The primary antibody 
(monoclonal CD 34, Beckton-Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA, diluted 1:10) is incubated 
with the tissue sections for 32 minutes.  For both stains, the AEC (aminoethyl carbazole) 
detection  kit  (Ventana  Medical  Systems)  is  used  for  antigen  visualization;  sections  are 
counterstained with a light hematoxylin and then coverslipped with Kaiseri’s glycerol jelly 
(Mayo  Medical  Laboratories,  Rochester,  MN,  USA).    Paraffin  sections  of  well-
vascularized tonsil are run with each batch to serve as a positive control, and a section 
stained  with  non-immune rabbit immunoglobulin is used as a  negative control for each 
sample tested. 
BThe  commonly  used  quantitative  methods  to  evaluate  microvessels  identified  by 
immunohistochemical stains are: simple grading (low, intermediate, high), determination

Bof microvessel  density  (MVD),  and  estimation  of  the  percentage  of  tissue  surface  area 
that  is  occupied  by  microvessels  (MSA)  (59,60).    All  estimations  should  be  done  in  a 
blinded manner.  Methods used in our laboratory are detailed below, and are similar to 
standard methods used by other investigators (62-64). 
BFor simple grading, slides are scanned at 100x, 200x and 400x magnification, and based 
on the extent of microvessel staining, each slide is assigned an angiogenesis grade: low, 
intermediate or high.  This grading was based solely on visual assessment of the number 
of  microvessels.    The  entire  stained  sample  was  considered  when  assigning  the 
angiogenesis grade.   
BFor MVD estimation each slide is first scanned at 100x magnification to determine 3 “hot 
spots” defined as areas with the maximum number of microvessels.  The “hot spots” are 
then  examined  at  400x  magnification,  using  a  10x  ocular  and  40x  objective  lens.  
Microvessels  are  counted  in  each  of  the  three  hot  spots  at  400x  magnification.    Large 
vessels and vessels in the periosteum or bone are excluded.  Areas of staining with no 
discrete  breaks  are  counted  as  a  single  vessel.    Presence  of  a  lumen  is  not  required.  
MVD is estimated by determining the average the number of vessels in each of the three 
hot spots and expressing the result as number of vessels per 400x high power field.   
BComputerized image analysis is used for estimation  of MSA. “hot spots” are evaluated 
under 200x magnification and captured using a digital camera. Optimas 6.0 software for 
Windows 95 (Optimas Corp., Seattle, WA, USA) is used for analysis of digitally captured 
images.  Using computerized pixel counting, MSA is determined and expressed as the % 
of the captured region of interest that is occupied by immunohistochemical staining (65).  
An optimized MSA value can be determined by eliminating the area occupied by fat and 
expressing the result as a % of cellular area occupied by staining (57,59).   
BAssays will be done by Dr. Rajkumar's laboratory.

BAppendix I 

Suggested Patient Consent Form 

You are being asked to take part in this study because you have acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) and blood disorder that has recently been diagnosed. 
 
This  is  a  clinical  trial  (a  type  of  research  study).  Clinical  trials  include  only  patients  who 
choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision and discuss it with your 
friends and family. 

BWHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 

This  study  is  being  done  to  determine  which  treatment  is  best  for  patients  with  newly 
diagnosed  AML.  The  study  consists  of  two  parts.  The  first  part  will  look  at  two  different 
starting (induction) therapies. One arm consists of treatment with a standard dose of FDA 
approved drugs for AML. The second arm of the study will double the dose of one of the 
drugs (daunorubicin) during the initial therapy. 
 
For all patients whose disease disappears (are in a complete remission) further therapy will 
be given as is customary for this disease. The second part of the study will use high-doses 
of  chemotherapy  with  a  blood  stem  cell  transplant,  with  your  own  blood,  or  in  certain 
instances, the blood of your sibling, to treat the leukemia. 

 

 

BHOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY? 

About 830 people will take part in this study.

BWHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY? 

Please see the study plan on the last page of this form. 
NOTE:  Pre-study bone marrow samples will be sent to central reviewers to confirm if you 

have acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 

This study has two parts. 
In the first part of the study you will receive one of two induction treatments. The treatment 
you receive  will be decided by chance. You and your doctor will NOT be able to choose 
which treatment you receive. One group of patients will get standard chemotherapy using 
the  FDA  approved  drugs  daunorubicin  and  cytarabine  (the  “7+3”  treatment).  The  second 
group of patients will receive a doubling of the daunorubicin dose with the same dose of 
cytarabine. After chemotherapy, in both groups, you will receive a FDA approved drug (GM-
CSF)  to  help  your  blood  recover  from  the  effects  of  chemotherapy.  You  may  receive  a 
maximum  of  two  of  these  treatments  to  reach  a  complete  remission  state  (complete 
disappearance of the disease in your blood and bone marrow). 
If you are in a complete remission you will receive more therapy. In the second part of the 
study you will get the therapy according to your risk of having the disease return. 
NOTE:  Your  risk  will  be  determined  by  evaluating  your  white  blood  count  and  your 
karyotype (genes of the blood cells).  Your white blood count will be done by the 
facility where you are receiving treatment.  The karyotype analysis will be done 
by a central laboratory.   

If you are at high risk for the disease returning, and you have a brother or sister who is a 
HLA tissue match then you will be offered an allogeneic (from brother or sister) transplant. 
You will proceed directly to this treatment. 
If you chose not to have the allogeneic transplant, or do not have a brother or sister who is 
a match, or are not considered to be high-risk for relapse (return of the disease), then you 
will complete the therapy as described below.   
Patients  will  receive  two  cycles  of treatment  with  high  doses  of  cytarabine  approximately 
one month apart. After chemotherapy you will receive an FDA approved drug called GM-
CSF to help your blood recover from the effects of chemotherapy. After recovering from the 
second treatment you will be given more G-CSF to promote the movement of the stem cells 
(seed cells of the bone marrow) into the blood. You will then proceed to a collection of the 
stem cells, which will be used for your transplant.  
For  the  autologous  transplant  you  will  receive  standard  chemotherapy  using  the  FDA 
approved drugs Intravenous Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide. After chemotherapy you will 
receive previously collected stem cells as a transplant. The transplant will be followed by 
the FDA approved drug GM-CSF to help your transplanted stem cells recover. 
If you take part in this study, you  will have the following tests and procedures.  Some of 
these tests would be done even if you did not participate in this study.

Tests 

E1900 
Revised 
Revised 4/08, Addendum #9 

•  Physical exams 
•  Blood tests 
•  Bone marrow biopsy with aspirate 
•  Heart function tests 
•  Lung function tests 
•  Pregnancy test before start of study 
•  HIV test before transplant 
•  Central Review:  While you are on the study, samples of your tissue, blood, bone 
marrow, and karyotypes (genetic characteristics of a cell) will be sent to a central 
laboratory to be examined by a central review.  These reviews are to confirm the 
results of the local laboratory review and to establish your treatment assignment. 

 
Procedures  

 

Before  and  after  the  study  treatment  you  will  have  several  bone  marrow  biopsies  and 
aspirates.  These tests will probably be part of your treatment even if you decide not to take 
part in this study. 

Bone  marrow  biopsy  involves  removing  a  small  piece  of  bone  from  your  breastbone, 
collarbone, or the back of your hip.  This is done using a special tool which removes a very 
small piece of bone.  Bone marrow is then removed.  A bone marrow aspirate will be done 
at the same time.  During the aspirate some blood is removed from the middle of your bone.  
The bone marrow and aspirate collected in the treatment part of the study will be used to 
check  your  health.    Bone  marrow  biopsy  and  aspirate  is  usually  done  under  local 
anesthesia  by  a  doctor.    There  is  a  risk  of  bleeding,  bruising  at  the  biopsy  site,  and 
infection.  Your doctor will discuss this procedure with you in detail and you will be asked to 
sign a separate consent. 

Before beginning any study treatment you will have a central venous catheter inserted by a 
surgeon  or  interventional  radiologist.    This  device  is  similar  to  an  IV  but  it  is  placed  in  a 
larger vein, usually under the collarbone or in the lower neck.  Unlike an IV, central venous 
catheter can stay in place for weeks or months without being replaced.  Your chemotherapy 
treatments will be given through the central venous catheter.   
A surgeon will insert the central venous catheter as an outpatient procedure.  The risks of 
this procedure include bleeding and infection.  There is also the possibility of lung puncture 
and irregular heart beats.  These side effects are uncommon but can sometimes be fatal.  
The risks of this procedure will be explained to you in detail by the surgeon and you will be 
asked to sign a separate consent.

Part I:  In the first part of this study you will receive daunorubicin standard-dose (Group A) 
versus high-dose (Group B)) once a day over fifteen minutes through an IV for three 
days. You also will receive Cytarabine through an IV 24 hours a day for 7 days. You 
will receive a drug called GM-CSF to help your body make more blood cells 
Twelve  to  fourteen  days  after  you  complete  treatment  with  daunorubicin  and 
Cytarabine,  you  will  begin  to  receive  GM-CSF  once  a  day  as  an  injection 
underneath your skin or through your IV.  GM-CSF will help your body make more 
blood cells.  You will continue to receive GM-CSF until your blood recovers. 

Part II: In the second part of this study you will receive an allogeneic transplant, if you have 
high-risk  for  relapse  of  the  disease  and  have  a  brother  or  sister  who  is  a  tissue 
match.  If you undergo this approach you will not receive consolidation therapy but 
rather go immediately to transplant.  
If  you  do  not  meet  those  requirements  or  do  not  desire  the  transplant  from  your 
brother or sister, then you will begin treatment to undergo an autologous transplant 
(your own cells will be collected and then put back after your therapy). Before your 
cells are collected, you will receive two cycles of a higher dose Cytarabine. You will 
receive Cytarabine through an IV every 12 hours on the first, third and fifth day of 
treatment.  The treatment cycles will be given approximately one month apart. 

 
 
Collection of Stem Cells 
After recovery from the second Cytarabine treatment you will receive G-CSF to promote the 
collection of the stem cells. 
A  type  of  blood  cell  called  a  stem  cell  will  be  collected  using  a  process  known  as 
leukopheresis.  Leukopheresis is a process where blood is removed from the body through 
a catheter to a special machine. There the blood is separated and the white blood cells are 
removed. In this white blood cell collection are the stem cells, which will be frozen away for 
your  transplant.  The  leukopheresis  uses  FDA  approved  standard  and  commercially 
available instruments to collect the stem cells. 
Collecting your stem cells will take about 4-6 hours, during which you will be lying in bed.  
The procedure usually requires 1-6 sessions (usually 2-3) to get enough stem cells for later 
transplant. 
After  the  stem  cell  collection,  you  will  be  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  two  groups.    You 
have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

During this part of this study you will also receive high-dose chemotherapy with Busulfan 
and Cyclophosphamide.  You will then receive your stem cells and receive GM-CSF to help 
your transplanted stem cells grow and recover. 
To  prevent  potential  seizures,  which  may  or  may  not  occur,  you  receive  phenytoin  or 
clonezapan. 
Busulfan will be given through your central venous catheter for 2 hours 4 times a day for 4 
days/total of 16 doses. 
After finishing the 4 days of Busulfan, you will then receive Cyclophosphamide by vein for 4 
hours each day for the next 2 days. 
Two  days  after  finishing  the  cyclophosphamide,  your  previously  frozen  stem  cells  will  be 
thawed and returned to you by vein. 
After the stem cell transplant you will receive GM-CSF once a day either through an IV or 
by injection.  You will continue to receive GM-CSF until your blood and transplanted stem 
cells recover. 
 

BHOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY? 

We think you will be receiving study treatment for several months. 
After finishing the study treatment you will have a blood test and bone marrow biopsy with 
aspirate every 3 months for 2 years after transplant, then as needed. 
We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life to look at the 
long-term effects of the study. 
Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if: 

Your disease comes back. 
The study treatment causes severe, unmanageable or life threatening side effects. 
New information becomes available 
Or 
It is not in your best interest to continue. 

You may stop participating at any time.  However, if you decide to stop participating in the 
study, we encourage you to talk to your doctor first.

BWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY? 

E1900 
Revised 
Revised 4/08, Addendum #9 

Bleeding 
Bruising at the biopsy site 
Infection 

Part I (dose intensification,) is considered experimental.  While on the study, you are at risk 
for  certain  side  effects.    The  Cytarabine,  Daunorubicin,  GM-CSF,  G-CSF,  Busulfan,  and 
Cyclophosphamide used in the study may cause all, some, or none of the side effects listed.  
You should discuss these with your regular doctor.   There also may be other side effects that 
we  cannot  predict.    Other  drugs  may  be  prescribed  to  make  side  effects  less  serious  and 
uncomfortable.    Many  side  effects  go  away  shortly  after  the  treatment  is  stopped,  but  in 
some cases side effects can be serious, long lasting, permanent, or life-threatening 
Your physician will check you closely to see if any of these side effects are occurring, and 
routine blood tests will be done to monitor the effects of the treatment. 
 
The risks and side effects of bone marrow biopsy and aspiration may include: 
• 
• 
• 
 
The risks and side effects of central venous catheter insertion may include: 
• 
• 
Rare 
• 
• 
 
Part I: 
 
Risks and side effects related to the Daunorubicin and Cytarabine may include: 
More Likely 
• 

Low  red  and  white  blood  cells,  and  low  platelets  (blood  cells  that  allow  clotting).  
Blood samples will be taken frequently to watch for these side effects.  The GM-CSF 
used  in  this  study  should  prevent  this  side  effect  from  becoming  severe  and  helps 
your blood counts return to normal.  This side effect is usually temporary. 
Low white blood cell counts can lead to an increased risk of infection.

Risks of Autologous Stem Cell Transplant 
Use  of  your  own  stem  cells  has  special  risks  that  differ  from  those  of  standard  chemotherapy.  
High-dose  chemotherapy  with  Busulfan  and  Cyclophosphamide  will  destroy  your  bone  marrow.  
This will increase the chance of bleeding or serious infection. There is less than rare (<1%) chance 
of the bone marrow not recovering after the transplant. 
 
You may have low red and white blood cells, and low platelets (blood cells that allow clotting) until 
the transplanted stem cells begin to make new blood cells.  Blood samples will be taken frequently 
to watch for these side effects.  The GM-CSF used in this study should prevent this side effect from 
becoming  severe  and  helps  your  blood  counts  return  to  normal  levels.    These  side  effects  are 
usually temporary. 

•  Low white blood cell counts can lead to an increased risk of infection. 
•  Low red blood cells may cause you to feel weak, tired, cold, or short of breath. 
•  Low  platelet  counts  may  cause  you  to  bruise  easily,  develop  spots  on  your  skin 

resembling pinpricks or a rash, or bleed longer if you are hurt. 

•  Both bleeding and infection after stem cell transplant can be severe and fatal. 
•  There is a chance that the transplanted stem cells may not recover.  This would be fatal. 
• 
•  Recurrent leukemia. 
•  Permanent  damage  to  other  organs,  such  as  your  lungs,  liver,  heart  or  kidneys,  which 

Infection with bacteria, fungi, or different viruses. 

could prove fatal or disabling 

Risks of Allogeneic Transplant 
If you receive a transplant from another donor (allogeneic transplant) there are both risks from the 
chemotherapy  (see  Risks  and  side  effects  of  Busulfan  and  Cyclophosphamide,  page  8)  and the 
transplanted cells. The chemotherapy risks are explained in the section for autologous transplant. 
Transplanted stem cells obtained from a donor (allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant) 
may react against your body causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  Sometimes despite these 
interventions, the disease persists causing chronic illness, organ damage and/or death. 
The risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) varies depending upon the age of the patient and 
donor.    Acute  GVHD  is  when  the  donor’s  cells,  growing  in  the  recipient  (patient),  attack  the 
recipient’s liver, stomach, intestinal lining and skin.  Patients, who are older than 20 years old, may 
have a 30-55% risk of acute GVHD, which can cause a severe rash, diarrhea and abnormal liver 
function.  In its extreme case, GVHD can be life threatening.  There is also a 50-75% risk of chronic 
GVHD,  which  can  cause  scarring  changes  in  the  mouth  and  intestines,  vagina,  dry  eye/mouth 
syndrome, abnormal liver function, and scarring and stretching rash of the skin. It may also lead to 
lung  inflammation.    Chronic  GVHD  may  be  associated  with  a  higher  chance  of  chronic 
complications and risk of death.  
Treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD can cause high blood pressure, headaches and other 
neurological problems, kidney problems, softened bones, puffing of the face and increase in body

and death from these organisms.

Revised 4/08, Addendum #9 

This study includes laboratory tests that will analyze small samples of your bone marrow 
and  blood.    The  bone  marrow  samples  will  be  collected  during  your  routine  biopsies 
performed  during  your  therapy.    No  extra  biopsies  will  be  performed.  The  blood  will  be 
collected using a needle to draw some blood out of a vein.  
The  bone  marrow  and  blood  will  be  sent  to  central  laboratories  where  tests  will  be 
performed.  Researchers will be performing these tests in order to understand the effects of 
the therapy on your type of cancer.  They also hope this will help them better understand 
your type of cancer.  The results from these tests will not be sent to you or your doctor, and 
will not be used in planning your care.  These tests are only for research purposes.  These 
tests are done at no cost to you.  You and your insurance will NOT be charged for these 
tests

BWILL ANY OF THE SAMPLES (E.G., TISSUE) TAKEN FROM ME BE USED FOR 
OTHER RESEARCH STUDIES? 

About Using Tissue for Research 
If you participate in the laboratory study associated with this protocol, you are going to have 
some  blood  and  bone  marrow  collected    which  will  be  sent  to  a  central  laboratory  for 
analysis.  We would like to keep some of the blood and bone marrow that is left over for 
future research.  If you agree, this blood and bone marrow will be kept and may be used in 
research to learn more about cancer and other diseases.  This blood and bone marrow will 
only be given to researchers approved by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group.  Any 
research done on the tissue must also be approved by the researcher's Institutional Review 
Board.   
Your blood and bone marrow may be helpful for research whether you do or do not have 
cancer.  The research that may be done with your blood and bone marrow will probably not 
help you.  It might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future. 
Reports about research done with your blood and bone marrow will not be given to you or 
your doctor.  These reports will not be put in your health record.  The research will not have 
an effect on your care. 
Things to Think About 
The choice to let us keep the left over blood and bone marrow for future research is up to 
you.  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care and you may still take part 
in the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group study. 
If  you  decide  now  that  your  blood  and  bone  marrow  can  be  kept  for  research,  you  can 
change your mind at any time.  Just contact your study doctor and let him or her know that 
you do not want us to use your blood and bone marrow.  Then the blood and bone marrow 
will no longer be used for research. 
In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health.  When 
the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group gives them reports about your health, it will not 
give them your name. 
Sometimes blood and bone marrow is used for genetic research (about diseases that are 
passed  on  in  families).    Even  if  your  blood  and  bone  marrow  is  used  for  this  kind  of 
research, the results will not be put in your health records. 
Your blood and bone marrow will be used only for research and will not be sold.  You will 
not be paid for allowing your leftover blood and bone marrow to be used in research even 
though  the  research  done  with  your  blood  and  bone  marrow  may  help  to  develop  new 
products in the future.  Similarly there will be no cost to you for any blood and bone marrow 
collected and stored by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. 
It is possible that at some time in the future, that as part of deciding on what therapy to give 
you,  a  new  test  might  be  available  that  could  be  done  on  some  of  the  blood  and  bone 
marrow that is now thought of as leftover.  This situation is unusual, but it could happen.  In 
order to see that not all this leftover blood and bone marrow is used up, the ECOG-ACRIN 
Cancer  Research  Group  will  take  care  to  see  that  some  of  your  cancer  blood  and  bone

marrow  is  stored  for  10  years  so  that  it  is  available  should  it  be  needed  by  you  or  your 
doctors.  This  will  depend  upon  the  amount  of  leftover  blood  and  bone  marrow  that  is 
submitted for this study, however, there may not be any left over blood and bone marrow to 
store. 
Benefits 
The benefits of research using blood and bone marrow include learning more about what 
causes cancer and other diseases, how to prevent them, how to treat them, and how to cure 
them. 
Risks 
There are very few risks to you.  The greatest risk is the release of information from your 
health  records.    The  ECOG-ACRIN  Cancer  Research  Group  will  protect  your  records  so 
that  your  name  will  be  kept  private.    The  chance  that  this  information  will  be  given  to 
someone else is very small. 
Making Your Choice 
Please  read  each  sentence  below  and  think  about  your  choice.    After  reading  each 
sentence, circle "Yes" or "No."  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  
You can participate in the treatment part of the study without participating in all or part of 
the  blood  and  bone  marrow  research  studies.    If  you  have  any  questions,  please  talk  to

Part I 

On day 1 

You will begin to receive cytarabine continuously through your catheter. You will receive cytarabine 24 hours 

a day for seven days. 

On days 1,2,3 

You will receive daunorubicin through your catheter either in standard or high-dose once each day for 10 to 

15 minutes.. 
On day 12-14 

You will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate 

 On day 12-14 

On day 12-14 the GM-CSF will be given IV daily until there is an adequate recovery of blood counts (to ANC 

of >1000).  The recovery is expected to take 25-30 days from the initiation of chemotherapy. 

If you have M4 or M5 AML and/or you have symptoms that suggest involvement of the disease around the 

brain, you will be treated with chemotherapy (methotrexate) that will be injected into the spinal column. 

During Induction  

Part II 

If the disease has not recurred you can participate in part II. If you are at a high risk for relapse of the 

disease and you have a brother or sister who is a tissue match you will be referred for a stem cell transplant 

from your sibling (allogeneic transplant). 

If the above conditions are not met or you do not want an allogeneic transplant: 

Days 1, 3, 5 

You will receive high dose cytarabine over 3 hours every 12 hours by IV in your catheter. 

Day 8 

You will receive GM-CSF daily by IV in your catheter or by an injection underneath your skin. You will 

continue to take GM-CSF until your blood recovers (about 30 days). 

Within one to three months 

You will repeat the above high-dose cytarabine of Part II. 

After recovery of the second high dose cytarabine you will take G-CSF by IV in your catheter or by an 

injection underneath your skin for 5 days. On the sixth day we will collect your stem cells through a special 

catheter. These cells will be stored for your transplant. 

After collection of the stem cells: 
You will proceed to transplant  
Autologous Transplant 

Day –8 you will start taking phenytoin or clonazepam by mouth daily for the next 6 days. 

Days –7 to –4 

You will receive busulfan IV in your catheter over two hours every six hours each day for four days. 

You will receive cyclophosphamide IV in your catheter over two hours daily each day for two days.

REGULATORY AND MONITORING 
Study Audit 
To assure compliance with Federal regulatory requirements [CFR 21 parts 50, 54, 56, 312, 314 
and  HHS  45  CFR  46]  and  National  Cancer  Institute (NCI)/  Cancer Therapy  Evaluation  Program 
(CTEP)  Clinical  Trials  Monitoring  Branch  (CTMB) guidelines for  the  conduct  of  clinical  trials  and 
study data validity, all protocols approved by NCI/CTEP that have patient enrollment through the 
CTSU are subject to audit. 
Responsibility for assignment of the audit will be determined by the site’s primary affiliation with a 
Cooperative  Group  or  CTSU.  For  Group-aligned  sites,  the  audit  of  a  patient  registered  through 
CTSU  will  become  the  responsibility  of  the Group  receiving  credit for the  enrollment.  For  CTSU 
Independent Clinical Research Sites (CICRS), the CTSU will coordinate the entire audit process. 
For patients enrolled through the CTSU, you may request the accrual be credited to any Group for 
which  you  have  an  affiliation  provided  that  Group  has  an  active  clinical  trials  program  for  the 
primary disease type being addressed by the protocol. (e.g., NSABP members may only request 
credit for protocols pertaining to breast or colorectal cancers).  Registrations to protocols for other 
disease sites may still take place through CTSU without receiving credit for your NSABP activities.  
Per capita reimbursement will be issued directly from CTSU. 
Details  on  audit  evaluation  components,  site  selection,  patient  case  selection,  materials  to  be 
reviewed,  site  preparation,  on-site  procedures  for  review  and  assessment,  and  results  reporting
