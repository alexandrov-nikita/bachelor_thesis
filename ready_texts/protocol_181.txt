Introduction   
Background   

Women with clinical stage T1 or T2 N0 M0 breast cancer will undergo sentinel lymph node dissection 
(SLND) with breast conserving therapy (BCT). Women who are found to have a sentinel node (SN) 
containing metastatic breast cancer as documented on frozen section, touch prep, or permanent section 
evaluation by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining will be randomized to receive either completion 
axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or no immediate additional axillary surgery or axillary-specific 
radiation. Subsequently, women in both Arms will then have whole breast radiation therapy and, if 
indicated, systemic adjuvant therapy.   

1.1.1   

Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND)   

Although axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been used in the management of breast cancer for at 
least a century, its role is controversial.    The status of the axilla is an important prognostic indicator and has 
been the mainstay for accurate staging of patients with breast cancer. The NIH Consensus Conference in 
1990 recommended that Level I and II ALNDs be routine for staging and regional control for patients with 
early breast cancer [NIHCC 1991]. Since ALND is associated with significant morbidity, some have tried to 
develop less invasive procedures to identify axillary metastases. However, at present, no existing imaging 
modalities or biologic markers can successfully identify patients with axillary metastasis with sufficient 
sensitivity to be used clinically.   

1.1.2   

Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection   

Morton et al. popularized SN lymphatic mapping for patients with malignant melanoma [Morton 1992]. A SN 
is the first lymph node that drains a particular cancer into the lymphatic system and thus, histopathologic 
examination may determine the status of the lymphatic basin. Giuliano et al. applied this dye technique to 
patients with early stage breast cancer [Giuliano 1994].    In the most recent series of patients, the SN was 
successfully identified in 93% of the patients and it was 100% predictive of nodal status [Giuliano 1997]. 
Others have had similar success with the identification of SNs in breast cancer using a variety of agents such 
as isosulfan blue dye, radioactive colloid or a combination of both [Krag 1993, Veronesi 1997, Albertini 
1996]. SLND is able to accurately stage breast cancer tumo rs by identifying those with axillary metastasis, 
and may offer an alternative to ALND.   

1.1.3 

The Need for Axillary Lymph Node Dissection   

Axillary metastasis traditionally has dictated the need for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal 
therapy. Over the past few years, more attention has been focused on the characteristics of the primary tumor. 
The need for chemotherapy is often based solely on the size of the primary tumor and its biologic 
characteristics. Therefore, at present, many women receive adjuvant chemotherapy despite a negative axilla.   
This brings into question the continued need for an immediate axillary dissection.   

The ALND has a role in staging, regional control, and perhaps survival. The presence or absence of lymph 
node metastases in the ALND determines stage, not necessarily the number of positive nodes [Beahrs 1992]. 
ALND offers excellent regional control. Axillary recurrences after ALND for clinically node-negative 
women are extremely unusual and are in the order of 12% [Ivens 1992]. The impact of ALND on survival is 
perhaps the most controversial aspect. Originally, it was assumed, because of the Halstedian concept of the 
biology of breast cancer, that en-bloc resection of the regional nodes improved survival by complete removal 
of local and regional tumor. Since then, numerous studies and observations have invalidated the Halstedian 
concept itself as well as the impact of axillary surgery on survival. However, the data are conflicting and 
numerous well recognized studies have raised unanswered questions related to whether ALND itself affects 
survival.   

A number of studies epitomized by the prospective randomized trial of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast 
and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-04 Trial, have shown no impact of ALND on survival [Fisher 1985].    In the 
NSABP B-04 trial conducted in the early 1970’s, patients were randomized to radical mastectomy, total 
mastectomy, or total mastectomy plus post-operative radiation therapy to the chest wall and regional lymph 
nodes. In the radical mastectomy group, 38% of patients were found to have tumor-involved lymph nodes.   
Since this was a randomized trial, it could be assumed that 38% of patients in the other two arms had 
tumor-involved lymph nodes. However, the regional recurrence rate after total mastectomy alone, with no 
regional axillary therapy, was only 18 percent and the regional recurrence rate after axillary radiation therapy

without axillary surgery was only 2 percent. In addition, there was no statistically significant effect of 
loco-regional control on survival.    Patients who developed an axillary recurrence after total mastectomy alone 
were treated with a delayed ALND. All three arms had similar survival rates, with follow-up as long as 15 
years.    This study forms the most solid basis for those who believe ALND offers no beneficial effect on 
survival. Table 1 lists other studies supporting the concept that loco-regional control through ALND or 
radiation therapy does not affect survival.

The contrary viewpoint supports the importance of ALND, suggesting that inadequate loco-regional control 
adversely affects survival.    One of the best known of these studies is the Second Guys Hospital Trial 
[Hayward 1981]. This trial was randomized, comparing women treated with radical mastectomy and regional 
lymphatic radiation to those treated with local excision of the primary breast tumor and radiation therapy to the 
breast and regional lymphatics. The radiation therapy used in this trial was only 3,000 centigray to the regional 
lymphatics. This is now recognized to be an inadequate dose. The patients treated with radical mastectomy had 
a 2.0% axillary recurrence, whereas those treated with no axillary surgery and inadequate radiation therapy had 
an 11% axillary recurrence rate. These two groups had statistically significant differences in local control, 
regional control, and in overall survival.    The increased axillary recurrence in the group receiving no ALND 
was associated with a significant diminution of overall survival by about 10% compared to those women 
treated with radical mastectomy. This effect has persisted for at least 20 years, suggesting that effective breast 
and axillary treatments may be associated with an enhancement in overall survival. Table 2 lists other studies 
supporting the concept that loco-regional control through ALND or radiation therapy does affect survival.

Treatment and Survival Following Axillary Recurrence   

While the adverse effect of loco-regional recurrence after total mastectomy (TM) for breast cancer has been 
recognized, the impact of loco-regional failure after breast-conserving surgery and radiation is less clear. Of 
the patients with loco-regional failure after BCT, only 5% to 15% present with concurrent distant metastases 
[Fowble 1990, Haffty 1991, Recht 1989, Fourquet 1989, Stotter 1989]. In contrast, up to 25% of patients who 
present with loco-regional failure after TM have concurrent distant metastases or develop distant metastases 
within a few months of the loco-regional failure [Andry 1989, Marshall 1974, Aberizk 1986].    In the Danish 
trial by Overgaard et al., 41% (31 / 75) of loco-regional failures in the RT + CMF arm failure, as well as 20% 
(56 of 277) in the CMF alone arm, presented with concurrent distant metastases [Overgaard 1997]. In addition, 
outcomes after aggressive salvage of loco-regional failure also are different between TM and BCT patients. In 
a series of patients at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (JCRT) with loco-regional failure after TM, the 5 
and 10-year actuarial rates of freedom from distant metastases were 30% and 7%, respectively. In contrast, 
patients with salvage TM after BCT and loco-regional failure at JCRT had a better prognosis [Abner 1993].   
The 5-year actuarial rate of further recurrence in this group was 37%, and the 5-year cause-specific survival 
was 79%. Similar results for BCT loco-regional failure salvage have been reported from the University of 
Pennsylvania [Orel 1993]. Thus, the prognostic significance of loco-regional failure may not be the same 
between patients receiving TM and BCT.   

1.1.5   

SLND Only Versus ALND   

A major problem with the majority of studies examining the impact of axillary node dissection on survival is 
inadequate sample size and/or follow-up.    Studies of surgical therapy alone demonstrate that 50% of patients 
with nodal metastasis survive 20 years. Since only about 35% of clinically node-negative breast cancers have 
axillary node metastasis, at best we could expect only about 17.5% of the patients to have a chance to be 
affected by interventions studied (50% of the 35% patients who are node-positive).    The majority of studies 
had insufficient statistical power to detect a difference in survival related to ALND.   

Some reasons that SLND may replace ALND relate to the biology, epidemiology, and screening of breast 
cancer. Due to increased public awareness and improved screening, there has been a decrease in the mean 
maximum diameter of breast cancer tumors and a concomitant decrease in the number of women with lymph 
node metastasis [Tabar 1992]. Cady et al. reported that the mean maximum diameter of breast cancers upon 
diagnosis declined by 10% every 5 years and from about 3 cm to about 2 cm from 1968 to 1988 [Cady 1997]. 
In the five years from 1989 through 1993, the median maximum diameter of all invasive breast cancers was 
only 1.5 cm at diagnosis. This decrease in size has been seen in numerous other reports.    These same 
authorities report a diminution in the number of patients who have axillary lymph node metastasis.   

At the New England Deaconess Hospital, only 31% of all patients with invasive breast cancer were found to 
have involved lymph nodes at diagnosis.    In addition, over 40% in that series had only one lymph node 
involved and almost 50% had only micrometastases. While Cady has used this diminution in the incidence of 
lymph node metastasis to support the concept that no ALND is necessary for the management of women with 
mammographically detected T1a or T1b breast cancer [Cady 1994], these findings can be used equally well to 
support the fact that in a large percentage of women, removal of the SN alone may result in not only accurate 
staging, but in effective regional control. Giuliano's studies have shown that in approximately 70% of the 
cases, the SN is the only involved node in patients with early breast cancer. Albertini et al. has seen similar 
results; noting that the SN was the only involved node in at least 50% of cases [Albertini 1996]. It is quite 
possible that after accurate staging with SLND, no residual tumor is left in the remainder of the non-sentinel 
axillary lymph nodes, and regional control will be accomplished. However, it also may be that some women 
with SN metastases will have micro-or macrometastases in non-SN that will progress and develop into 
regional recurrences that may or may not be associated with a diminution of overall survival. In addition, it is 
possible that metastases in non-SN would be destroyed or inhibited by the adjuvant systemic therapy that is 
given to most women with involved lymph nodes. In addition, some metastases may be ablated by opposing 
tangential fields of radiation therapy.   

In addition, it is quite possible that lymph node metastases are indeed "indicators but not governors" of distant 
metastases [Cady 1984]. This concept can be supported by the observations that variations in loco-regional 
management including the elimination of ALND (as in B04) have not generally been associated with 
alterations in overall survival (with some exceptions). Additional experimental works by Nicholson and Dulski 
[Nicholson 1986] and Brodt et al. [Brodt 1990, Brodt 1991] have shown the site-specific metastatic potential 
of malignant cells. Axillary lymph node metastases may be site specific. Should metastases develop in the 

Z0011 A9

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

axilla, delayed dissection may be as effective as immediate dissection on overall survival for these patients.   

Although some studies do suggest an improvement in overall survival based on local control, it is not clear 
that axillary control is the ultimate link for these successes. The recent RT studies are the most compelling 
survival evidence, but they do not address breast conservation and include only premenopausal women 
[Ragaz 1997, Overgaard 1997].    This study will include both pre- and postmenopausal women with stage I 
and II disease.   

1.1.6   

The Design of Z0011   

SLND offers the unique opportunity to examine the impact of ALND on regional control and survival in 
early stage disease. By performing a SLND, patients with regional metastasis can be identified. It is these 
patients, if any, who are likely to benefit from ALND. If there is a benefit to be achieved from ALND, it will 
not be in node-negative women.    These women can therefore be spared the morbidity of ALND. The lower 
morbidity of SLND is obvious; however, to formally document this, patients will be evaluated by range of 
motion exams and arm measurements. All operative complications will be recorded.   

If there were no outcome difference between these two arms, then the treatment with the least morbidity, 
presumably SLND, would be preferable. By randomly assigning SN positive women to axillary therapy 
consisting of at least a level I and II A LND or to no further axillary therapy, the impact of axillary lymphatic 
clearance on survival can be assessed. It may be that after removing a positive SN, no further surgery is 
necessary for the woman with regional lymph node metastases from early breast cancer.    If axillary surgery is 
merely a staging (diagnostic) procedure, then no adverse effects should be seen when it is omitted and replaced 
by SLND.   

1.2 

Objectives   

The primary objectives are:   

Long term: To assess whether overall survival for patients randomized to Arm 2 (no immediate ALND) 
is essentially equivalent to (or better than) than that for patients assigned to Arm 1 (completion ALND).   

Short term: To quantify and compare the surgical morbidities associated with SLND plus ALND versus SLND 
alone.   

1.3   

Study Design   

1.3.1   

Accrual Goal   

This study requires the randomization of 1900 evaluable patients over a period of 3.8 years based on a 
projected accrual rate of 500 eligible patients randomized per year. The randomization between the arms 
will be 1:1. The final analysis is projected for 8.8 years following the start of accrual.

Patient eligibility must be determined by the investigator.   

2.1   

Inclusion Criteria   

A patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if ALL of the following criteria apply:   

PLEASE  NOTE:  Patients  registered  to  this  study  may  undergo  intra-operative  or  postoperative 
randomization.   

An investigator registering patients to this study after completion of SLND (post-operative

study if they have a cytologic diagnosis suggestive of carcinoma from a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a 
palpable or non-palpable breast lesion and the investigator believes the breast lesion is clinically 
suspicious for invasive breast carcinoma.   

5.  Date of the patient’s first tissue diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma or cytologic diagnosis of 

carcinoma must be no more than 60 days prior to the SLND.   

6.  The patient who had BCT (segmental mastectomy) performed previously, and is now referred to the local 
investigator for SLND, is eligible if the BCT was less than or equal to 60 days prior to the SLND. NOTE: 
Copies of the operative and pathology reports must be submitted as part of the registration process.   

7.  Patient must have ECOG/Zubrod status =2, as documented in patient’s medical record.

are met:   

a.  The patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies,   

b.  There has been no evidence of any prior malignancies for at least five years with no evidence 

of recurrence (except for effectively treated basal cell or squamous carcinoma of the skin, 
carcinoma in -situ of the cervix that has been effectively treated by surgery alone, or lobular 
carcinoma in-situ of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast treated by surgery alone), and   

c.  The patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk for recurrence from prior 

malignancies.

Staging Criteria   

th 

For this study, patients will be staged according to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 5
1997 (See Appendix for Staging Reference). NOTE: In the 5
 edition, specific criteria for micrometastatic 
lymph node deposits are not defined. Although the 6th edition of the AJCC Cancer staging manual defines 
micrometastases as tumor deposits greater than 0.2mm but not greater than 2.0mm in largest dimension, this 
definition is not used to determine eligibility for Z0011. Therefore, for this study, a SLN with a 
micrometastatic tumor deposit < 0.2mm will also be considered a positive SLN.

4    Registration/Randomization   

There are two options for registering and randomizing a patient to Z0011.   

1.  Post-Operative Registration with Randomization must be followed when the patient is eligible for this 

study following completion of SLND and confirmation of metastatic breast cancer in a sentinel node by 
H&E staining on permanent section.   

2.  Pre-Registration with Intra-Operative Randomization can be used for sites electing to randomize 

intra-operatively based on frozen section or touch prep assessment of sentinel node status.   

 
4.1   

ACOSOG Companion Study Z0010   

This section applies to clinical sites that have both ACOSOG Study Z0010 and Study Z0011 open. ACOSOG 
Study Z0010 is designed to assess the prognostic significance of occult metastases detected by IHC in sentinel 
lymph nodes that are negative by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in women with early-stage breast 
cancer.    It also is designed to assess the prognostic significance of occult metastases detected in the bone 
marrow by immunocytochemistry (ICC) in this patient group.     

The accrual goal for ACOSOG Study Z0010 was met and the study was permanently closed to accrual on 
5/30/2003. All patients currently on the study must continue to be followed according to protocol 
specifications. Annual IRB review and approval of the protocol and consent form must continue until all 
registered patients have completed the follow-up phase of the study.   

4.2   

Randomization Arms   

Women with clinical stage T1 or T2 N0 M0 breast cancer who are found to have a SN containing metastatic 
breast cancer through SLND with BCT, as documented on frozen section, touch prep, or permanent section 
evaluation by H&E staining, will be randomized to one of two Arms:   

Arm 1: Completion ALND, followed by whole breast radiation therapy and, if indicated, systemic 
adjuvant therapy   

OR   

Arm 2: No immediate additional axillary surgery or axillary-specific radiation, followed by whole 
breast radiation therapy and, if indicated, systemic adjuvant therapy.   

4.2.1   

Assessment of Stratification Factors   

The following factors are believed to be prognostic for survival and will be used in the 
randomization as dynamically balancing stratification factors:   

  Age: 50 or > 50.   

  Estrogen Receptor (ER) status: positive or negative.   

  Tumor size:  1 cm, > 1 cm or  2cm, or >2 cm.   

 
4.3   

Registration/Randomization Procedures   

Registration is available 24 hours a day by accessing the ACOSOG web site at http://www.acosog.org. 
ACOSOG staff is accessible at the ACOSOG Coordinating Center on Monday through Friday, from 8:00 
AM to 5:00 PM Eastern time.    For detailed registration guidelines, refer to the Patient Registration SOP on 
the ACOSOG web site.   

4.3.1   

Registration Worksheet   

The Registration Worksheet of the CRF (RW CRF) must be completed as documented in the patient’s 
medical record PRIOR to initiating the registration procedure for either preregistration with intra-operative 
randomization or for post-operative registration/randomization.    A completed worksheet must be 
submitted within 24 hours of the registration.   

To be eligible for registration to this study, the patient must meet each inclusion and exclusion criterion listed 
on the eligibility checklist. There is no mechanism for making exceptions to the eligibility requirements.

Pre-Registration with Intra-operative Randomization   

Pre-registration is available 24 hours a day by accessing the ACOSOG web site at http://www.acosog.org. 
ACOSOG staff is accessible at the ACOSOG Coordinating Center on Monday through Friday, from 8:00 AM 
to 5:00 PM Eastern time.    For detailed registration guidelines, see the Standard Operating Procedure Patient 
Registration (PatReg SOP) on the ACOSOG web site.   

Pre-registration is necessary in advance of intra-operative randomization.    The ACOSOG registration program 
performs a pre -registration and issues “tokens” for completion of the registration and randomization 
intra-operatively.   

The pre-registration and intra-operative registration and randomization procedures are as follows:   

1.  Documented informed consent must be obtained prior to the pre-registration process.   

2.  RW CRF must be completed prior to patient pre-registration.    No exemptions or waivers will be granted 

for patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria.   

3.  The pre-registration process consists of accessing the ACOSOG website (http://www.acosog.org) and (a) 

confirmation of the validity of investigator membership, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, 
skills, etc., (b) assignment and recording of the ACOSOG Patient Identification Number, and (c) 
assignment and recording of the token (a randomly generated 8-digit number linked to the patient 
information submitted).   

4.  Confirmation of pre-registration is e-mailed from the ACOSOG Coordinating Center to the clinical site 

immediately following the pre-registration.   

5.  During surgery, use a touch-tone telephone to access the automated Interactive Voice Response (IVR) 

system for randomization by calling 866 488 0651 or 919 668 7126. The person placing the 
randomization call responds to pre-recorded voice requests using the touch-tone pad.    The caller will be 
prompted to provide the token given during the preregistration process. Once the token is verified, the 
randomized treatment Arm is given.   

6.  Submission of the completed RW CRF is required within 24 hours following completion of patient 

registration. The RW CRF must be faxed to 919 668 8466, the DataFax system at the ACOSOG 
Coordinating Center.   

If a patient’s SN is found to be negative by frozen section, the site has the option of canceling the token at this 
point. The site also may opt to defer token cancellation until after final pathology has confirmed a negative SN 
by H&E, since H&E may come back with a positive SN result. In this case, the uncancelled token may then be 
used by the site to obtain randomization.   

If a patient is found to be ineligible during surgery for any other reason, cancel the token using the Cancel 
Token procedure on the Patient Registration page of the ACOSOG web site.   

In the event of electronic or communication problems, see the Standard Operating Procedure Patient 
Registration (PatReg SOP) on the ACOSOG web site for emergency procedures. All sites should have a 
printed copy of this SOP available for reference.

North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) Registration Instructions   

A signed HHS 310 form must be on file at the NCCTG Randomization Center before patient entry.   

NCCTG institutions must fax (507-284-0885) a completed ACOSOG Registration Worksheet 8 a.m. to 3:30 
p.m. central standard time Monday through Friday to register a patient. Patient eligibility and existence of a 
signed consent form will be checked by the NCCTG Randomization Center before a patient will be registered 
into this study.   

Upon confirmation of eligibility, the NCCTG Randomization Center will access ACOSOG’s web-based 
registration system to register the patient. Eligibility information given in the Registration Worksheet will 
determine the type of registration that will be conducted by the NCCTG Randomization Center. ACOSOG 
Coordinating Center will e-mail the NCCTG Randomization Center (jacobson.susan2@mayo.edu, 
mahon.carol@mayo.edu, parkin.diane@mayo.edu) a confirmation of registration that will include the 
following:   

  ACOSOG Patient ID Number   

 

 

 

Patient randomization (if web-based registration and randomization was conducted), OR   

8-digit token number (if web-based pre-registration was conducted) Note: randomization will NOT be 
given at this point.   

This information will be forwarded to the registering institution by the NCCTG Randomization Center.   

To obtain patient randomization if pre-registration was performed, refer to Section 4.3.2 (Pre-Registration 
with Intra-operative Randomization) and follow the steps starting from #5. If the patient is found ineligible 
for the study after pre-registration (i.e. patient did not have positive sentinel node), the institution will 
cancel the token (see Section 4.3.2).

Interventions   
This section gives an overview of the intervention(s) and procedures to be used in this study and how they are 
to be applied. Specific interventions and procedures are identified in bold italics.    The details of the 
interventions and procedures associated with this protocol are described in the Details of Intervention and 
Procedures section of this protocol.   

5.1 

Intervention Scheme   

A patient will be eligible for this trial only if metastatic tumor is detected in the SN by routine 
histopathology, either on frozen section, touch prep, or permanent sections.   

The patient will be randomized to one of two Arms, Arm 1 or Arm 2, where the interventions associated 
with these Arms are as follows:   

Arm 1: Level I and II Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) followed by adjuvant   
breast radiation therapy and, if indicated, adjuvant systemic therapy.   

Arm 2: Breast radiation therapy and, if indicated, adjuvant systemic therapy only (no   
immediate further axillary-specific interventions).   

There are two procedural options for implementing the ALND in patients randomized to Arm 1 depending 
on the option used to register the patient:   

1.  Post-Operative Registration with Randomization. Obtain the informed consent and randomize the 

patient postoperatively only if the SN demonstrates metastatic disease and the patient is otherwise 
eligible. If the patient is randomized to Arm 1, then the ALND is performed as a second operation.    If the 
patient is randomized to Arm 2, then a second operation should not be performed.   

2.  Pre-Registration with Intra-Operative Randomization.    Use frozen section or touch prep assessment 
of the SN to ascertain eligibility during surgery and randomize intraoperatively if the node is positive. If 
the patient is randomized to Arm 1, proceed immediately with an ALND. If the patient is randomized to 
Arm 2, then an ALND should not be performed.   

All patients, regardless of when they are randomized and which arm they are assigned to, should be treated 
with whole breast radiation therapy and, if indicated, adjuvant systemic therapy.   

The ALND (to be done as a result of being randomized to Arm 1), breast radiation therapy, and adjuvant 
systemic therapy should be performed as defined.   
 
Details of Intervention and Procedures   

Segmental Mastectomy (Lumpectomy)   
All patients will undergo resection of the segment of breast tissue, which contains the primary breast tumor 
with a clear margin of removed normal tissue around the periphery of the tumor.    In addition, the underlying 
pectoral fascia, but not the pectoralis major muscle, together with a segment of overlying skin, may be 
removed if deemed necessary. The specimens will be oriented for histopathologic examination.    The 
specimens may be inked by the surgeon. Margins must be assessed and deemed tumor free by the institutional 
pathologist. Copies of the institution's operative and pathology reports must be submitted to the ACOSOG 
Coordinating Center.   

 

5.2   

5.2.1   

5.2.2   

Lymphoscintigraphy/ Intraoperative Gamma Counting   

For patients with medial hemisphere lesions, defined as a tumor that is completely medial to the border of the 
areola, either a lymphoscintigram or report of intraoperative gamma counting is required. A copy of the nuclear 
radiologist’s report must be submitted in cases with a lymphoscintigram, and a copy of the operative gamma 
counting must be submitted with the operative report.   

5.2.3   

Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection (SLND)   

SLND may be performed with isosulfan blue dye, a radiopharmaceutical, or a combination of both.   
Regardless of the technique utilized, a lymphoscintigram or intra-operative gamma counting must be 
performed on all patients with medial hemisphere breast tumors to ensure that the primary drainage   
pathway is to the ipsilateral axilla.    For the purpose of this protocol, a medial hemisphere lesion is defined as 
one in which the entire tumor is medial to the most medial margin of the areola. Patients who do not have 

Z0011 A9 

 

17 

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

drainage to the ipsilateral axilla will be excluded from the study.    When a lymphoscintigram is obtained, a 
copy of the nuclear medicine physician's lymphoscintigram report must be submitted. Since only one of 
several different methods will be used for identifying the SN, each investigator should determine the 
technique, which represents the best practice at his/her institution.   

Although this study does not dictate which technique should be used, guidelines are provided here for the 
various techniques. Regardless of the technique used, no more than four gross SNs should be removed in each 
patient. If a surgeon is removing more than four nodes on a repeated basis, the surgeon will be subject to a 
performance audit. At times, the pathologist may identify more lymph nodes than the surgeon did. Therefore, 
the final number of SNs may exceed four, and this will not reflect on surgeon performance.   

Blue Dye Technique   

The following method may be utilized for this procedure:   

After the induction of general anesthesia or local anesthesia with heavy intravenous sedation and prepping and 
draping of the patient, 4-5 cc of 1% isosulfan blue dye is injected into the breast parenchyma surrounding the 
primary tumor, or into the wall of the cavity created by the previous biopsy. If the lesion is not palpable, a 
mammographic or ultrasonographic localization will be required. A needle may be left in the breast 
parenchyma through which the blue dye can be instilled in the operating room. The breast is gently compressed 
to augment the action of the lymphatic pump and promote passage of blue dye to the axilla.    The timing of the 
axillary incision after the injection of the blue dye and the volume of dye injected are extremely important and 
dependent upon the location of the primary tumor. Suggestions for volume of injectate and timing are given 
below.   

After the allotted time, a transverse incision is made just inferior to the hair-bearing region of the axilla. Blunt 
dissection is then carefully performed with the tips of a curved hemostat to identify a blue-stained lymphatic 
channel located just below the superficial axillary fascia.    It is helpful to raise the arm above the patient’s 
head (135 abduction) to facilitate the identification of the blue lymphatic channel. Do not raise skin flaps. 
The blue lymphatic channel is followed proximally and distally until the first blue node or SN is identified. 
The SN may be sent to pathology for frozen section. Depending on the histology of the SN, the patient will be 
treated accordingly.

Radiolabeled Sulfur Colloid Technique (Hot Technique)   

Prior to the operation, 0.25mC to 1.0 mC of radiolabeled technetium sulfur colloid will be injected into the 
breast parenchyma surrounding the primary tumor or into the wall of the cavity created by the previous 
biopsy. If the lesion is non-palpable, a mammographic or ultrasonographic localization will be required. A 
needle may be left in the breast parenchyma through which the radioactive colloid may be instilled.    Care 
should be made not to contaminate the skin with the radiopharmaceutical. After the induction of general 

Z0011 A9 

 

18 

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

anesthesia or heavy intravenous sedation, a gamma counter will be used to localize the SN. For patients with 
inner hemisphere lesions, the surgeon must identify axillary drainage. Each gamma counter should be 
calibrated according to the manufacture’s recommendations. For example:   

C Trak, Carewise Medical, Palo Alto, California: initial settings should be a window of 30KeV and a 
threshold of 130KeV. To optimize weak signals the window may be increased to 40KeV and the threshold 
decreased to 120KeV.   

Neoprobe, Dublin, Ohio: initial settings should be a threshold of 120KeV and a window of 40KeV. 
Some adjustments may be made using the squelching options.   

Navigator, USSC, Norwalk, Conn: Initial settings should be a threshold of 90-100KeV.    Pitch and count 
time may be adjusted.   

A sterile plastic sheath should be used to cover the probe. The lymphatic drainage pattern is mapped in 
the operating room and a transverse incision is made over the axillary “hot spot.”   

Dissection is then carefully performed until the signal intensifies and an axillary lymph node is found. Once 
the SN is identified and removed, the axillary basin should be measured for any residual radioactivity. If the 
basin remains “hot”, an attempt should be made to find a second SN. If the SN is not identified secondary to 
the “shine through” from the primary injection site then the segmental mastectomy may be performed prior to 
the sentinel lymph node biopsy.    The SN may be sent to pathology for frozen section if allowed by the 
institution's radiation safety officer. If a frozen section or touch prep is not permitted then the treatment must 
be based on the permanent section diagnosis. 

Combined Blue and Hot Technique   
Prior to the operation, 0.25 mC to 1.0 mC of a radiolabeled technetium sulfur colloid will be injected into the 
breast parenchyma surrounding the primary tumor or into the wall of the cavity created by the previous biopsy. 
If the lesion is non palpable, a mammographic or ultrasonographic localization will be required. A needle may 
be left in the breast parenchyma through which the radioactive colloid and the blue dye may be instilled. After 
the induction of general anesthesia or heavy intravenous sedation, prepping and draping the patient, 4-5 cc of 
isosulfan blue dye will be injected as previously described. The breast is then gently compressed to augment 
the action of the lymphatic pump and promote passage of blue dye to the axilla.    During the delay from 
injection to axillary incision the gamma probe (either C Trak, Neoprobe or Navigator) may be used to 
map the lymphatic drainage pattern.   

After 3-7 minutes, a transverse incision is made just inferior to the hair-bearing region of the axilla. Blunt 
dissection is then performed to identify a blue stained lymphatic channel. The blue lymphatic channel is then 
followed proximally and distally until the first or SN is identified. This can be confirmed with the gamma 
counter.    If the SN is not identified with the blue dye and the “shine through” from the primary site interferes 
with the ability to identify the “hot spot,” the lumpectomy may be performed prior to identifying the SN. 
However, removal of the tumor prior to injection of the blue dye is discouraged. Once the SN has been 
removed, the axillary basin should be measured for any residual radioactivity. If the basin remains “hot” then 
an attempt should be made to find a second SN. The SN may be sent to pathology for frozen section or touch 
prep may be done if allowed by the individual institution's radiation safety officer. If a frozen section or touch 
prep is not permitted then the treatment must be based on the permanent section diagnosis.   

5.2.4   

Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) for Arm 1   

Patients will undergo removal of at least level I and II axillary lymph nodes. If necessary, the pectoralis 
minor muscle may be incised but not removed. At least ten lymph nodes should be identified in the axillary 
specimen.    If ten lymph nodes are not identified, then the patient will still be included in the study. 
Surgeons who consistently remove less than 10 axillary lymph nodes will be re-evaluated for continued 
inclusion in this study.    Copies of the operative and pathology reports must be forwarded to the ACOSOG 
Coordinating Center.   

5.2.5   

Adjuvant Radiation Therapy (Arm 1 & 2)   

All patients will undergo adjuvant radiation therapy. The breast radiation therapy to be done on this protocol 
specifically excludes adding a third (supraclavicular) field because that would confound the issue being 
addressed by the study. In addition, the breast radiation therapy given is subject to review. A sample of 
patients will be selected and the clinical sites will be required to submit the portal films for those patients to a 
central review. The portal films, prescriptions, and supporting physics documentation for randomly selected 

Z0011 A9 

 

19 

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

patients will be requested and therefore the clinical site is advised to prepare to the extent possible for such 
requests.   

Dose: Dose to the prescription point for the breast is 45 Gy to 50 Gy, in equal daily fraction sizes of 1.8 to 2.0 
Gy per day, 5 days per week. For whole breast doses below 50 Gy, a boost dose must be prescribed to bring 
the primary surgical tumor bed to a minimum total dose of 50 Gy. Higher doses to the boost volume may be 
given at the discretion of the radiation oncologist.   

Dose Specifications:    The dose will be prescribed to the entire breast volume or clinical target volume (CTV). 
The CTV will be defined with the patient in the supine treatment position by palpating the periphery of the 
breast tissue and marking it with radio-opaque markers, such as lead wire. In a patient with surgical clips 
placed in the tumor bed, the clips must be within the CTV. The planning target volume (PTV) is the clinical 
target volume plus a margin of 1.0 to 2.0 cm superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally. Tangent fields with 
a coplanar posterior border are used. The prescription point used is the lung-chest wall interface in the central 
axis plane.    This prescription method ensures that the entire PTV receives a minimum dose equal to the 
prescription dose. The dose to this point, as well as the maximum dose to the PTV or the central axis plane 
should be reported. Inhomogeneity corrections are not allowed.   

Technical Factors   

  Equipment must have nominal photon energies between 4 MV and 8 MV.   

  Compensators, wedges, or dynamic therapy must be used to keep the maximum PTV dose within 

15% of the prescription.   

  The beam may be shaped, with a margin, to the shape of the breast with cerrobendtype blocking or 

by using a multi-leaf collimator.   

 

Fields will be designed using a simulator unit or CT simulator with appropriate patient immo 
bilization for daily accuracy.    Use of an Alpha-cradle would be one example. A mammorex board 
is another.   

 

Critical Structure Dose   

The maximum distance from the posterior or deep field border to the lung/chest wall interface will be 3.0 
cm, anywhere in the field.   

Treatment Interruptions   

If a treatment interruption is necessary for acute radiation toxicity of the skin, aggressive treatment of the 
area with a product like Duoderm is encouraged to minimize the treatment break. The total time to 
deliver the radiation therapy should not exceed 8 weeks.   

Supraclavicular Field   

The use of a third field to cover the supraclavicular area is not allowed.   

Side Effects   

Fatigue is the anticipated systemic reaction to radiation. Skin erythema and desquamation also may occur.   
Breast edema, tenderness, and myositis also are acute side effects. Possible long-term complications include 
radiation pneumonitis, rib fractures, and cardiac complications for left-sided lesions.   

5.2.6   

Adjuvant Systemic Therapy (Arm 1 & 2)   

The use of systemic adjuvant therapy is advised for the node-positive women.    The type of systemic therapy 
offered is at the discretion of the treating physician and the patient. The type of therapies discussed in the 
Background section of this protocol or enrollment onto another clinical trial is encouraged. When selecting 
another clinical trial as the means of administering systemic adjuvant therapy then special care should be used 
to avoid trials for which the collection of data needed for this trial would be compromised; in general, this 
should not be a major problem.   

5.3   

Study Withdrawal   

Patients will be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:   

1. 

If a patient was registered to the study based on cytologic diagnosis suggestive of carcinoma from FNA 
of a palpable or non-palpable breast lesion, but the final tissue diagnosis does not demonstrate invasive 
breast carcinoma, the patient will be discontinued from the study and will not be followed.   

Z0011 A9

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

2.  A patient with tumors located in the medial hemisphere of the breast that show a complete absence of 

drainage to the axilla by lymphoscintigram or by absence of elevated axillary lymph node gamma 
counts will be discontinued from the study and will not be followed.   

3. 

If the final pathology report identifies three or more positive sentinel nodes, the patient will be 
discontinued from the study and will not be followed.

Follow-up 

6.1   

Subsequent Care   

All patients should be instructed to communicate with the investigator or study surgeon prior to consenting to 
additional therapy (not included in this protocol).   

6.2   

Disease-Related Assessments 

Patients will be monitored for local and regional recurrence (especially recurrence in the ipsilateral axillary 
bed), contralateral breast primary tumors, distant recurrence, progression, and death. Patients also will be 
monitored for additional non-breast primaries, which should be confirmed histologically whenever possible.   

6.2.1   

Suggested Assessments in Response to Symptoms   

The following assessments are recommended for the purposes of disease evaluation in the presence of 
symptoms:   

 

 

 

If patient has new symptoms of bone or back pain, a bone scan and relevant x-rays should be done.   

If patient has symptoms of abdominal pain, or the physician notes jaundice, hepatomegaly, or an elevation 
in the liver function tests, then a CT scan or MRI of the abdomen should be obtained.   

If patient exhibits a change in mental or neurologic status, then a CT scan or MRI of the brain should be 
obtained.   

6.3   

Assessment of Axillary Bed and Arm Effects   

Special assessments for surgical side effects in the axillary bed and arms will be as required by the Study 
Calendar.    These assessments will be done on all patients, regardless of whether an ALND was done. The 
Follow-up Breast and Arm Assessment case report form (FBAA CRF) will be used.    This form is specially 
designed for the following assessments:   

  Axillary pain or numbness.   

  Range of motion limitations noted on abduction.   

 

Ipsilateral edema of the arm as demonstrated by an increase that is > 10% in circumference of the affected 
arm from the pre-operative measurement. Symptoms of lymphedema also should be noted.   

 
7    Evaluation of Outcomes   

The primary endpoint is overall survival. Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of initial 
diagnosis until the date of death. Patients will be followed for overall survival for a maximum of 10 years 
from the date of surgery. Secondary endpoints of interest are:   

1.  Distant disease-free survival.    Distant disease is defined as the distant recurrence of breast cancer. Breast 

cancer in the contralateral breast or ipsilateral axilla is not a distant recurrence.   

2.  Comparison of surgical morbidities associated with SLND plus ALND versus SLND alone.

8    Adverse Event Reporting   
8.1   

Definition of Adverse Event   

An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or 
procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).   

8.2   

Definition of Serious Adverse Event   

A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:   

  Results in death or   

 

Is life-threatening (at the time of the event) or   

  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization or   

  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or   

 

Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in an offspring).   

 

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether the designation of an event as 
serious, is appropriate in other situations, such as medical events that may not be immediately life 
threatening but may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.   

8.3   

NCI Common Toxicity Criteria   

This study will collect AEs using the current version of the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), if 
applicable. An electronic version of the CTC may be accessed through the web at http://ctep.cancer.gov/. 
The CTC provides a descriptive terminology that is to be used for AE reporting. A grading (severity) scale 
is also provided in the CTC for each AE term.   

8.4   

Expected Adverse Events   

8.4.1   

Short-Term Effects   

Short-Term Effects are specific surgically-related events expected during this study that are to be followed 
using the Short-Term Surgical Effects case report form (SSE-CRF).    The SSE-CRF will be used to report the 
status of the patient’s AEs during the 30-day period following the last study-related operation.   

The following surgery-related events must be reported if the event(s) occur:   

  Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (to dye or radionucleotide that requires administration of histamine 

antagonists or systemic support)   

  Wound infection (breast or axillary wound infection that results in the opening of the wound or 

administration of antibiotics non-prophylactically)   

  Wound non-infection (axillary seroma that requires the opening of the wound or placement of a drain)   

  Wound non-infection (axillary hematoma that requires surgical evacuation)   

  Neuropathy-sensory (axillary paresthesia and/or intercostobrachial nerve paresthesia)   

  Operative injury (brachial plexus injury)   

 
8.4.2   

Long-Term Effects   

Long-Term Effects are specific surgically-related events expected during this study that are to be followed 
using the Long-Term Surgical Effects case report form (LSE-CRF).    The LSE-CRF will be used to report the 
status of the patient’s AEs assessed as required by the Study Calendar.   

The following surgery-related events must be reported if the event(s) occurs, continues, or progresses:   

  Lymphatics (lymphedema -- arm circumference 2 cm greater or more than baseline measurement)

  Neuropathy-sensory (axillary paresthesia)   

  Operative injury (brachial plexus injury)   

 
8.4.3   

Reporting of Expected Adverse Events   

AEs that are expected and listed as short term or long-term effects will be reported using the appropriate 
CRFs, SSE-CRF or LSE-CRF.   

Expected AEs related to radiation therapy or adjuvant systemic therapy are not listed as part of this protocol. 
Any AEs noted as expected by other sources that are Grade 1,2, 3 or 4 should not be reported.   

Expedited reporting is required for any expected AE that is reported as fatal (Grade 5) within 30 days 
following the study intervention regardless of attribution.   

All reported AEs should be followed until final resolution.   

8.5   

Unexpected Adverse Events   

An Unexpected Adverse Event is any event that is not listed as a short-term or long-term effect in the 
Expected Adverse Events section of this protocol.   

8.5.1   

Reporting of Unexpected Adverse Events   

All unexpected AEs related to surgical interventions will be reported using the AE-CRF.    The severity of 
the event should be graded using the CTC criteria, if applicable or if the grade categories are listed under 
“Grade of Adverse Event” in the section below. Attribution also should be determined and reported on the 
CRF. Categories of attribution are defined under “Attribution of Adverse Event” in the section below.”   

Exception: Unexpected AEs related to radiation therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy that are Grade 1, 2, or 
3 should not be reported.   

Expedited reporting is required for any unexpected AE that is reported as life threatening (Grade 4) or fatal 
(Grade 5) that occurs within 30 days following the study intervention regardless of attribution.   

All reported AEs should be followed until final resolution.   

8.5.2   

Attribution of Adverse Event   

Attribution must be determined by the investigator or study surgeon, documented and reported. The following 
categories should be used when determining whether an AE is related to the medical treatment or surgical 
procedure:   

Definite   

Clearly related to medical treatment or surgical procedure   

Probable   

Likely related to medical treatment or surgical procedure   

Possible   

May be related to medical treatment or surgical procedure   

Unlikely   

Doubtfully related to medical treatment or surgical procedure   

Clearly NOT related to medical treatment or surgical procedure   

Unrelated   
 
Grade of Adverse Event   

8.5.3

to obtain full-size blank CRFs for data submission to the ACOSOG Statistics and Data Center. 

Case Report Form Completion and Submission Guidelines   

Effective November 14, 2011, all participating sites will submit patient data via fax to 
507-293-3575 for entry by Statistics and Data Center personnel.   

10    Statistical Considerations   

This trial is designed to test the null hypothesis that survival for patients assigned to Arm 2 (no ALND) is 
significantly worse than for patients assigned to Arm 1 (ALND). Rejection of this null hypothesis would 
provide evidence in favor of clinical adaptation of SLND without ALND (Arm 2). A short-term primary 
objective is to quantify the morbidities associated with ALND and SLND.   

The ACOSOG Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will control access to and release of results from this 
study and closely monitor the study. The DMC will meet every six months and will be given a progress report 
at those meetings. Some of the progress reports will include scheduled formal analyses (see below).   

The trial is planned with the intent of reporting results from short-term objectives following the completion of 
accrual to this randomized trial and prior to the time when results associated with the long-term objective 
(survival comparison) can be reported.    The DMC will be asked for permission to report results associated 
with short-term objectives, with the overriding consideration being whether the release of these results could 
in any way compromise meeting the long-term objective.   

The trial size is based on the requirements of the Z0011 primary long-term objective (testing the null 
hypothesis).   

The following are trial size computations and use a type I error probability  = 0.05 (one-tailed), and a type II 
error probability  = 0.1 (power=90%). These computations are done using a modification of the algorithm 
described by Rubinstein, Gail, and Santnor [Rubinstein 1981]. The primary analysis will be done using 
proportional hazard regression.   

Let A designate the hazard rate in Arm 1, and B designate the hazard rate in Arm 2.    The hypotheses are: 

H0: B/A  against Ha: B/A < ,   

Where  specifies the hazard ratio criterion that indicates that the survival outcome in Arm 2 is worse than 
for Arm 1, H0 is the null hypothesis and Ha is the alternative hypothesis. The specific criterion for inferiority 
of Arm 2 used in the computations is  = 1.3, with equivalence in the hazard ratio ( = 1) as the specific 
alternative hypothesis. Rejection of the null hypothesis provides evidence that not doing an ALND in women 
found to have a positive SN results in survival that is not substantially worse than performing an ALND.   

An estimate of survival in near optimally treated node-positive women is 70% at 8 years [Fisher 1989]. 
Another estimate of survival for node-positive women is 76% at 5 years [EBCTCG 1992]. These estimates 
and exponential survival distribution assumptions are used to compute hazard rates used in subsequent trial 
size computations. The computed hazard rates for these two survival estimates are 0.0446 and 0.0549, 
respectively. The former hazard rate estimate is the more conservative and is favored.   

Trial size computations are displayed for an accrual rate of 500 eligible patients per year. This accrual rate 
was estimated from a survey. Alternative follow-up intervals following the completion of accrual of 3 and 5 

Z0011 A9 

 

25 

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

years also are specified.   

The computed accrual times for specified hazard rates, accrual rates, and follow-up times are shown in the 
following table. The hazard rates for Arm 1 are those computed from survival estimates cited previously. The 
hazard rate for Arm 2 is 1.3 times the hazard rate for Arm 1. The median and 5 year survivals are computed 
from the hazard rates and illustrate the differences corresponding to the clinical significance criterion used to 
design the trial. The trial accrual time is computed from these specifications.    The trial size is the trial accrual 
time multiplied by the accrual rate for eligible patients. The total trial time is the sum of the computed accrual 
time and the specified follow-up period, and is the earliest the trial can be reported unless terminated early by 
the DMC.

Using the favored specifications (hazard rate of 0.0446 from the Fisher article and 5 years of follow-up prior 
to final analysis), the trial size is 1900 patients with a final report at 8.8 years following trial initiation.   

There will be five planned formal survival analyses including the final analysis, with an overall type I error 
probability of 0.05. These formal analyses will take place after each increment of 100 deaths, so that the final 
analysis is planned for 500 deaths. The first formal analysis is projected to be done 37 months following the 
start of accrual, and the next three will be done following the cessation of accrual at 54, 70, and 87 months 
after the start of accrual.    The final analysis is projected for 105 months (8.8 years) following the start of 
accrual. The one-tailed significance levels to be used to judge statistical significance at these formal analyses 
will be 0.0013, 0.0014, 0.0016, 0.0022, and 0.048, providing an overall one-tailed type I error probability of 
0.05. The results of the interim analyses will be used in deciding whether to terminate accrual (if applicable) 
or publish early in cases where Arm 2 is found to not have significantly worse survival than Arm 1 (the null 
hypothesis can be rejected). Should Arm 2 exhibit significantly worse survival than Arm 1, then ad hoc tests 
illustrating the likelihood of Arm 2 eventually having a better outcome will be presented to the DMC as an aid 
in deciding whether to terminate accrual (if applicable) or publish early based on the futility of Arm 2 ever 
exhibiting essentially equal or better survival than Arm 1. 

A fundamental assumption inherent in the design of this study is that the regional recurrence hazard rate will 
not be unacceptably high in women with a positive SN who do not undergo ALND. Nevertheless, the 
specification of what constitutes an unacceptably high regional recurrence hazard rate must take into account 
the following factors:   

(1)  It is expected that the regional recurrence hazard for Arm 2 (no ALND) will be higher than for 

Arm 1 where there has been an ALND.   

(2)  There will likely be significantly more morbidities associated with the ALND (Arm 1).   

(3)  There is evidence that a higher hazard rate for regional recurrence is not associated with an 

increase in the death hazard rate.   

(4)  The data on which crude estimates of the hazard rate for regional recurrence in women who do not 
have an ALND is based are not contemporary, were collected incidentally to the assessment of the 
issue of interest, do not have sufficient follow-up, and do not address the specific conditions of 
interest in this trial (no ALND when the SN is positive).   

 

These factors, and especially the factors which relate to judgment in the face of a trade-off between choices, 
mean that an attempt to specify a highly quantitative monitoring plan for the DMC relative to the issue of 
regional recurrence has a high degree of arbitrariness. Based on input fro m experts the guidance criterion for 
an excessively high regional recurrence rate is a regional recurrence hazard rate that would result in more than 
a 20% regional recurrences estimate at five years. The DMC will be provided with analyses of the regional 
recurrence rates at each meeting. It also will be provided with updates of the literature that has bearing on this 
issue. The DMC will treat the regional recurrence as a safety issue. It will base its deliberations on the data 
from this trial, other available data, and the guidance criterion specified.

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

The primary short-term outcome of interest is a comparison between the arms of the proportion of women 
having significant morbidity due to axillary surgery. The outcome for each woman will be dichotomous 
expression of whether a significant ALND-type side effect or complication has occurred. The occurrence of 
significant ALND-type side effects are defined as occurrence of any of the following side effects: 
lymphedema, pain in the axillary bed, loss of sensation, decreased range of motion, or infection. Let P A and PB 
be the proportion of women experiencing a significant ALND-type side effect (as defined in the previous 
sentence) in Arms 1 and 2, respectively. The primary analysis for this short-term outcome will be Fisher’s 
exact test for a difference between PA and PB. A worst-case approximate statistical power analysis is based on 
assuming that PA is 0.5. Assume a two-sided type I error probability of 0.05, 1900 eligible patients (950 per 
arm), and a difference of 8%.    Under these assumptions, the approximate statistical power is 93%. 
Exploratory logistic regression analyses of the probability of significant ALND-type side effects (and possibly 
the components of this composite outcome) using available covariates also will be performed.   

The DMC also will assess the adequacy of the accrual rate. The accrual rate estimate will be computed as the 
median of the monthly accruals in the previous three months. If the monthly accrual rate estimate based on this 
method following one year of accrual is not consistent with an accrual rate that would yield 500 patients per 
year, or if the trend in monthly accruals is not consistent with achieving 500 patients per year by the time of 18 
months of accrual, then the DMC will be asked to make recommendations regarding an accrual rate problem.   
These recommendations could address whether to continue the trial, suggestions of trial modifications 
designed to improve the accrual rate, or other trial modifications consistent with maximizing the likelihood of 
obtaining an answer to the primary question.   

Additional supporting and exploratory statistical models (proportional hazard regression and logistic 
regression) will be estimated with the primary focus of comparing the arms .    The primary additional outcome 
to be modeled is distant disease-free survival.    Additional candidate covariates include: tumor characteristics, 
tumor size, ICC bone marrow metastasis, histology, and menopausal status.   

11    Regulatory and Ethical Considerations   

11.1   

ACOSOG Membership   

The investigator intending to register a patient to this study must be a member in good standing of the 
American College of Surgeons Clinical Oncology Group (ACOSOG). The procedures for obtaining active 
status in ACOSOG are described in the membership information found on the ACOSOG web site at 
http://www.acosog.org.   

11.2   

NCI Investigator Registration   

All enrolling investigators must have an NCI investigator number and must maintain an “active” investigator 
registration status through the annual submission of a complete investigator registration packet (Form FDA 
1572 with original signature, current CV, Supplemental Investigator Data Form with original signature, and 
Financial Disclosure Form with original signature) to the Pharmaceutical Management Branch. These forms, 
along with completion and submission instructions, are available on the ACOSOG web site or by calling the 
PMB at 301496-5725 Monday through Friday between 8:30AM and 4:30PM Eastern time.   

11.3   

Clinical Site Eligibility   

The clinical site must be formally part of or affiliated with an institution that has active status in ACOSOG or, 
if this study is open for registration from other cooperative groups, the institution must have active status in 
the group permitted to register to this study.    If the institution has joined ACOSOG then notification of the 
successful application must have been issued at least 7 days before the first attempt at registration of a patient.   

11.4    OHRP Considerations   

An ACOSOG member must enroll patients at clinical sites that have a valid assurance number from the 
United States Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP). Most institutions have a Multiple Project 
Assurance (MPA), Cooperative Project Assurance (CPA) number or Federalwide Assurance (FWA).    If the 
clinical site does not have such an assurance, the clinical site must apply and obtain an assurance before 
patients can be enrolled to ACOSOG studies.   

Unaffiliated Investigator Agreements (UIAs) are needed from investigators who independently accrue 
patients on ambulatory protocols outside an institution (e.g., in private practice) but who rely on an 
institution’s IRB for review of ACOSOG protocols.   

Z0011 A9

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

Information on applying for a FWA may be obtained from the ACOSOG Coordinating Center, by referring 
to ACOSOG SOP “Applying for OHRP Assurance”, or by directly contacting OHRP.   

11.5   

Institutional Review Board Approval   

It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that this protocol is reviewed and approved by the appropriate 
IRB. Each clinical site must obtain a letter of approval from the IRB (full board review) prior to screening and 
registering patients to this study as defined by the following:   

 

Federal Regulatory Guidelines (Federal Register Vol. 46, 8975, January 27, 1981 as amended in 
Federal Register Vol. 56, 28029, June 18, 1991 and in Federal Register Vol. 66, 56775, November 
13, 2001).   

  Office of Protection for Research Risks Report: Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal 

 

Regulations Title 45, Part 46).   

The IRB also must review and approve the site’s informed consent document and any other written 
information provided to the patient prior to its use.   

Participating investigators are required to submit a copy of the IRB document indicating approval of the 
protocol and the consent form as well as a copy of the IRB-approved consent form prior to registering the first 
patient. For instructions on the submission of these documents, please refer to the IRB Approval SOP (IRB 
App) found on the ACOSOG web site at http://www.acosog.org/.   

If, during the study, it is necessary to amend either the protocol or informed consent document, the 
investigator will be responsible for ensuring the IRB reviews and approves the amended documents. IRB 
approval of the amended informed consent document must be obtained before new patients consent to 
participate in the study using this version of the consent.   

11.6   

Informed Consent   

11.6.1   

ACOSOG Preparation of the Model Informed Consent Document   

In August 1998, the NCI, the Office for Protection from Research Risks (now OHRP), and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) formed the NCI Informed Consent Working Group. The group prepared a document 
with a corresponding template called the “Recommendations for the Development of Informed Consent 
Documents for Cancer Clinical Trials” (see http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov or 
http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/oct98/nci-22.htm).    The NCI requires that this template must be used in the 
creation of model informed consent documents for all ACOSOG studies.   

11.6.2   

Adaptation of the Model Informed Consent Document   

For each protocol, the ACOSOG provides a model informed consent document in a file form that can be 
downloaded for inclusion into a chosen word processing system.    The Informed Consent SOP (InfCon SOP) 
discusses how to adapt the model informed consent document for local use. This model informed consent has 
been approved for use by the DCT/NCI, and is the only consent document approved for this study. All 
required elements and NCI required text must be included when adapting the model informed consent to 
include site-specific text requirements. Local IRB adaptations and editorial changes of this document are 
allowed as long as the meaning or intent of the section is not changed.   

When the model informed consent for an ACOSOG protocol is adapted to local requirements, it is the 
responsibility of that institution to ensure that protocol procedures, especially risks, AEs, and treatment 
choices, are fully and accurately represented in the local informed consent to be used at the institution.   

11.6.3   

Informed Consent Process   

The investigator or his/her authorized designee will inform the patient or the patient’s legally authorized 
representative of all aspects pertaining to the patient’s participation in the study.   

The process for obtaining informed consent will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements. The informed consent document must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s 
legally authorized representative BEFORE the patient can participate in the study. In addition, the 
investigator will ensure that there is compliance with all institutional requirements for consent form 
execution. The patient will receive a copy of the consent, and the original will be retained according to local 
requirements.

Protocol Z0011 

11.7   

Protection of Patient Rights   

11.7.1   

Protection from Unnecessary Harm   

Each clinical site is responsible for protecting all patients involved in human experimentation. This is 
accomplished through the IRB mechanism and the process of informed consent.    The IRB reviews all 
proposed studies involving human experimentation and ensures that the patient’s rights and welfare are 
protected and that the potential benefits and/or the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweigh the 
risks to the individual. The IRB also reviews the Informed Consent document associated with each study in 
order to ensure that the consent document accurately and clearly communicates the nature of the research to be 
done and its associated risks and benefits. The IRB must give full board approval of the protocol and consent 
documents before the study may begin at a site.   

11.7.2   

Confidentiality of Patient Data   

The clinical site is responsible for the confidentiality of the data associated with patients registered in this 
study in the same manner it is responsible for the confidentiality of any patient data within its sphere of 
responsibility. For patients registered to this study, there are additional considerations related to the necessity 
of sharing of research data with the ACOSOG Coordinating Center and representatives of NCI and OHRP.   

The Privacy Rule (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 160 and 164) created as a result of the 
enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) protects the privacy of 
individually identifiable health information. The rule’s requirements also heighten the protection of patient 
information by introducing more controls on its use and disclosure.    HIPAA refers to patient information as 
“protected health information” (PHI). PHI includes any information that could identify a person, living or dead. 
To comply with HIPAA’s Privacy Rule, the patient is required to authorize the use and disclosure of his/her 
PHI by either signing a HIPAA-compliant informed consent document or a separate authorization form created 
for this purpose. The provisions of the Privacy Rule do not negate the other federal regulations that govern the 
protection of patient’s rights relative to data confidentiality and the use of research data.   

11.8   

Inclusion of Women and Minorities   

The ACOSOG has no data and therefore has no direct evidence regarding the potential for there to be 
minority-specific effects for the types of patients expected to be enrolled on this study.    No literature has 
been identified that addresses the issue of conclusive minority-specific effects for the issues addressed in this 
study. A survey of many of the protocols currently accruing cooperative group phase III breast cancer studies 
was done.    The purpose of this survey was to ascertain whether any of these protocols discuss design features 
based on data showing an expectation of minority-specific effects for any of the issues addressed in these 
studies, even though these studies tend to address the issues of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. The 
background sections of these protocols often report recent analyses addressing minority-specific effects. 
There were no conclusive data cited or expectations discussed for minority-specific effects.   

The ACOSOG has no data and therefore has no basis for projecting the proportions of minority patients to be 
expected. Therefore, the ACOSOG will base its accrual projection on the projections used in another 
cooperative group.    In the Southwest Oncology Group study S9623, the following proportional allocation of 
accrual was used. The projected accrual for this study is based on the Southwest Oncology group experience:   

Race Category   
American Indian or Alaska Native   
Asian or Pacific Islander   
Black, not of Hispanic Origin   
Hispanic   
White, not of Hispanic Origin   
Other or Unknown   
Total   

% Accrual   

Projected Accrual   

0   
0   
9   
5   
84   
2   

100   

0   
0   

171   
95   

1596   

38   

1900   

 

The ACOSOG has implemented initiatives to promote the recru itment of minority surgeons and patients into 
ACOSOG and such initiatives are likely to be in place soon after this study begins accrual and may increase 
minority participation.   

Men are excluded from this study because the number of men with breast cancer is insufficient to provide a 
statistical basis for assessment of effects in this subpopulation of people with breast cancer.

Protocol Z0011 

11.9   

Clinical Site Audits   

All clinical sites at which patients are enrolled are subject to an on-site audit by ACOSOG in accordance with 
guidelines provided by and available from the Clinical Trials Monitoring Branch (CTMB) of the NCI. 
Information on these regulations may be obtained from the CTMB web site at http://ctep.cancer.gov/.   

11.10    Clinical Monitoring   

This study will be monitored by the current version of the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS). Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due January 31, April 30, 
July 31, and October 31.   

12    Surgeon Skill Verification   
There are no skill verification procedures for this study.   

13    Performance Monitoring   

If, based upon the materials submitted, or during participation on this study, an investigator has a possible 
performance issue, the ACOSOG study committee will review the issues and make recommendations based on 
its findings to the investigator. It is expected that in most cases, the study committee will work with the 
investigator to improve performance. However, the study chair and the ACOSOG study committee are 
empowered to suspend protocol participation, if necessary.

Registration / Ramdomization   

Before recruitment of a patient for this study, investigators must be registered members of the CTSU. Each 
investigator must have an NCI investigator number and must maintain an “active” investigator registration 
status through the annual submission of a complete investigator registration packet (FDA Form 1572 with 
original signature, current CV, Supplemental Investigator Data Form with signature, and Financial Disclosure 
Form with original signature) to the Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP, DCTD, NCI. These forms are 
available on the CTSU registered member Web site or by calling the PMB at 301-496-5725 Monday through 
Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.   

Each CTSU investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this protocol 
and submit all IRB/regulatory documents to the CTSU Regulatory Office before patient enrollments may 
proceed. All forms and documents associated with this study can be downloaded from the ACOSOG-Z0011 
Web page on the CTSU registered member Web site (http://www.ctsu.org). Patients can be registered only 
after pre-treatment evaluation is complete, all eligibility criteria have been met, and all pertinent forms and 
documents are approved and on file with the CTSU.

MODEL CONSENT FORM FOR ACOSOG STUDY Z0011   

A randomized trial of axillary node dissection in women with clinical 

T1 or T2 N0 M0 breast cancer who have a positive sentinel node   

WHY AM IBEING ASKED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?   

You are being asked to take part in this study because you have what is known as “early stage” 
breast cancer that has spread to one of the first few lymph nodes that drain lymphatic fluid from the 
area around your breast cancer.   

It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part in this study.    Please read this consent form 
carefully. Take your time making your decision. We encourage you to talk with your doctor, family, 
and friends before you decide.   

WHO IS CONDUCTING THIS STUDY?   

This study is a clinical trial conducted by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group 
(ACOSOG). Clinical trials are research studies designed to find better ways to treat diseases like 
cancer.   

(The local institution is responsible for supplying information as to who is conducting the trial locally, suggested 

content should include the name of contact at the local institution, with phone number and address.)   

WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?   

Today, standard medical practice is to look for possible spread of breast cancer to your lymph nodes 
with an operation called an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). This operation removes lymph 
nodes from the middle and lower armpit on the side in which you have cancer. These lymph nodes 
are called the axillary nodes.   

Many research studies have shown that removal of the axillary nodes may not affect how long a 
patient lives. ALND is important because it lets your doctor know if you have cancer cells in your 
axillary nodes. Your doctor may use this information to decide on the type of treatment 
(chemotherapy or hormonal therapy) you receive after your breast cancer surgery. Another possible 
benefit of ALND is that it may decrease the risk of cancer coming back in your armpit. The number 
of axillary lymph nodes that must be removed to give your doctor enough information to decide on 
treatment options is not known. The number of axillary lymph nodes that must be removed to reduce 
the risk of cancer coming back in your armpit also is not known.   

Z0011 A9

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is a new procedure that locates and removes the few lymph 
nodes to which the lymphatic fluid from the tumor site first drains. These lymph nodes are called 
the sentinel nodes. A patient will usually have from 1 to 4 sentinel nodes. If tumor cells spread, they 
will usually be found in the sentinel nodes.   

Researchers do not know if removing most of your axillary nodes with an ALND is any better than 
removing just the sentinel nodes. It is possible that SLND is just as good as ALND in the treatment 
of women with “early stage” breast cancer even when their sentinel nodes contain cancer cells 
(“positive sentinel nodes”). It is important to find this out because SLND is a less invasive surgical 
procedure with fewer surgical side effects than ALND. The only way to see which operation is better 
is to study the procedures in a large group of women who have “early stage” breast cancer.   

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?   

This research study has several goals:   

  To see if women who undergo SLND have the same long-term outcome as women who have 

an ALND even when the sentinel nodes contain cancer cells. We hope that this information 
will allow surgeons to decide if SLND can safely replace ALND in this situation.   

  To compare the surgical side effects of SLND with those of ALND.   

 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?   

About 1,900 women from many cancer treatment centers will take part in this study.

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

Your doctor will explain both the SLND and ALND procedures to you. You should ask your doctor 
any questions you may have about these procedures.   

At the time of your SLND:   

 

 

 

If your sentinel nodes show evidence of cancer on routine examination, you will be eligible 
for this study which compares SLND to ALND;   
If your sentinel nodes do not show evidence of cancer on routine examination, you will not 
be eligible for this study; or   
If a sentinel lymph node cannot be found, you will not be eligible for this study   

 
If you decide to join this study:   
You will be randomly assigned (by a process called randomization) to one of two groups: the SLND 
Group or the ALND Group. This means that a computer program will put you in the SLND Group or 
the ALND Group by chance. Neither you nor your doctor will choose which group you are in. You 
will have an equal chance of being placed in either of the two groups.   

If you are in the SLND Group: Your sentinel nodes will be located and removed at the time 
your SLND is performed. No additional axillary lymph nodes will be removed. Your doctor 
will explain the procedures he or she uses to find sentinel nodes. Your doctor may use a 
radioactive tracer and/or blue dye procedure to locate your sentinel nodes. Research studies 
have shown that the radioactive tracer and/or blue dye procedure can accurately identify 
sentinel nodes in at least 95% of patients.    You should ask your doctor any questions you 
may have about the procedures he or she uses to locate sentinel nodes.   

If you are in the ALND Group: An ALND will be performed after your SLND is complete. 
Your doctor will remove the lymph nodes that are in the middle and lower areas of your 
armpit on the side in which you have breast cancer.   

Your doctor also will explain the timing of your randomization. Your doctor will use either 
“post-operative” randomization or “intra-operative” randomization.   

In “post-operative” randomization, the pathologist will examine your sentinel nodes for cancer 
after your sentinel lymph node surgery is over. The pathologist will use a technique called 
permanent analysis or Hematoxylin and Eosin staining. This test takes several days to obtain 
results.   

If the pathologist finds cancer in your sentinel nodes, you will be randomized to either the SLND 
Group or the ALND Group. If you are in the SLND Group, no further surgery will be done. If you 
are in the ALND Group, yo ur doctor will remove the lymph nodes in the middle and lower areas of 
your armpit in a second operation.   

Z0011 A9 

 

39 

ACOSOG 

Protocol Z0011 

In “intra-operative” randomization, the pathologist will examine your sentinel nodes immediately 
following your sentinel lymph node surgery while you are still in the operating room. The 
pathologist will use a technique called frozen section analysis or a technique called “touch prep”. If 
the pathologist finds cancer in your sentinel nodes, you will be randomized while still in the 
operating room. If you are in the SLND Group, no more lymph nodes will be removed. If you are in 
the ALND Group, your doctor will remove the lymph nodes in the middle and lower areas of your 
armpit at that time.   

The pathologist also will examine your sentinel nodes using permanent analysis when your surgery 
is over. About 10-15% of patients who do not have cancer in their sentinel nodes detected by frozen 
section or “touch prep” will have cancer detected by permanent analysis. If you are one of these 
patients, you will be randomized to either the SLND Group or the ALND Group when these results 
become available. If you are in the SLND Group, no further surgery will be done. If you are in the 
ALND Group, your doctor will remove the lymph nodes in the middle and lower areas of your 
armpit in a second operation.   

You should ask your doctor any questions you may have about the timing of 
randomization he or she uses for the Z0011 study.   

WHAT ABOUT MY TREATMENT AFTER SURGERY?   

Treatment given after surgery is called adjuvant therapy.    Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer can 
include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and/or radiation therapy. After your surgery, you will 
receive 25-28 treatments of radiation to your involved breast.    It will usually be given once a day for 
five days a week (except Saturday and Sunday) for 5 to 5½ weeks. In addition, your doctor may 
advise you to receive additional adjuvant treatment for your cancer after your surgery.

HOW LONG WILL IBE IN THE STUDY?   

We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life to look at the 
long-term effects of the procedures you will receive in this study.    Your doctor may decide to take 
you off study if:   

  Your medical condition changes, or   
  New information becomes available affecting your willingness to rema in in the study.   

 
In addition, your participation in the study may end because ACOSOG finds it must limit or stop 
the study. You also can stop taking part in the study at any time. If you decide to withdraw from the 
study, you should talk with your doctor first.   

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF BEING IN THE STUDY?   

You are at risk for certain side effects while in the study. You should discuss them with your doctor. 
There may be other side effects that we cannot predict. Your doctor may be able to offer medical 
treatment to make your side effects less serious and uncomfortable.    Many side effects go away 
shortly after treatment ends, but in some cases side effects can be serious, long lasting, or permanent. 
Please talk with your doctor about these side effects.   

The risks and side effects for the SLND and ALND procedures you may undergo as part of this 
study are listed below. Likely side effects are those that occur in more than 5% of patients who 
undergo the procedure. Unlikely side effects are those that occur in 5% or less of patients 
undergoing these procedures.   

For Radioactive Tracer Injection Associated with SLND, risks and side effects include: 

Likely 

Unlikely 

 

Infection at the injection site 

  Allergic reaction to the injected solution 

  Exposure to radiation (equal to 1/10th to 

1/20th of the annual exposure the average

  Scarring and/or indentation of your skin in 
the area of the incision (may be permanent) 

Other Potential Risks of SLND:   

 

  Breast or axillary wound infection (may be 

serious). If this occurs, it usually happens 
within 2 weeks after surgery. 

  Bleeding or development of a hematoma (a 

localized blood-filled swelling) in the area of 
the surgery (rarely serious) 

 

In approximately 5% of SLNDs, the sentinel nodes may not accurately reflect the status of the 
rest of the lymph nodes in the armpit. It is possible that removing only the sentinel nodes could 
leave some cancer cells behind. These cells may be destroyed by adjuvant therapy you receive 
(chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and/or radiation therapy). It also is possible that these cells 
will grow in the future and require further surgery and/or therapy.   

  Chronic lymphedema is swelling of the arm on the side of the surgery that does not go away. This 

can be serious. Chronic lymphedema from SLND has not been reported to date.   

 
For the Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND), risks and side effects include:   

Likely 
  Time away from work 
  Pain 
  Mild edema or swelling in your breast and 

arm that is temporary 

Unlikely 

  Chronic lymphedema (may be serious). 

This is swelling of the arm on the side of 
the surgery that does not go away. 

  Feeling of numbness in the arm that does 

  Loss of feeling or touch at the incision site

Added: Each inclusion and exclusion criterion must be evaluated and documented in the patient’s 
medical record.    Patient eligibility must be determined by the investigator.   

Deleted 2nd and 3rd sentences 2nd paragraph: An investigator who is registering patients to this 
study before performance of the SLND (intra-operative randomization) also should register 
these patients to the ACOSOG Z0010 study, if possible. However, this is not required. Deleted last

Added section: For this study, patients will be staged according to the AJCC Cancer Staging 
Manual, 5th edition, 1997 (See Appendix for Staging Reference). NOTE: In the 5th edition, specific 
criteria for micrometastatic lymph node deposits are not defined. Although the 6th edition of the 
AJCC Cancer staging manual defines micrometastases as tumor deposits greater than 0.2mm but 
not greater than 2.0mm in largest dimension, this definition is not used to determine eligibility for 
Z0011. Therefore, for this study, a SLN with a micrometastatic tumor deposit < 0.2mm will also be 
considered a positive SLN.   

Changed from: This section applies to clinical sites that have both ACOSOG study Z0010 and 
study Z0011 open. Changed to: This section applies to clinical sites that have both ACOSOG Study 
Z0010 and Study Z0011 open. Deleted last sentence 1st paragraph: Clinical sites are requested to 
register patients participating in Z0011 to Z0010 as well, whenever possible. Deleted 2nd 
paragraph: Patients who are to be registered to both Z0010 and Z0011 must sign a separate 
informed consent for each study.    For patients to be randomized intra-operatively to Z0011, the 
patient must sign the informed consent for Z0011 prior to the surgeon performing the SLND for 
Z0010. To randomize a patient post-operatively to Z0011, sites should assess a patient’s eligibility 
to Z0011 after completion of SLND for Z0010 and obtain informed consent for Z0011. Then, sites 
should register the patient to Z0011 and obtain randomized arm. Added 2nd paragraph: The accrual 
goal for ACOSOG Study Z0010 was met and the study was permanently closed to accrual on 
5/30/2003. All patients currently on the study must continue to be followed according to protocol 
specifications. Annual IRB review and approval of the protocol and consent form must continue 
until all registered patients have completed the follow-up phase of the study.   

Changed from: A patient with tumors located in the medial hemisphere of the breast that show a 
complete absence of drainage to the axilla by lymphoscintigram or by absence of elevated gamma 
counts will be discontinued from the study and will not be followed. Changed to: A patient with 
tumors located in the medial hemisphere of the breast that show a complete absence of drainage to 
the axilla by lymphoscintigram or by absence of elevated axillary lymph node gamma counts will 
be discontinued from the study and will not be followed.   

Deleted: Refer to the ACOSOG Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines at http://www.acosog.org for 
additional information.

Deleted last sentence 1st paragraph: The patient grants permission to share research data with these 
entities in the consent document. Federal regulations govern the protection of patient’s rights 
relative to data confidentiality and use of research data. 
Added 2nd paragraph: The Privacy Rule (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 160 and 164) 
created as a result of the enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA) protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information. The rule’s 
requirements also heighten the protection of patient information by introducing more controls on 

its use and disclosure. HIPAA refers to patient information as “protected health information” (PHI). 
PHI includes any information that could identify a person, living or dead. To comply with HIPAA’s 
Privacy Rule, the patient is required to authorize the use and disclosure of his/her PHI by either 
signing a HIPAA compliant informed consent document or a separate authorization form created 
for this purpose. The provisions of the Privacy Rule do not negate the other federal regulations that 
govern the protection of patient’s rights relative to data confidentiality and the use of research data.
