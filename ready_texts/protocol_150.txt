A Randomized Phase 3 Study of Pemetrexed in 

Combination with Cisplatin Versus Cisplatin 

Monotherapy in Patients with Recurrent or Metastatic 

Head and Neck Cancer 

1. 

Introduction 

Indication 

1.1. 
Head and neck cancer (HNC) that is recurrent and not amenable to local therapy (surgery 
or radiation) or newly diagnosed distant metastatic disease. 

1.2.  Study Rationale 

1.2.1.  Head and Neck Cancer:  Disease Overview 
Head and neck cancer refers to a heterogeneous collection of malignancies arising in the 
upper aerodigestive tract, including squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity (buccal 
mucosa, upper and lower alveolar ridges, retromolar trigone, hard palate, anterior 
two-thirds of the tongue, and the floor of the mouth), pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx, 
and hypopharynx), and larynx. 

The most common risk factors for HNC are tobacco and alcohol use, with concomitant 
use conferring even higher risk   Occupational risk factors include nickel refining, 
woodworking, and exposure to textile fibers.  Additionally, DNA from the Epstein-Barr 
virus has been identified in human nasopharyngeal cancer tissue, and DNA from the 
human papilloma virus has been identified in more than 50% of oropharyngeal cancer 
tissues (Forastiere et al. 2001). 

1.2.2.  Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer 
Recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancers are generally incurable 
and are associated with poor survival.  Palliative chemotherapy is usually offered to 
patients with recurrent or distant metastatic disease that is recognized as incurable and 
not amenable to local therapy.  The median survival with chemotherapy is approximately 
6 months, with a 1-year survival rate of approximately 20% (Forastiere et al. 2005). 

Until the early 1980s, single-agent methotrexate (with response rates of 10% to 35% and 
median duration of response of approximately 2 to 5 months) was the standard agent for 
palliation of patients with advanced HNC.  Two small, randomized trials later established 
that cisplatin monotherapy has efficacy comparable with that of methotrexate 
monotherapy (based on response rate and median response duration), as well as a

Redacted Version Page 13 

manageable toxicity profile in patients with advanced HNC (Hong et al. 1983; Grose et 
al. 1985). 

In 1985, Morton and colleagues reported the results of a Phase 3 study in which 
116 patients with advanced HNC were randomized to 4 treatment arms:  (1) no active 
treatment (control) (2) cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every month (3) bleomycin 15 mg/day for 5 
consecutive days every month or (4) the combination arm of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 
month plus bleomycin 15 mg/day for 5 consecutive days every month (Morton et al. 
1985).  The primary aim of this study was to demonstrate a significant prolongation of 
the 11-week median survival in this group of patients.  In this study, the only significant 
prolongations of survival were for the 2 groups receiving cisplatin (single-agent cisplatin 
versus control, p<0.05; two cisplatin arms versus 2 noncisplatin arms, p<0.01), with a 
prolongation of median survival by 10 weeks.  Single-agent cisplatin almost reached 
significance over cisplatin plus bleomycin combination therapy (p=0.065).  The response 
rate was higher in the combination arm (24%) than in either single-agent arm (cisplatin:  
13%; bleomycin:  14%), although the difference was not statistically significant. 

Because of the higher response rate and significantly improved survival observed by 
Morton and colleagues with cisplatin therapy, a variety of antineoplastic agents were 
subsequently studied in combination with cisplatin in patients with advanced HNC.  
However, cisplatin combination chemotherapy has not shown statistically significant 
improvement in survival when compared to single-agent treatments (refer to Table 
JMHR.1), with median survival durations for single-agent cisplatin ranging from 5 to 8 
months.

1.2.3.  Rationale for Use of Pemetrexed in Head and Neck 

Cancer 

1.2.3.1.  Mechanism of Action 
Pemetrexed is transported into cells by a reduced folate carrier and folate-binding protein 
(Theti and Jackman 2004).  Upon entry into the cell, pemetrexed undergoes 
polyglutamation by the action of the enzyme folylpolyglutamyl synthetase (Habeck et al. 
1995).  The polyglutamated metabolites of pemetrexed have prolonged intracellular

retention times and are believed to play a profound role in determining the clinical 
antitumor activity of this novel agent. 

Studies have demonstrated that pemetrexed and its polyglutamate forms are potent 
competitive inhibitors of several key folate-requiring enzymes, including thymidylate 
synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase.  Inhibition of TS and DHFR is the primary mechanism of action of 2 
agents commonly used in the management of HNC patients:  5-FU and methotrexate.  
The polyglutamates of pemetrexed also inhibit other folate-requiring enzymes, such as 
aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, C-1 tetrahydrofolate 
synthase, and C-1 tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase.  The combined effects of the enzyme 
inhibition exerted by pemetrexed at each target give rise to an unusual end product 
reversal pattern and signature on metabolic folate and nucleotide pools, which are 
different from any other antifolates that have been studied so far (Shih et al. 1997).  Thus, 
pemetrexed represents a new class of antifolate cytotoxic agents with the promise of 
better overcoming inherent drug resistance through its multitargeted mechanism of 
action. 

1.2.3.2.  Development of Pemetrexed 

1.2.3.2.1.  Single-Agent Pemetrexed 
Early Phase 1 studies of pemetrexed without vitamin supplementation (conducted in 
patients with a variety of refractory solid malignancies) established the treatment 
schedule of pemetrexed administered once every 3 weeks.  The maximum-tolerated dose 
(MTD) for this regimen was 700 mg/m2, with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue.  The dose selected for Phase 2 studies was 
600 mg/m2.  Later, to decrease the toxicity reported in the early Phase 2 studies, the 
recommended Phase 2 dose was decreased to 500 mg/m2, before the institution of routine 
folic acid and vitamin B12 administration.   

Based upon multivariate analyses of toxicities observed in several pemetrexed trials 
(Niyikiza et al. 2002), all patients receiving pemetrexed were subsequently supplemented 
with dietary folic acid (350 to 1000 Âµg) and vitamin B12 (1000 Âµg, administered as an 
intramuscular injection) to decrease the frequency of severe hematologic and 
nonhematologic toxicity.  Vitamin B12 was included in the supplementation because 
approximately 15% of patients were not expected to achieve lower homocysteine levels 
with the supplementation of daily folic acid alone.  It was hypothesized that these patients 
might benefit from the addition of vitamin B12 because this agent is a cofactor in the 
consumption of homocysteine by the methionine synthase enzyme. 

Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation caused a statistically significant reduction in 
plasma homocysteine concentrations over time and a significant reduction in the 
frequencies of severe hematologic toxicities and nonhematologic toxicities, such as 
mucositis, in patients receiving pemetrexed therapy (Bunn et al. 2001).

The randomized Phase 3 trial, Study H3E-MC-JMEI (JMEI), confirmed the safety and 
tolerability of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with vitamin supplementation compared with 
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) who were previously treated with chemotherapy.  Overall, Study JMEI 
showed that pemetrexed was as efficacious as docetaxel and had a more favorable safety 
profile.  The more favorable safety profile for pemetrexed was reflected in fewer 
clinically relevant toxicities, particularly neutropenia-related toxicities and associated 
supportive care (hospitalizations and concomitant medications), as well as fewer 
discontinuations and drug-related adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs).  
Three study-drug-related deaths occurred on the pemetrexed arm, and 5 occurred on the 
docetaxel arm (Hanna et al. 2004). 

Pemetrexed is approved as second-line monotherapy for the treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in the United States (US) and in the European 
Union (EU). 

1.2.3.2.2.  Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin 
Study H3E-MC-JMAP (JMAP) was a single-center, nonrandomized, open-label, Phase 1 
study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin without vitamin supplementation in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic cancer to determine the MTD of pemetrexed and cisplatin 
administered in combination intravenously on a 21-day cycle.  No patients received 
low-dose folic acid or vitamin B12 because this study was completed before vitamin 
supplementation was implemented.  The primary cancers most frequently seen in these 
patients were mesothelioma (13 patients), HNC (11 patients), and non-small cell lung 
cancer (7 patients).  Seven patients (17%) had a performance status of 2.  Forty-five 
percent of the patients had received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen.  The MTD 
was pemetrexed 600 mg/m2 and cisplatin 100 mg/m2, because 2 of the 6 patients treated 
at this dose level experienced protocol-defined DLTs:  1 patient developed Grade 3 
mucositis and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and 1 patient experienced Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia.  At the next lower dose level (pemetrexed 600 mg/m2 and cisplatin 
75 mg/m2), only 1 of 13 patients had a protocol-defined DLT (Grade 3 neutropenia).  The 
data from this trial would have led to a dose of pemetrexed 600 mg/m2 and cisplatin 
75 mg/m2 being recommended for Phase 2 study.  However, because of toxicities 
observed in other single-agent Phase 2 studies, the recommended Phase 2 dose for this 
combination became pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2. 

The pivotal, randomized, Phase 3 trial, Study H3E-MC-JMCH (JMCH), established the 
safety and tolerability of the addition of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with vitamin 
supplementation to cisplatin 75 mg/m2, compared with single-agent cisplatin 75 mg/m2 
in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).  Few patients discontinued 
because of adverse events (12%).  Among patients who received vitamin 
supplementation, the drug-related death rate was low and similar between arms; all 
drug-related deaths in Study JMCH occurred in patients who did not receive vitamin

supplementation.  The main toxicities of this regimen were hematologic (28% Grade 3 or 
4 neutropenia), but clinical manifestations of neutropenia, such as febrile neutropenia, 
were rare (<2%).  Grade 3 or 4 nonlaboratory toxicities, such as diarrhea and mucositis, 
which are common with other TS inhibitors, were observed in less than 5% of patients 
who received the pemetrexed plus cisplatin regimen.  Furthermore, the toxicity profile of 
the combination regimen of pemetrexed plus cisplatin was improved with folic acid and 
vitamin B12 supplementation.  Although the toxicity of pemetrexed in combination with 
cisplatin was higher than that of cisplatin alone, the increased toxicity was offset by the 
associated significant improvements in overall survival (OS), time to disease progression, 
response rate, pulmonary functioning, and pain in patients with MPM treated with 
pemetrexed and cisplatin (Vogelzang et al. 2003). 

Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is approved in the US and the EU for the 
treatment of patients with MPM whose disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not 
candidates for curative surgery. 

Study H3E-MC-JMDB (JMDB) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 
study for first-line treatment of chemonaive patients with advanced/metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with pemetrexed and cisplatin (PC) versus gemcitabine and 
cisplatin (GC).  The requirement for patientâs calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) value 
in Study JMDB was â¥ 45 mL/min based on the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula 
(1976).  Of the 812 patients in PC arm who were randomized and treated at baseline, 65 
patients had CrCl of 45 to <60 mL/min  low CrCl group), and 747 had CrCl â¥ 60 mL/min 
(high CrCl group).  Clinically significant SAEs were similar between the low CrCl group 
and the high CrCl group, including renal toxicities.  When comparing all treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), the low CrCl group demonstrated more TEAEs 
involving renal toxicities, such as blood creatinine increase 10.8% versus 6% for high 
CrCl group, creatinine renal clearance decrease 26.2% versus 2%, and blood creatinine 
3.1% versus 0.54%.  Dose delays due to renal toxicities were also observed to be higher 
in the low CrCl group as compared to the high CrCl group, such as creatinine renal 
clearance decrease 10.8% versus 0.4% for high CrCl group.  All other reasons for dose 
delays were similar between the 2 groups.  Discontinuations due to SAEs and nonserious, 
clinically significant adverse event were 11 (16.9%) patients for the low CrCl group 
versus 57 (7.6%) patients for the high CrCl group; discontinuations for the low CrCl 
group were all related to renal events.  As expected, there were increased dose delays and 
discontinuations due to renal events in the low CrCl group.  However, most of the TEAEs 
observed in the low CrCl group were of Grade 1 or 2, and there was no increase in 
clinically significant SAEs.  Patients with CrCl of 45 to <60 mL/min did not exhibit 
significant increase in toxicity as compared to patients with CrCl â¥ 60 mL/min.  This is 
consistent with pemetrexed label to date.  Therefore, the calculated CrCl for Study JMHR 
patients will be â¥ 45 mL/min. 

Investigational sites involved in Study JMDB were also invited to participate in an 
optional companion biomarker research protocol.  Prospective analyses from the trial 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

Redacted Version Page 18 

have been performed comparing OS and progression-free survival (PFS) by histologic 
type (squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC) (Scagliotti et al. 2007, 2008).  Statistically 
significant treatment-by-histology interactions were observed, with greater OS and PFS 
exhibited in patients treated with pemetrexed/cisplatin and having nonsquamous 
histology when compared to patients with squamous cell histology (Scagliotti et al. 2007, 
2008). 

Therefore, as part of Lillyâs ongoing efforts to understand the relationship between 
cancer, genetics, and response to therapy, Study JMHR will analyze biomarkers that will 
predict response to pemetrexed and cisplatin.  Study JMHR will also analyze the potential 
correlation between biomarkers and differences in underlying tumor cell type. 

1.2.3.3.  Development of Pemetrexed for Patients with Head and Neck 

Cancer 

1.2.3.3.1.  Single-Agent Pemetrexed for Patients with Head and Neck 

Cancer 

As a part of a broad Phase 2 program, pemetrexed was studied as a single agent in 
advanced HNC patients (Study H3E-MC-JMAJ [JMAJ]).  In this single-arm, Phase 2 
study of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 without vitamin supplementation, a response rate of 
27% was observed in 36 patients with advanced HNC.  Approximately 30% of patients 
had received prior chemotherapy, and the majority had prior surgery and/or radiotherapy.  
Median PFS was 3.1 months, and median survival time was 6.4 months.  Toxicity was 
graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 1 (NCI 1993).  Grade 3/4 
neutropenia was reported for 65% of patients, and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was 
observed in 11.4%.  Grade 3/4 infection was observed in 17.1% of patients.  Four deaths 
were attributed to toxicity from study treatment (asphyxia secondary to laryngeal 
hemorrhage, septic shock, septicemia, as well as laryngeal tumor bleeding and dyspnea). 

1.2.3.3.2.  Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin for Patients with Head and Neck 

Cancer 

In Study JMAP (see Section 1.2.3.2.2), 3 of the 11 patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic HNC were observed to have a partial response to study treatment. 

1.2.3.4.  Summary and Conclusions 
Thus, the rationale for the development of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin in 
advanced HNC is as follows: 

â¢  Because no platinum-based combination has improved survival in patients 

with advanced HNC compared with single-agent cisplatin, there is a 
significant unmet medical need in this patient population. 

â¢  Phase 2 data established the activity of single-agent pemetrexed 

500 mg/m2 without vitamin supplementation in advanced HNC patients. 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b) 
Confidential 

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 19 

â¢  The addition of vitamin supplementation to pemetrexed treatment led to a 

manageable and predictable toxicity profile for pemetrexed and for 
pemetrexed plus cisplatin. 

â¢  Pemetrexed with vitamin supplementation plus cisplatin showed 

significant improvements in OS, with acceptable toxicity, compared with 
single-agent cisplatin in Study JMCH, a randomized, Phase 3 trial that led 
to the global registration of pemetrexed plus cisplatin combination therapy 
in patients with MPM. 

â¢  Experience gained with pemetrexed in a variety of tumors, including 

HNC, provides evidence that pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin 
with vitamin supplementation can be safely administered in this patient 
population. 

â¢  Pemetrexed, either as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin, has 

shown promising activity in patients with advanced HNC.

2.  Objectives 

2.1.  Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the OS of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus 
cisplatin 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks to the OS of single-agent cisplatin 75 mg/m2 every 3 
weeks in patients with HNC that is recurrent and not amenable to local therapy (surgery 
or radiation) or newly diagnosed distant metastatic disease. 

2.2.  Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study are to compare between the two treatment arms: 

â¢  progression-free survival (PFS) 
â¢  overall response rate (ORR) 
â¢  duration of response (DoR) for responding patients 
â¢ 

time to worsening (TTW) in dimensions of health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and 
Neck Cancer (FACT-H&N) 

â¢  change from baseline in dimensions of HRQoL using FACT-H&N 
â¢ 

the safety and adverse event profile (including Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE Version 3.0, NCI 2003] grades for 
laboratory and nonlaboratory adverse events) 

â¢ 

to assess the ability of biological markers relevant to study therapy and 
disease state to identify difference in treatment effect on overall survival 
and on other relevant clinical endpoints including PFS, tumor response, 
and toxicity. 

Definitions for efficacy, HRQoL, and safety measures can be found in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 
and 6.3, respectively.

Investigational Plan 

Page 21 

3.1.  Summary of Study Design 
Study H3E-MC-JMHR (JMHR) is a double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 study in patients 
with HNC that is recurrent and not amenable to local therapy (surgery or radiation) or 
newly diagnosed distant metastatic disease.  Approximately 790 patients will be enrolled 
in this study.  Eligible patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment 
arms: 

â¢  Arm A (experimental arm):  pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 

75 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days 

â¢  Arm B (control arm):  placebo plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 

days 

Patients in both treatment arms will receive up to 6 cycles of assigned study treatment 
and will also receive folic acid, vitamin B12 supplementation  and dexamethasone (refer 
to Section 5.2.4 through Section 5.2.6).  All patients will be followed until death or study 
closure.  However, a patient who is receiving benefit from treatment may receive 
additional cycles after discussion between the El  Lilly and Company (Lilly) physician 
and the investigator.  In this case, cycles will be repeated until the patient meets the 
criteria for study treatment discontinuation (Section 4.3). 

Patients will be evenly assigned (1:1 randomization) to the treatment arms based on the 
following randomization factors:  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (0 or 1 versus 2), previously treated for HNC (no versus yes), distant 
metastasis (no versus yes), prior platinum-based therapy (no versus yes), and country. 

The primary efficacy measure will be OS.  Secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR, and 
DoR; time to worsening (TTW) in dimensions of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
using FACT-H&N, change from baseline in dimensions of HRQoL using FACT-H&N, 
and safety.  The study is powered to detect a 25% improvement in OS when pemetrexed 
is combined with cisplatin by showing the median OS of 8 months with cisplatin plus 
placebo and 10 months with pemetrexed plus cisplatin. The 8-month survival estimate for 
cisplatin plus placebo is based on results from the Burtness trial (see Table JMHR.1). 

After approximately 632 deaths have been observed, the database for the final analysis 
will be validated and âlockedâ for the final analysis and preparation of the clinical study 
report. 

An interim analysis for futility is planned for this study. The interim analysis will be 
performed to assess safety and efficacy in order to determine whether it is scientifically 
and ethically appropriate to continue enrollment.  The futility analysis will be based on 
PFS as the OS data is not anticipated to mature at the time of interim analysis.  The 
interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 300 patients have experienced

analysis.  (See Section 8.2.11 regarding details about the interim analysis and about 
formation of the data monitoring board.)

Inclusion Criteria 

4.1. 
Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following 
criteria: 

[1]  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of squamous cell HNC, either: 

â¢ 

Recurrent disease (locally advanced or metastatic) that is not 
amenable to local therapy, (i) with at least 6 months since

â¢  Newly diagnosed distant metastatic disease (Stage IVc). 

[2]  Prior therapies: 

â¢  Radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks before study 
enrollment.  For palliative therapy, prior radiation therapy allowed

least 4 weeks before study enrollment.  Patients must have fully 
recovered from any acute effects of surgery prior to study 
enrollment.

involvement.) 
Renal:  calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) â¥ 45 mL/min.  (See 
Section 5.5.2.3 and Protocol Attachment JMHR.4 for acceptable 
methods of creatinine clearance assay.) 

â¢ 

[8]  Signed informed consent from patient. 

[9]  Patients at least 18 years of age. 

[10]  For women:  Must be surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or compliant 

with a medically approved contraceptive regimen (for example,

and for 6 months after the treatment period; must have a negative 
serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days before study enrollment, 
and must not be breast-feeding. 

For men:  Must be surgically sterile or compliant with a contraceptive 
regimen during and for 6 months after the treatment period. 

4.2.  Exclusion Criteria 
Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria: 

[11]  Prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy or biological anticancer 

therapy) for metastatic disease. 

[12]  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has 

not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study 
entry. 

[13]  Serious concomitant systemic disorder (for example active infection or 

cardiac disease) or psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the 
investigator, would compromise the patientâs ability to complete the 
study. 

[14]  Presence of clinically significant (by physical exam) third-space fluid 

collections, for example, ascites or pleural effusions that cannot be 
controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to study entry. 

[15]  Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of 

consideration for study enrollment. 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b) 
Confidential 

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 26 

[16]  Have had another primary malignancy other than HNC, unless that 

prior malignancy was treated at least 2 years previously with no 
evidence of recurrence.  Exception:  Patients with a history of in situ 
carcinoma of the cervix, nonmelanoma skin cancer, or low-grade 
(Gleason score â¤6) localized prostate cancer will be eligible even if 
diagnosed and treated less than 2 years previously.   

[17]  Nasopharyngeal, paranasal sinus, lip, or salivary gland cancer. 

[18]  Have central nervous system (CNS) metastases (unless the patient has 
completed successful local therapy for CNS metastases and has been 
off corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks before starting study therapy).  
Brain imaging is required in symptomatic patients to rule out brain 
metastases, but is not required in asymptomatic patients. 

[19]  Inability to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 

agents, other than an aspirin dose â¤1.3 grams per day, for a 5-day 
period (8-day period for long-acting agents, such as piroxicam). 

[20]  Unable or unwilling to take folic acid, vitamin B12, or prophylactic 

corticosteroids. 

[21]  Concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy. 

[22]  Pregnant or breast-feeding. 

4.2.1.  Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates 
Exclusion Criterion [12] uses the 30-day standard established by Lilly in order to clearly 
attribute events associated with an investigational agent with the appropriate 
investigational agent.  Exclusion Criteria [11], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], and [18] help to 
establish specificity of the patient population for both efficacy and safety analyses.  
Exclusion Criteria [19], [20], and [21] provide for patient safety.  Because preclinical 
data suggest that pemetrexed may have teratogenic effects, and safety has not been 
established for nursing infants, Exclusion Criterion [22] ensures patient safety.   

4.3.  Discontinuations 
The criteria for enrollment must be followed explicitly.  If a patient who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, that patient should be discontinued from the 
study treatment, and Lilly or its designee must be contacted.  An exception may be 
granted in rare circumstances where the patient has a serious or life-threatening condition 
for which there is no effective alternative therapy and, in the opinion of the investigator, 
is receiving benefit from study treatment.  In these rare cases, the investigator must obtain 
documented approval from Lilly to allow the patient to continue study treatment.  In 
addition, patients will be discontinued from study treatment in the following 
circumstances: 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b) 
Confidential 

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 27 

â¢  The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn from the 
study treatment.  If an SAE or a clinically significant laboratory value is 
the basis for this decision, the investigator will discontinue the study 
treatment, take appropriate measures, and immediately notify Lilly or its 
designee (see Safety, Section 6.3). 

â¢  The patient experiences any unacceptable adverse event that would require 

a third dose reduction. 

â¢  The patient or the attending physician requests that the patient be 

withdrawn from the study treatment. 

â¢  The patient cannot receive study treatment for 42 or more consecutive 

days from the first day of the previous cycle for any reason. 

â¢  The patient, for any reason, requires treatment with another therapeutic 
agent for this study indication.  In this case, discontinuation from study 
treatment occurs immediately upon introduction of the new agent. 

â¢  The investigator or Lilly, for any reason, stops the study or stops the 

patient's participation in the study. 

â¢  The patient has completed 6 cycles of study treatment. 
â¢  There is evidence of progressive disease (PD). 
â¢  The patient becomes pregnant or fails to use adequate birth control. 
â¢  The patient is noncompliant with study procedures. 

The date a patient discontinues study treatment will also be the first day of the patientâs 
30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up visit (refer to the Study Schedule in Protocol 
Attachment JMHR.1).

  Arm A (experimental arm):  pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 

75 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days 

  Arm B (control arm):  placebo (approximately 100 mL normal saline) 

plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days 

Table JMHR.2 (see Section 5.5) outlines the details of each treatment regimen, including 
supportive therapies. 

The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for explaining the correct use of the 
investigational agent(s) to the site personnel, verifying that instructions are followed 
properly, maintaining accurate records of study drug dispensing and collection, and 
returning all unused medication to Lilly at the end of the study. 

Patients will be instructed to contact the inves igator as soon as possible if he or she has a 
complaint or problem with the study drug so that the situation can be assessed. 

5.2.  Materials and Supplies 
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the countryâs regulatory requirements.   

5.2.1.  Pemetrexed (Treatment Arm A) 
The freeze-dried drug product contains pemetrexed disodium and mannitol in a 1:1 ratio.  
Sodium hydroxide  hydrochloric acid solution, or both, may be added during processing 
to adjust the pH.  The 500-mg vial contains pemetrexed disodium equivalent to 510 mg 
of the base compound, pemetrexed.  The vials contain a 2% excess to facilitate the 
withdrawal of the label amount from the vial.  The drug product is stable when stored at 
controlled room temperature. 

Reconstituting the 500-mg vial contents with 10 to 50 mL of sodium chloride injection 
gives a clear solution with a concentration of 10 to 50 mg/mL.  The reconstituted 
formulation is in the pH range of 6.8 to 7.5 and is chemically stable for 72 hours at 
refrigerated or room temperature.  However, the drug product contains no antimicrobial 
agent and should be administered within 24 hours after reconstitution in the original vial.  
Investigative site staff should discard unused portions.  Responsible individuals should 
inspect vial contents for particulate matter before and after they withdraw the drug 
product from a vial into a syringe. 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 29 

Investigative site personnel cannot administer the concentrated solution without further 
dilution.  For the purposes of clinical administration, site staff must dilute an appropriate 
quantity of the reconstituted contents of the vial into an infusion solution of 
approximately 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection.  After dilution, the shelf 
life of the product is 24 hours at room temperature.  Pemetrexed is not sensitive to light.  
Vials of pemetrexed contain no antimicrobial preservative, and they are single-use vials.  
Site staff must not store any unused portion of a vial for future use and they must discard 
unused portions of product. 

Pemetrexed is incompatible in solution with acidic medications or media, and site staff 
must not mix or administer simultaneously with other medications through the same 
infusion line.  Site personnel should flush the infusion line before administration of any 
concomitant medication.  Pemetrexed is compatible with standard polyvinyl chloride 
administration sets and intravenous solution bags. 

Site staff should inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration before administration whenever solution and container permit inspection. 

5.2.2.  Cisplatin (Both Treatment Arms) 
Cisplatin will be obtained locally.  A total dose of 75 mg/m2 of cisplatin will be diluted to 
a volume of 1000 mL with 0.9% sodium chloride prior to infusion.  The cisplatin solution 
should not be refrigerated.  Prior to and following the administration of cisplatin, the 
patient will be adequately hydrated according to local practice. 

5.2.3.  Placebo (Treatment Arm B)  
Placebo is normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride), and normal saline will also serve as the 
diluent for pemetrexed and cisplatin (Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2). 

Patients who are assigned to Treatment Arm B will receive approximately 100 mL 
normal saline in place of the pemetrexed infusion.  In order to protect the blinding of the 
study, the IV bags containing normal saline either with or without pemetrexed should be 
visually indistinguishable for Treatment Arms A and B.  (Refer to Section 5.6, Blinding.) 

5.2.4.  Folic Acid (Both Treatment Arms) 
Investigators will obtain folic acid as one of the following options, with preference in 
order from Option 1 to Option 3: 

1) 

2) 

3) 

350 to 600 Âµg folic acid 
a multivitamin containing folic acid in the range of 350 to 600 Âµg 
(acceptable only if Option 1 is not available) 
a dose of folic acid between 600 and 1000 Âµg (acceptable only if 
neither Option 1 nor Option 2 is available). 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 30 

For purposes of this study, all patients should take oral folic acid daily beginning 
approximately 1 to 2 weeks before treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin or cisplatin 
alone and continuing daily until 3 weeks after discontinuation from study therapy. 

5.2.5.  Vitamin B12 (Both Treatment Arms)  
Vitamin B12 will be prescribed by the investigator and administered as a 1000-Âµg 
intramuscular injection.  A vitamin B12 injection must be administered approximately 1 
to 2 weeks before treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin or cisplatin alone and should 
be repeated approximately every 9 weeks until 3 weeks after the last dose of study 
treatment. 

5.2.6.  Dexamethasone (Both Treatment Arms) 
Dexamethasone is one of a variety of corticosteroids available in tablet form ranging 
from 0.25 to 6 mg.  For purposes of this study, all patients will be given dexamethasone 
4 mg orally (or an equivalent corticosteroid and dose) twice per day on the day before, 
the day of, and the day after each dose of pemetrexed plus cisplatin or cisplatin alone. 

5.3.  Method of Assignment to Treatment 
A computerized, interactive, voice-activated response system (IVRS) at a central location 
will control random assignment for all study sites.  In order to preserve the blinding of 
the patient and the personnel involved in patient evaluations or data collection, an 
unblinded third party (for example, a pharmacist) will be designated.  The investigator 
should provide the necessary information to the unblinded pharmacist or designee who 
will call the IVRS to obtain the patientâs treatment assignment.  Neither the patient nor 
the investigator will know the treatment to which the patient has been assigned. 

The IVRS will assign patients to treatment arms according to the method of Pocock and 
Simon (1975).  Each patient will be assigned with probability 0.75 to the treatment arm 
that minimizes imbalances among the following equally weighted prognostic factors.  If 
the measures of imbalance are equal for both arms, then the probability of allocation to 
either arm will be 0.5.  Prognostic factors considered by the randomization algorithm are:

5.4.  Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study 

5.4.1.  Cisplatin 
In randomized clinical trials in advanced HNC patients, cisplatin is frequently dosed at 
75  mg/m2 every 3 weeks or 100 mg/m2 every 3 or 4 weeks, either as a single agent or as 
combination therapy (yielding a planned cisplatin dose intensity of 25 to 33 mg/m2/wk).  
In the Morton trial, in which a survival advantage was reported for cisplatin-based 
regimens over best supportive care, the planned cisplatin dose intensity was 25 
mg/m2/wk in both the cisplatin-only arm and the cisplatin-bleomycin arm (Morton et al. 
1985).  In the Clavel study, the planned dose intensity was 25 mg/m2/wk for cisplatin 
monotherapy, 33 mg/m2/wk for cisplatin plus 5-FU, and 16 mg/m2/wk for the cisplatin 
plus methotrexate plus bleomycin plus vincristine regimen; the Clavel study did not show 
a statistically significant difference in OS between arms (Clavel et al. 1994).  Together, 
cisplatin-based trials in advanced HNC patients suggest that efficacy does not vary 
substantially based on cisplatin dose intensity.  Veronesi and colleagues did not report 
significant differences in response rate, PFS, or OS in advanced HNC patients treated 
with either cisplatin 60 mg/m2 every 3 wks (20 mg/m2/wk) or cisplatin 120 mg/m2 every 
3 wks (40 mg/m2/wk), suggesting that cisplatin activity has limited drug-dose 
dependency in patients with advanced HNC (Veronesi et al. 1985).  Lastly, single-agent 
cisplatin 25 mg/m2/wk has shown similar efficacy to other cisplatin combination 
chemotherapies. 

Therefore, the proposed dosage for cisplatin in Study JMHR for both the comparator arm 
and the experimental arm is 75 mg/m2 administered intravenously every 3 weeks to yield 
a planned dose intensity of 25 mg/m2/wk. 

5.4.2.  Pemetrexed in Combination with Cisplatin 
As mentioned in Section 1.2.3.3.1, single-agent pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 without vitamin 
supplementation showed promising activity in locally advanced or metastatic HNC in 
Study JMAJ. 

In Study JMAP (see Section 1.2.3.2.2), a toxic death was reported in 1 HNC patient 
treated with pemetrexed 600 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 without vitamin 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 32 

supplementation.  The patient experienced multiple CTC Grade 3 and 4 toxicities during 
Cycle 1 of therapy:  stomatitis, dysphagia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and sepsis 
with pneumonia.  The patient died on Day 16.  Cause of death was not determined; an 
autopsy was performed. 

In Study JMCH (see Section 1.2.3.2.2), cisplatin 75 mg/m2 plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 
showed a manageable safety profile when administered with vitamin supplementation in 
the treatment of patients with MPM and led to its approval in the treatment of this cancer. 

Therefore, the proposed experimental treatment in Study JMHR is cisplatin 75 mg/m2 
plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with vitamin supplementation, both agents administered on 
Day 1 of a 3-week schedule. 

5.5.  Selection and Timing of Doses 
A delay of cycle as a result of holidays, weekends, bad weather, or other unforeseen 
circumstances will be permitted and not counted as a protocol violation. 

For patients on Treatment Arm A, the definition of a cycle is 1 dose of pemetrexed plus 1 
dose of cisplatin administered on Day 1 every 21 days. 

For patients on Treatment Arm B, the definition of a cycle is placebo (saline infusion) 
plus 1 dose of cisplatin administered on Day 1 every 21 days. 

The site will determine the actual doses of  he drugs to be administered to patients on 
both treatment arms by calculating the patientâs body surface area at the beginning of 
each cycle.  

Table JMHR.2 describes the dosage and the mode of administration for each study 
therapy.

Abbreviations:  im = intramuscular; iv = intravenous. 

5.5.1.  Special Treatment Considerations 
To maintain blinding of the study, patients in Treatment Arm B will receive 
approximately 100 mL normal saline in place of pemetrexed infusion.  The IV bags 
containing normal saline either with or without pemetrexed should be visually 
indistinguishable for Treatment Arms A and B (see Section 5.6, Blinding).  All patients 
will receive vitamin supplementation and prophylactic corticosteroids irrespective of 
treatment assignment. 

5.5.2.  Dose Adjustments or Delays for Subsequent Cycles 
Any patient who requires a dose reduction of pemetrexed or cisplatin will continue to 
receive the reduced dose for the remainder of the study.  Any patient who has 2 dose 
reductions and experiences an adverse event that would require a third dose reduction 
must be discontinued from study treatment. 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

Treatment may be delayed for up to 42 days to allow a patient sufficient time for 
recovery from a study-drug-related adverse event.  A patient who cannot be administered 
study drug for 42 days from the time of last treatment must be discontinued from study 
treatment. 

5.5.2.1.  Hematologic Adverse Events 
Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle of study treatment will be based on 
nadir (lowest value) platelet and absolute neutrophil counts from the preceding cycle.  
Prior to treatment, the ANC must be â¥1.5 Ã 109/L, and platelets must be â¥100 Ã 109/L.  
Treatment should be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery.  Upon recovery, 
treatment should be administered according to the guidelines in Table JMHR.3 below.

5.5.2.3.  Creatinine Clearance 
Creatinine clearance calculation will be based on the standard Cockcroft and Gault 
formula (1976) or on measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as assayed by a 24-hour 
urine sample or the appropriate radiolabeled method (51-CrEDTA or Tc99m-DTPA).  
The method of CrCl assessment that is used at baseline should be used throughout the 
study.  Enrollment and dosing decisions based on CrCl values may be made using either 
local lab values (calculated using the acceptable assay methods [Protocol Attachment 
JMHR.4]) or central laboratory values. 

If the local CrCl value is used for enrollment and dosing decisions for a patient, the 
serum creatinine must be assayed at the same local lab each time for that patient.  If a 
local lab is being used to monitor a patientâs renal function, the central laboratory sample 
still must be drawn for safety analysis. 

Prior to study treatment (at baseline), creatinine clearance should be â¥ 45 mL/min.  At 
subsequent cycles, if a patientâs CrCl value is <45 mL/min, the pemetrexed and cisplatin 
doses should be delayed to allow the patient to recover from toxicity.  Table JMHR.5 
provides the relevant dose adjustments of pemetrexed and cisplatin according to value of 
creatinine clearance. 

If the patientâs CrCl value has not returned to â¥ 45 mL/min within 42 days of the last 
doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin administration, the patient must be discontinued from 
study treatment unless continuation is approved by the Lilly clinical research physician 
(CRP).  Safety analysis will be based on the central laboratory serum creatinine and 
calculated CrCl values.

5.5.2.5.  Treatment Delays Due to Insufficient Folic Acid or Vitamin B12 

Supplementation 

The first dose of study drug should be delayed until the patient has taken folic acid for at 
least 5 of the 7 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1 and until the vitamin B12 injection has been 
administered.  Subsequent doses should be delayed until the patient has taken folic acid 
for at least 14 of the 21 days before Day 1 of the cycle. 

5.6.  Blinding 
Study JMHR is a randomized, double-blind study.  Treatment Arm A is defined as 
pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2, both administered intravenously on 
Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.  Treatment Arm B is defined as placebo plus cisplatin 
75 mg/m2, both administered intravenously on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.  In order to 
maintain blinding of the study, patients randomized to Treatment Arm B will receive 
approximately 100 mL of normal saline in place of pemetrexed infusion.  Infusion bags 
containing saline with or without pemetrexed should be visually indistinguishable for 
Treatment Arms A and B.  The unblinded pharmacist or designee at each site will prepare 
the study drugs. 

If, in the investigatorâs opinion, knowledge of treatment assignment would alter 
management of SAEs, the investigator or designee may be unblinded through the IVRS 
to obtain the patient treatment assignment.  This option may be used only if the patient's 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b) 
Confidential 

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 37 

well-being requires that medical staff have knowledge of the patientâs treatment 
assignment.  All calls resulting in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by the 
IVRS.  If the IVRS is inoperable, the investigator or designee must contact the unblinded 
pharmacist to obtain the patientâs treatment assignment. 

The investigator should make every effort to contact the Lilly CRP prior to unblinding a 
patient's treatment assignment.  If a patientâs treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly 
must be notified immediately by telephone.  The investigator or designee must document 
any unblinding event, and this documentation will include the patientâs number, the date, 
and the reason for unblinding. 

While every effort will be made to blind both the patient and the investigator to the 
identity of the treatment, the inadvertent unblinding of a patient may occur.  This 
unblinding will not be sufficient cause (in and of itself) for that patient to be discontinued 
from the study treatment or excluded from any safety or efficacy analysis. 

Efficacy information will not be shared between sites until the study is completed.  
Treatment assignment will be scrambled in the reporting database until database lock for 
data analysis.  This will ensure unblinded aggregate efficacy results are not available until 
the time of the data analysis.  There is a planned interim analysis for futility.  Only the 
Statistical Analysis Center (SAC) members and the independent Data Monitoring Board 
(DMB) will have access to unblinded data, as necessary (see Section 8.2.11 for details 
about the interim analysis). 

5.7.  Concomitant Therapy 
Patients are allowed to receive full supportive-care therapies during the study, including 
hormone-replacement therapy.  No other anticancer therapy, immunotherapy (for 
example, trastuzumab), hormonal cancer therapy, or experimental medications will be 
permitted while the patients are participating in this study.  However, localized 
radiotherapy is permitted for palliation of painful lesions at the investigatorâs discretion, 
provided the lesions do not represent PD.  Any PD requiring other forms of specific 
antitumor therapy will be cause for discontinuation of study therapy.  Section 5.7.1 
through Section 5.7.6 provide a discussion of the concomitant therapies that warrant 
special attention. 

5.7.1.  Colony Stimulating Factors 
Routine use of colony stimulating factor (CSF) is not permitted during this study.  The 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for use of CSF should be 
followed (Ozer et al. 2000).  Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be used 
for patients who have ANC <0.5 Ã 109/L, neutropenic fever, or documented infections 
while neutropenic.  Duration of uncomplicated neutropenia before initiation of G-CSF 
treatment is left to the investigatorâs discretion.  G-CSF must be discontinued at least 24

hours prior to the start of the next cycle of chemotherapy.  Use of erythropoietin is 
allowed. 

5.7.2.  Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs 
Patients should not take NSAIDs 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days after pemetrexed 
(or placebo) administration.  If a patient is taking an NSAID with a long half-life (for 
example, naproxen, piroxicam, diflunisal, or nabumetone), it should not be taken 5 days 
before, the day of, or 2 days after receiving pemetrexed (or placebo). 

Concurrent use of aspirin is allowed, up to a maximum dose of 1.3 grams per day. 

5.7.3.  Leucovorin 
Because folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation has reduced the number of episodes 
of CTCAE Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events associated with pemetrexed therapy, the 
sponsor does not anticipate the need for leucovorin as a rescue agent.  However, this 
section provides information on leucovorin rescue if clinically needed.  The protocol 
allows leucovorin rescue in any of the following circumstances: 
â¢  CTCAE Grade 4 leukopenia lasting longer than 3 days 
â¢  CTCAE Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 3 days 
â¢ 
â¢ 

immediately for CTCAE Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 

immediately for bleeding associated with CTCAE Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia 

â¢ 

immediately for CTCAE Grade 3 or CTCAE Grade 4 mucositis. 

The following doses and schedules are recommended for intravenous (iv) use: 

â¢ 
â¢ 

leucovorin, 100 mg/m2 iv once; followed by 

leucovorin, 50 mg/m2 iv every 6 hours for 8 days. 

The investigator also may use appropriate doses of the oral formulation at his or her 
discretion. 

5.7.4.  Therapy for Diarrhea 
In the event of diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed:  hydration, 
octreotide, and antidiarrheals. 

If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or 
severe (Grade 3 or 4) neutropenia, broad-spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed.  
Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting 
must be hospitalized for intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances.

5.7.5.  Therapy for Febrile Neutropenia 
Patients experiencing febrile neutropenia, especially with diarrhea or dyspnea, should be 
managed in a hospital setting according to standard procedures, with the urgent initiation 
of intravenous antibiotic therapy. 

5.7.6.  Clinically Significant Effusions 
If a patient develops clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions (on the basis of 
symptoms or clinical examination) prior to the first dose of study drug or during therapy, 
draining the effusion prior to dosing is required.  However, if the investigator determines 
that the effusion represents disease progression, the patient should be discontinued from 
study treatment. 

5.8.  Treatment Compliance 
Both pemetrexed and cisplatin will be intravenously administered only at the 
investigational sites by authorized study personnel.  Vitamin B12 supplementation will 
also be administered as an intramuscular injection at the investigational sites.  As a result, 
patient compliance is ensured.  In the period before the first dose of study therapy and 
during therapy, compliance with folic acid supplementation is required and should be 
documented by the investigative sites.  Section 5.5.2.5 provides definitions of sufficient 
folic acid and vitamin B12 therapy.

6.1.1.  Timing of Measurements 

6.1.1.1.  Baseline and Study Treatment Periods 
Within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment, baseline tumor measurement(s) will 
be performed on each patient.  Computed tomography (CT) scans (including spiral CT 
scans) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the preferred methods of 
measurement, but chest x-ray is acceptable if the lesion(s) is/are clearly defined and 
surrounded by aerated lung.  Ultrasound and PET scans will not be permitted as a method 
of lesion measurements.  Within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, 
physical examination will be performed for baseline measurement of palpable tumor 
lesions. 

The same method used at baseline must be used consistently for all tumor assessments 
and will be repeated every 6 weeks (Â± 2 weeks) except in the event of a response.  
Confirmation of response must occur at least 28 days from the first evidence of 
response.  Thereafter, a responding patient will be followed every other cycle per the 
Study Schedule (Protocol Attachment JMHR.1).  The sponsor will collect and store all 
tumor measurement images on all patients throughout the study. 

6.1.1.2.  Postdiscontinuation Period 
Patients in both treatment arms will continue treatment until they require discontinuation 
for one of the reasons cited in Section 4.3 of this document.  Each enrolled patient will 
have a follow-up period when the treatment period is completed. 

Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than objective disease 
progression will be followed at regular intervals for tumor measurement, by the same 
method used at baseline and during the study treatment period, every 6 weeks (Â±2 weeks) 
until objective disease progression.  For patients who are considered unconfirmed tumor 
responders and discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression, a 
confirmation of tumor response must be documented according to the RECIST guidelines 
(Protocol Attachment JMHR.5; Therasse et al. 2000).  Once the patient has disease 
progression, the patient will be followed every 90 days (Â±14 days).

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 41 

The date of first documented disease progression must be recorded on the case report 
form (CRF) even if it occurs after the patient has started a new therapy.  
Postdiscontinuation data to be collected will include:  the date of disease progression; 
documentation of any anticancer treatment patient has received including the dates of any 
postdiscontinuation systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or surgical intervention; and the date 
of death.  Patients will be followed until death or study closure (Section 8.2.12). 

6.1.2.  Efficacy Criteria for Tumor Response 
If this Phase 3 study is selected to support a new drug application, or if Lilly requires an 
independent review for any other reason, the response status of all patients may be 
reviewed by an independent panel of clinicians and may be reviewed by Lilly.  In case of 
a discrepancy between the assessment of the independent panel and that of the 
investigator, the independent panelâs assessment will take precedence.  Tumor responses 
will be measured and recorded by using the RECIST guidelines (Protocol Attachment 
JMHR.5; Therasse et al. 2000). 

6.1.2.1.  Best Response 
Best response is determined from the sequence of responses assessed.  For complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR), best response must be confirmed: a second 
assessment must be performed at least 28 days (and recommended within 42 days) after 
the first documentation of response.  Two objective status determinations of CR before 
progression are required for a best response of CR.  Two determinations of PR or better 
before progression, but not qualifying for a CR, are required for a best response of PR.  
Best response of stable disease (SD) is defined as disease that does not meet the criteria 
for CR, PR or PD and has been evaluated at least once and at least 6 weeks after baseline 
assessment. 

6.1.3.  Definition of Efficacy Measures 
Regarding the time-to-event measures defined below, study enrollment refers to the date 
of randomization. 

The following definitions for efficacy measures will apply: 

â¢  Overall survival (OS) duration is defined as the time from the date of 

randomization to the date of death from any cause.  For each patient who 
is not known to have died as of the data-inclusion cut-off date, OS 
duration will be censored at the date of the patientâs last contact prior to 
that cut-off date. 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b) 
Confidential 

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 42 

â¢  Objective progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 

the date of randomization to the date of objectively determined PD or 
death from any cause, whichever comes first.  For patients who are not 
known to have died as of the data-inclusion cut-off date, and who do not 
have PD, PFS will be censored at the date of the last objective 
progression-free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent 
systemic anticancer therapy.  

â¢  Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients 

whose best study response is CR or PR.  The response rate is calculated as 
the number of responders (best study response recorded as CR or PR) 
divided by the number of randomized patients. 

â¢  Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the first 

observation of CR or PR to the first observation of PD or death from any 
cause.  A response is defined as an objective status of CR or PR.  A 
responder is defined as any patient who exhibits a CR or PR.  For patients 
who are not known to have died as of the data-inclusion cut-off date and 
who do not have PD, DoR will be censored at the date of the last objective 
progression-free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent 
systemic anticancer therapy. 

6.2.  Health Outcome/Quality-of-Life Measures 
The multiple burdens of cancer and the effects of anticancer treatment can have a 
profound impact on patientsâ health-related quality of life (HRQoL).  The Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck Cancer (FACT-H&N) will be used in 
this study to assess and compare changes in HRQoL between the 2 treatment arms. 

The FACT H&N Version 4 is a reliable and valid instrument to assess HRQoL in patients 
with HNC (List et al. 1996; see Protocol Attachment JMHR.6).  The instrument consists 
of 39 items with 5-point rating scales where 0 equals ânot at allâ and 4 equals âvery 
much.â  It is organized into 5 sections where physical, social/family, and functional 
subscales include 7 items, emotional subscale includes 6 items, and H&N subscale 
includes 12 items. 

The FACT-H&N scores will be calculated based on scoring criteria proposed by the 
developer (Cella 2004).  Results of the FACT-H&N can be reported as the scores for 5 
individual subscales, a FACT-General total score (sum of physical, social/family, 
emotional, and functional well-being subscales), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) (sum of 
physical well-being, functional well-being, and FACT H&N subscales), and a Total 
FACT-H&N score (sum of FACT-General total score and FACT H&N score).  For all 
reports, a higher score represents a better quality of life. 

Both time to worsening (TTW) and changes from baseline in dimensions of HRQoL 
using FACT-H&N will be compared between treatment arms.  Minimally important 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b) 
Confidential 

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 43 

difference (MID) for change in scores will be used to determine meaningful differences 
in patientsâ FACT-H&N scores (Yost and Eton 2005). 

Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is considered to be a valuable summary measure of physical 
well-being, functional well-being, and disease-specific symptoms (Yost and Eton 2005).  
In patients with recurrent or metastatic HNC, the patientsâ well-being (including 
functional/physical abilities and disease-specific symptoms) will generally continue to 
worsen as disease progresses.  Time to worsening (TTW) in TOI is defined as a decrease 
in the TOI score that is considered at least a MID, as compared to the patientâs baseline 
score.  The upper range of MID points (based on the article by Yost and Eton) will be 
used as a guide to determine the meaningful decrease for individual patientâs score.  Time 
to worsening is measured from the date of randomization to the first date of a worsening 
in the TOI (as defined by a decrease from baseline in TOI that is at least the MID) or of 
death from any cause.  For patients who receive any subsequent systemic anticancer 
therapy prior to an observation of worsening, TTW will be censored at the date of the last 
worsening-free assessment prior to the subsequent systemic anticancer therapy.  For 
patients not known to have died or have an observation of worsening as of the data cut-
off date, TTW will be censored at the date of the last worsening-free assessment.  Time to 
worsening in other dimensions of FACT-H&N will be measured in a similar fashion. 

The lower range of MID (based on the article by Yost and Eton 2005) will be used for 
interpreting the group mean change and the upper limit will be used for interpreting the 
change in an individual patientâs score. 

Patients will complete the FACT-H&N prior to randomization, prior to infusion at every 
cycle of therapy (except Cycle 1), a  study-treatment discontinuation, and at 30-day 
postdiscontinuation follow up   Additionally, patients will complete the FACT-H&N 
every 6 weeks after the 30 day postdiscontinuation period until disease progression (refer 
to the Study Schedule in Protocol Attachment JMHR.1 for timing of assessments). 

During the treatment phase of the study, these assessments should be completed at the 
beginning of office visits, before any extensive contact and consultation with the 
clinician/study investigator.  Consultation with the clinician may bias perceptions about 
HRQoL and symptoms and thus affect assessments.  During the treatment period, patients 
will complete questionnaires prior to administration of subsequent cycles of study drug.  
If study drug administration is delayed, it is not necessary to repeat assessments. 

The FACT H&N will be completed by the patient.  Only patients with adequate literacy 
and for whom there is a validated translation in the language in which the patient is fluent 
will be asked to complete any self-administered questionnaires. 

Medical resource utilization data will be collected at each cycle and is largely derived 
from clinical data routinely collected through the CRFs.  These data include length of 
hospitalization, concomitant medications, and transfusions.  Medical resource utilization 
data will be analyzed for exploratory purposes.

6.3.  Safety Evaluations 
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients entered in this study 
and for alerting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if the event 
may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient. 

The investigator is responsible for appropriate medical care of patients during the study. 

The investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate healthcare 
option, adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before 
completing the study.  The patient should be followed until the event is resolved or 
explained.  Frequency of follow-up evaluation is left to the discretion of the investigator. 

6.3.1.  Adverse Events 

6.3.1.1.  Clinical Adverse Events 
Lilly has standards for reporting adverse events that are to be followed regardless of 
applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent   For purposes of collecting 
and evaluating all information about Lilly drugs or drug delivery systems used in clinical 
trials, a clinical trial adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product, without regard to the possibility of a causal 
relationship. 

Lack of drug effect is not an adverse event in clinical trials because the purpose of the 
clinical trial is to establish drug effect  

Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug or 
drug delivery system should be reported for tracking purposes.  Data on fetal outcome 
and breast-feeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation. 

Study site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each patientâs preexisting 
conditions. 

During the study, site personnel will record any change in the condition(s) and the 
occurrence and nature of any adverse events. 

If a patient never receives study drug, but experiences an adverse event after the 
informed consent document (ICD) is signed, ONLY events the investigator believes may 
have been caused by a protocol procedure will be reported to Lilly or its designee via the 
CRF. 

All adverse events occurring after enrollment must be reported to Lilly or its designee by 
CRF. 

Investigators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the 
potential relatedness of each adverse event to protocol procedure, studied disease state, 
study drug and/or drug delivery system via CRF. 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b) 
Confidential 

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 45 

In addition, study site personnel must report to Lilly or its designee immediately any 
SAEs or any instance where the investigator unblinds a patient's treatment group 
assignment for any other reason.  Remember that all adverse events must be reported by 
CRF, even if a telephone report has been made. 

If a patient's dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an adverse 
event, study site personnel must clearly report to Lilly or its designee via CRF the 
circumstances and data leading to any dosage reduction or discontinuation of treatment. 

Events leading to the clinical outcome of death from PD will be included as part of the 
safety and efficacy analyses for this study and will not be recorded as adverse events 
unless the investigator believes that the events may have been caused by the study drug. 

In cases where the investigator notices an unanticipated benefit to the patient, study site 
personnel should report âunexpected benefitâ with the actual event term to Lilly or its 
designee via CRF (for example, the complete actual term would be âunexpected 
benefitâsleeping longerâ). 

Thirty-day postdiscontinuation follow-up:  Each patient will have a 30-day 
postdiscontinuation follow-up evaluation.  This follow-up period is defined as a period of 
approximately 30 days commencing with the patient discontinuation from the treatment 
portion of the study, rather than with patientâs last dose of the study drug.  The start date 
of the first postdiscontinuation follow-up period should equal the date of patient 
discontinuation.  During this period, all ongoing or new adverse events, regardless of 
relatedness to study treatment or protocol procedure, must be evaluated and recorded on 
the CRF.  Any event deemed serious within the 30-day follow-up period, regardless of 
relatedness to study treatment or protocol procedure, must be reported immediately to 
Lilly or its designee and recorded on the CRF (refer to Section 6.3.1.3). 

Long-term follow-up:  After the 30-day postdiscontinuation follow-up, only adverse 
events thought to be related to study treatment or protocol procedures and deemed serious 
should be documented on the CRF.  Ongoing adverse events related to study treatment or 
protocol procedures will be followed until their remission or stabilization.  Serious 
adverse events determined to be related to study therapy also should be reported 
immediately to Lilly or its designee via the designated transmission method (refer to 
Section 6.3.1.3). 

6.3.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events 
Study site personnel must notify Lilly or its designee immediately, by the designated 
transmission method, any adverse event from the study that results in one of the 
following outcomes, or is significant for any other reason: 

â¢  death (excluding death due to progression of study disease) 
â¢ 
â¢  a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) 

initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 46 

â¢  persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
â¢  congenital anomaly/birth defect. 

Any SAEs occurring prior to enrollment that the investigator believes may have been 
caused by a protocol procedure must be reported immediately to Lilly or its designee and 
recorded on the case report form. 

Study-specific clinical outcomes of death from PD should be reported as an SAE only if 
the investigator deems them related to use of the study drug. 

6.3.1.3.  Postdiscontinuation Safety Follow-Up  
For all patients, a follow-up visit will occur approximately 30 days after discontinuation 
from study treatment.  Evaluation at the 30-day postdiscontinuation visit will include: 

â¢  chemistry and hematology assessments 
â¢  CTCAE ratings (if delayed adverse events related to study drugs are 

observed, the patient must be assessed approximately every 30 days until 
adverse events resolve or stabilize) 

â¢ 

report of postdiscontinuation adverse events, including the following: 

â  any adverse events, regardless of relatedness to study therapy, that 

occurred after discontinuation of study treatment 

â  outcome of any residual adverse events at the time of 

discontinuation of treatment 

â  documentation of date of death, if death has occurred 

â  key concomitant medications 

â  hospitalizations 

â 

transfusions. 

After the 30-day postdiscontinuation follow up, only SAEs thought to be related to study 
treatment or protocol procedures should be reported immediately to Lilly or its designee 
via the designated transmission method and recorded on the CRF.  For these events, the 
patient must be followed every 30 days (until the event has resolved, stabilized, or until 
the initiation of a new systemic anticancer therapy). 

6.3.2.  Laboratory Tests  
Please refer to Protocol Attachment JMHR.2 for the listing of laboratory tests to be 
performed for this study.  Refer to the Study Schedule (Protocol Attachment JMHR.1) for 
the timing of laboratory tests and clinical procedures.  Laboratory analysis results that 
would unblind the study will not be reported to investigational sites or other blinded 
personnel until the study has been unblinded.

6.3.2.1.  Limited Use Samples for Standard Laboratory Testing  
Blood samples will be collected at the times specified in the Study Schedule (Protocol 
Attachment JMHR.1).  Standard laboratory tests including chemistry and hematology 
panels will be performed.  A serum or urine pregnancy test (if applicable) will be 
performed at the investigative site or at a local laboratory.  Other clinical laboratory tests 
may be analyzed by a central laboratory.  Protocol Attachment JMHR.2 lists the specific 
tests that will be performed for the study. 

Samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed within 60 days of 
receipt of confirmed test results.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period of 
time, if necessary, to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or international laboratory 
certification standards. 

6.3.2.2.  Samples for Translational Research 
As part of Lillyâs ongoing efforts to understand the relationship between cancer, genetics, 
and response to therapy, this study will analyze biomarkers relevant to pemetrexed and 
cisplatin and to the disease state.  The study will also analyze the correlation between 
biomarkers and clinical outcome.  All sites are required to participate in this translational 
research, with the exception of sites where local regulations prohibit or limit this activity.  
Patient participation in this portion of the study is optional. 

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue will be collected from the tumor 
sample taken to make the initial histologic diagnosis of cancer or from the biopsy for 
recurrent disease based on availability.  The tissue will be used for research aimed at 
identifying markers for predicting clinical outcome to treatment with pemetrexed and 
cisplatin. 

Patients will not receive the translational research results at end of study.  Tissue samples 
may be collected for gene expression using microarrays and/or immunohistochemical 
(IHC) analyses, such as: 

â¢ 

â¢ 

â¢ 

thymidylate synthase (TS):  TS is a direct enzyme target of pemetrexed 
and plays an essential role in DNA synthesis.  Evidence suggests that high 
levels of TS may represent a resistance state to anti-folates 

folate receptor-alpha (FR-Î±):  FR-Î± is a membrane transporter of folates 
and may contribute to concentration of pemetrexed into the tumor cell 

folylpolyglutamyl synthetase (FPGS):  FPGS is an enzyme responsible for 
polyglutamation of pemetrexed.  This results in higher affinity binding of 
pemetrexed to both the folate-dependent enzymes TS and glycinamide 
ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT) 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 48 

â¢  excision-repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency 1 (ERCC1):  

ERCC1 is a DNA repair enzyme thought to play a role in sensitivity to 
platinum agents.  High ERCC1 levels may represent an ability for the 
tumor to repair cleavage induced by platinum agents and thus, a marker of 
resistance. 

The information from the expression profiles generated on a candidate gene level or by 
Affymetrix gene chips or equivalent, for example, may be used to correlate clinical 
outcome with potential changes in RNA/DNA levels.  Other markers of interest may be 
examined, based on evolving information at the time the laboratory assessments are done, 
given adequate material.  Taken collectively, these evaluations may assist in 
understanding the biology of head and neck cancer in this group of patients and their 
response to therapy. 

6.3.2.2.1.  Stored Samples 
Patients will have the option to participate in a portion of this study that involves storage 
of identifiable tissue samples (for example, trial patient numbers) for possible future 
research. 

Stored samples will retain the patient identifier and therefore will not be stored 
indefinitely.  Samples will be stored in the US for a maximum of 5 years after the last 
patient visit for the study; any sample remaining at that time will be destroyed. 

6.3.2.2.2.  Collection Procedures 
Samples will be shipped by the central laboratory to the designated research laboratories 
that are associated with Lilly and are located in the US. 

Tumor tissue samples should be prepared and shipped for analysis within 4 weeks of 
randomization. 

All samples will be labeled with the same identification code assigned to each patient in 
the clinical study.  This code will be used in lieu of the patientâs name to protect the 
patientâs identity. 

Samples must be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the lab requisition.  At 
baseline visit, before the patient receives study treatment, the following samples will be 
collected: 

â¢  pretreatment FFPE tumor tissue sample taken from the original diagnostic 

tumor specimen or from the biopsy at recurrent disease. 

6.3.3.  Other Safety Measures 
Other safety measures include physical examinations and adverse event ratings.  Patients 
will be rated for adverse events before each cycle using the CTCAE grade (Version 3.0, 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

NCI 2003).  See the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria 
(Version 3.0; NCI 2003), supplied with the CRFs. 

6.3.4.  Safety Monitoring 
The Lilly CRP will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study.  The Lilly 
CRP will review SAEs within time frames mandated by company procedures and will 
review trends, laboratory analyses, and adverse events at periodic intervals. 

For the purpose of the study, all deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed in a blinded 
fashion by Lilly during the clinical trial.  These reports will be reviewed to ensure 
completeness and accuracy but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the clinical trial.  If a 
death or SAEs occurs, only the Lilly Global Product Safety (GPS) associate will be 
nblended for regulatory reporting and safety monitoring purposes.  These measures will 
preserve the integrity of the data collected during the clinical trial and minimize any 
potential for bias while providing for appropriate safety monitoring. 

6.3.5.  Complaint Handling 
Lilly collects complaints on all study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical 
trials in order to ensure the safety of study par icipants, monitor quality, and make 
product improvements. 

The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the following aspects of 
the complaint process in accordance with the instructions provided for the study: 

recording a complete description of the product complaint reported 

â¢ 
â¢  completing a formal complaint report using the study specific complaint 

forms provided for this purpose 

â¢  determining when a drug/drug delivery system is to be returned. 

6.4.  Appropriateness of Measurements 
All efficacy and safety assessments used in this study are appropriate for a Phase 3 
oncology study.

7.  Data Quality Assurance 

To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will do the 
following: 

â¢  provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate 
â¢ 

sponsor a start-up training session to instruct the investigators and study 
coordinators.  This session will give instruction on the protocol, the 
completion of the CRFs, and study procedures 

â¢  make periodic visits to the study site 
â¢  be available for consultation and stay in contact with the study site 

personnel by mail, telephone, and/or fax 

â¢ 

review and evaluate CRF data and use standard computer edits to detect 
errors in data collection 

â¢  verify the quality of the data. 

In addition, Lilly or its representatives may periodically check a sample of the patient 
data recorded against source documents at the study site.  The study may be audited by 
Lilly Medical Quality Assurance (MQA) or its representatives, and/or regulatory 
agencies at any time.  Investigators will be given notice before an audit occurs. 

To ensure the safety of participants in the study and to ensure accurate, complete, and 
reliable data, the investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and 
patient medical records in the patient files as original source documents for the study.  If 
requested, the investigator will provide the sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and 
applicable ethical review boards with direct access to original source documents. 

7.1.  Data Entry and Computerized Systems 
The CRF data will be encoded and stored in a comprehensive computerized clinical 
research system intended for collecting, managing, and reviewing clinical study data. 

Central laboratory data will be stored electronically in the central laboratoryâs database 
system.  Data subsequently will be transferred from the contract laboratory to the Lilly 
generic laboratories system. 

Any data for which the CRF will serve as the source document will be identified and 
documented by each site in that siteâs study file. 

Data from complaint forms submitted to Lilly will be encoded and stored in the global 
complaint management system.

8.  Sample Size and Statistical Methods 

8.1.  Determination of Sample Size 
The study will enroll approximately 790 patients in 1:1 randomization (395 patients in 
Treatment Arm A and 395 patients in Treatment Arm B), and the sponsor will perform 
the final analysis after 632 deaths have occurred (that is, 20% censoring rate) to compare 
OS in patients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus patients treated with cisplatin 
alone.  Based on results from the Burtness trial (refer to Table JMHR.1), the median OS 
with single-agent cisplatin was estimated to be 8 months (Burtness et al. 2005).  This 
study is powered to detect a 25% improvement in OS when pemetrexed is combined with 
cisplatin by showing a median OS of 10 months with pemetrexed plus cisplatin.  
Assuming that the true survival hazard ratio (HR) of pemetrexed plus cisplatin to 
cisplatin alone is 0.80, the study has 80% power to achieve statistical significance at a 
two-sided level of 0.05. 
 
An interim analysis for futility is planned for this study.  The interim analysis will be 
performed to assess safety and efficacy in order to determine whether it is scientifically 
and ethically appropriate to continue enrollment   The futility analysis will be based on 
PFS as the OS data is not anticipated to mature at the time of interim analysis.  The 
interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 300 patients have experienced 
disease progression or have died.  All available data (from the randomized patients) prior 
to this cut-off date will be included in the interim analysis.  Patient enrollment will 
continue during the interim analysis (See Section 8.2.11 regarding details about the 
interim analysis).  Because the interim analysis is strictly for futility, the test for positive 
efficacy should not and will not be performed, and the trial can only be stopped due to 
lack of efficacy.  Thus, the type-I error for the final analysis of PFS will not be adjusted. 

8.2.  Statistical and Analytical Plans 

8.2.1.  General Considerations 
Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of the Eli Lilly and Company.  
The interpretation of study results will be the responsibility of the Lilly CRP and the 
statistician. The Lilly CRP and the statistician will also be responsible for the appropriate 
conduct of an internal review process for both the final study report and any study-related 
material to be authorized for publication. 

Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an 
amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Before any 
unblinding of the aggregate database, minor modifications or clarifications to the data 
analysis methods will be described and justified in the statistical analysis plan. Any 
retrospective or exploratory analyses not defined by the protocol or the statistical analysis 
plan will be explained in the clinical study report.

population). 

â¢  DoR:  All randomized patients with a confirmed best response of CR or 

PR. 

8.2.1.2.  Qualifications for Health Outcome/Quality-of-Life Analysis 
The following are qualifications for the analyses of health outcome analyses: 

â¢  All randomized patients with a baseline FACT-H&N assessment will be 

included in the analysis of TTW. 

â¢  All randomized patients with a baseline FACT-H&N assessment and at 
least 1 post-randomization assessment will be included in the analysis of 
change from baseline. 

8.2.1.3.  Qualifications for Safety Analysis 
All randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug (pemetrexed, cisplatin, 
or placebo) will be evaluated for safety. 

8.2.2.  Patient Disposition 
A detailed description of patient disposition will be provided.  It will include: 

â¢  A definition of patient qualification 
â¢  A summary of data on patient discontinuation 
â¢  A summary of data on overall qualification status of all patients 
â¢  An account of all identified protocol violations. 

All patients entered in the study will be accounted for in the summation.  The number of 
patients who do not qualify for analysis, who die, or who discontinue before treatment 
begins will be specified.  

8.2.3.  Patient Characteristics 
Patient characteristics will include a summary of the following: 

â¢  patient demographics

â¢  baseline disease characteristics 
â¢  pre-existing conditions 
â¢  prior therapies 
â¢  concomitant drugs. 

Other patient characteristics will be summarized as deemed appropriate. 

8.2.4.  Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant medications will be summarized for all randomized patients per treatment 
arm. 

8.2.5.  Treatment Compliance 
Only authorized study personnel at the investigative sites will administer pemetrexed and 
cisplatin.  Study personnel also will administer vitamin B12 as an intramuscular injection 
at the investigative sites.  As a result, the sites ensure patient compliance. 

Dose omissions, reductions, and delays will be summarized for all randomized patients 
per treatment arm. 

8.2.6.  Efficacy Analyses 

8.2.6.1.  Primary Outcome and Methodology 
The primary outcome measure for this trial is OS.  All randomized patients will be 
included in the analysis of OS.  The primary analysis will be the comparison of OS 
between the 2 study treatments using a stratified log-rank test at two-sided Î±=0.05 with 
the following prognostic variables as stratification factors:  performance status (0 or 1 
versus 2), previously treated for HNC (no versus yes), distant metastasis (no versus yes), 
and prior platinum-based therapy (no versus yes).  Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimation 
(Kaplan and Meier 1958) including generating K-M curve, quartiles, and interval 
estimation using 95% confidence intervals will also be done.  The supportive analysis of 
the primary outcome will be performed to obtain treatment effect after adjusting for the 
prognostic variables using Cox regression model (Cox 1972). 

8.2.6.2.  Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are objective PFS, ORR, and DoR. 

â¢  For each of the time-to-event endpoints (PFS and DoR), the following 

analyses will be performed:   

â  Kaplan-Meier estimation including generating K-M curve, 

quartiles, and interval estimation using 95% confidence intervals. 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

â  Stratified log-rank test stratified by the following prognostic 

variables: performance status (0 or 1 versus 2), previously treated 
for HNC (no versus yes), distant metastasis (no versus yes), and 
prior platinum-based therapy (no versus yes). 

â  Cox regression model to obtain treatment effect after adjusting for 

the prognostic variables. 

â¢  ORR will be compared between treatment arms based on an unadjusted, 

normal distribution approximation for the difference in rates.  A 95% 
confidence interval for the response rate of each arm will be calculated 
using an exact method. 

All randomized patients who were assigned to treatment will be included in the analysis 
of PFS and ORR.  The patient population for DoR is all randomized patients with a 
confirmed response. 

Overall response rate will be estimated by dividing the total number of confirmed CR or 
PR by the total number of patients randomized. 

Patients who discontinue before the study endpoint is reached without disease 
progression or death due to any cause will have their overall tumor response assessed per 
protocol and will be included in the analysis. 

8.2.7.  Quality-of-Life Analysis 
The HRQoL data, as measured by the FACT-H&N, will be collected.  There are 5 
subscale scores (physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, 
functional well-being, and H&N tumor subscales), a TOI score, a FACT-General total 
score, and a total FACT-H&N score. 

The time-to-worsening variables, including TTW in TOI, will be analyzed using the same 
methods mentioned for other time-to-event variables (see Section 8.2.6.2).  All 
randomized patients with a baseline assessment will be included in the TTW analyses. 

The change from baseline in subscale scores, TOI score, FACT-General total score, and 
Total FACT-H&N score will be analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measure analysis 
with treatment, baseline score, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and 
with patient nested in treatment as random effect in the model.  Within-subject 
correlation over time will be accounted for through compound symmetric covariance 
matrix.  The model will be fit using the restricted maximum likelihood method (REML).  
The significance of comparison between treatments for each visit will be based on the 
contrast of least square means (LSMeans).  The average of the LSMeans (over the 
number of visits) for each treatment group will also be compared and tested.  
Satterthwaiteâs approximation will be used to estimate degrees of freedom.  All 
randomized patients with baseline and at least 1 post-baseline measure will be included in 
the change from baseline analysis.

Internal consistency of baseline data for FACT-H&N subscales will be tested using 
Cronbachâs alpha method.  Medical resource utilization data will be summarized by each 
treatment arm for all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 

8.2.8.  Statistical Strategy for Analyzing Selected Efficacy 

Endpoints 

To establish PFS, ORR, and FACT-H&N functional efficacy in the study while 
controlling for type I error, a gatekeeping strategy will be applied in analyzing these 
endpoints.  The endpoints will be analyzed with a two-sided 0.05 level of significance 
with the following chronological order: 

1.  PFS 

2.  ORR 

3.  TTW in TOI from FACT-H&N instrument 

8.2.9.  Safety Analyses 
The safety evaluation will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study 
therapy, including saline placebo.  Safety analyses will include summaries of the 
following: 

â¢  maximum CTCAE grades for laboratory and nonlaboratory adverse 

events. 

treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 

â¢ 
â¢  adverse events causing discontinuation from the study 
â¢  SAEs causing discontinuation from the study 
â¢  hospitalizations 
â¢  blood transfusions. 

The incidences of selected adverse events from the two treatment arms will be compared 
using Fisherâs Exact test. 

8.2.10. Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses on OS and objective PFS will be conducted on important subgroups 
of patients.  These subgroups are ECOG performance status (0 or 1 versus 2), previously 
treated for HNC (no versus yes), distant metastasis (no versus yes), prior platinum-based 
therapy (no versus yes), age (<50 versus â¥50), sex (male versus female), race (Caucasian 
versus Non-Caucasian), and prior surgery or radiotherapy within 6 months of 
randomization (no versus yes). 

Additional subgroup analyses will be performed as deemed appropriate.

8.2.11. Interim Analyses 
There is one interim analysis planned for this study.  The interim analysis will be 
performed to assess safety and efficacy in order to determine whether it is scientifically 
and ethically appropriate to continue enrollment. The OS data is anticipated to be 
preliminary (with high censoring) at the time of interim analysis, and it is assumed that 
PFS is a reasonable surrogate for OS.  Therefore, the question of whether there is 
evidence of a lack of efficacy for pemetrexed plus cisplatin (relative to placebo plus 
cisplatin) will be evaluated based on an interim analysis of PFS (one of the secondary 
endpoints of the study).  The interim analysis will calculate conditional power after 
approximately 300 patients have had disease progression or have died.  It is anticipated 
that the interim analysis will be conducted after approximately 400 patients have been 
enrolled into the trial.  The data inclusion cut-off date for this analysis will be fixed when 
approximately 300 PFS events have been observed.  All available data (from randomized 
patients) prior to this cut-off date will be included in the interim analysis. 

The trial enrollment may be stopped following this interim analysis, but only if the 
experimental arm shows evidence of unacceptable toxicity or a lack of efficacy for 
pemetrexed plus cisplatin over placebo plus cisplatin. 

 
This futility analysis based on PFS can be described as follows: 

The natural logarithm of the PFS hazard ratio (for pemetrexed plus cisplatin over placebo 
plus cisplatin) will be estimated using the Cox model with 5 covariates (assigned 
treatment arm, ECOG performance status, previously treated for HNC, distant metastasis, 
and prior platinum based therapy)  

Conditional on this interim estimate for the PFS HR, assuming the true PFS HR is 0.78, 
and assuming the number of PFS events at the final analysis will be 700 (88.6% of 790), 
the conditional statistical power of the final analysis of PFS will be calculated (Crowley 
and Ankert 2006).  If this conditional power is strictly less than 0.741, then the DMB 
should recommend that study enrollment be stopped.  Attachment JMHR.7 provides the 
formula used to calculate conditional statistical power. 

Assuming exactly 300 PFS events are included in this interim analysis, the operating 
characteristics for this futility test are shown in Table JMHR.7.

Since the stopping rules are based on some assumptions, the threshold values (the interim 
HR and the conditional power) should be viewed only as a guidance, not the absolute 
rule, for interim decision making.  Analyses of safety data at interim will be performed as 
described in Section 8.2.9.  At the interim analysis, the DMB may also recommend that 
trial enrollment be stopped if the experimental arm shows evidence of unacceptable 
toxicity. 
 
The overall survival or any other efficacy data will not be analyzed and will not be 
reported at the interim analysis. 
 
During the interim analysis, patient accrual will continue.  A Data Monitoring Board 
(DMB) will be formed in accordance with Lilly policies and procedures and will be 
responsible for evaluating interim results.  Interim analysis will be conducted according 
to the DMB charter.  A number of individuals outside the DMB will form the Statistical 
Analysis Center (SAC), a group that will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of 
interim data and preparing interim summaries and analyses for the DMB.  The SAC 
members will have access to interim data as needed to validate data and facilitate the 
DMBâs review.  The SAC members will be limited to a minimal number of individuals 
needed for this role.  The DMB and SAC members will be external to Lilly.  The SAC 
members will not be allowed to disseminate any information pertaining to interim data 
other than to members of the SAC or the DMB.  Only the DMB is authorized to review 
completely unblinded interim analyses.  Study sites will receive information about 
interim results ONLY if they need to know for the safety of their patients. 

8.2.12. Criteria for End of Study 
The study will end when data collection is stopped.  The study design is to enroll 790 
patients and perform a final analysis after approximately 632 deaths have been observed, 
at which time database lock will occur.  Lilly has the right to stop collecting data after the 
database has been locked; however, after the final analysis, data may continue to be 
collected on surviving patients.  If further data are collected that are not included as part 
of the final locked database, the postlock data will eventually be combined with the 
locked database and stored in a data library separate from the locked database.  The 
clinical study report will not be revised to reflect these additional data. 

8.2.13. Translational Research Analyses 
The distributions of biomarkers with continuous measures, such as gene or protein 
expression, will be described for total patient population and by treatment arms.  
Summary statistics will include means, medians, corresponding standard errors, quartiles, 
and ranges.  Biomarkers with discrete measures, such as genotype locus or IHC-staining-
assessed protein expression, will be summarized in frequency tables for total population 
and by treatment arm.

A Cox regression analysis of time-to-event variables such as OS and PFS will be 
performed with each gene measured fit as a single covariate, using the following 
additional baseline covariates:  assigned study treatment arm (pemetrexed plus cisplatin 
versus placebo plus cisplatin), performance status (0 or 1 versus 2), previously treated for 
HNC (no versus yes), distant metastasis (no versus yes), and prior platinum-based 
therapy (no versus yes).  The covariates in the model correspond to the study 
randomization factors.  The Cox regression analysis of OS and PFS, will be repeated with 
gene expression level data, along with interaction with treatment in the analytical model.  
In addition, a Cox multiple regression analysis with those genes identified as significant 
will be performed to look for interactions between multiple genes.  Logistic regressions 
of best tumor response on gene expression will be done for each gene, using methods 
analogous to those described above for the Cox regression analyses.  The protein 
expression data will be analyzed in similar manner as gene expression.

a  See Section 5.5 for exceptions to timing of doses.  Patients will continue cycles of therapy until disease 

progression or until the patient meets criteria for study treatment discontinuation. 

b  Postdiscontinuation visit is approximately 30 days after patient discontinuation from the treatment 

portion of the study, rather than after the last dose of the study drug. 

  Following 30-day postdiscontinuation visit and objective disease progression, patients will be followed 

every 90 days (Â±14 days).  Data collected will include:  date of disease progression; any anticancer 
treatment including the dates of any postdiscontinuation systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or surgical 
intervention; and the date of death.  The date of first documented disease progression must be recorded 
on the CRF even if it occurs after the patient has started a new therapy.  Patients will be followed until 
death or study closure. 

c  Before the infusion. 
d  Physical examination will include measurements of height (at baseline only) and weight. 
e  Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 

days prior to study enrollment. 

f  Record key concomitant medications or growth factors (including G-CSF, GM-CSF, erythropoietin, 

antibiotics, and any nonstudy vitamin supplementation) and information related to transfusions at every 
cycle including the 30-day postdiscontinuation visit. 

g  Visual measurements (for palpable lesions) must be performed using a metric ruler or calipers, and a 

color medical photograph must be taken   For radiologic tests, CT (including spiral CT) scans and MRI 
are the preferred methods of measurement, but chest x-ray is acceptable if the lesion(s) is/are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung   Investigators must consistently use the same imaging 
modality. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Baseline (palpable le ions):  Within 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. 
Baseline (radiological):  Within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. 
During study treatment:  Before the infusion.  Palpable lesion measurements and radiological 
assessments should be completed approximately every 6 weeks (Â±2 weeks) within 7 days of every 
other cycle of treatment; for example, after baseline, assessments should 
be repeated within 7 days prior to, or the day of, Day 1 of Cycle 3, Cycle 5, etc. 
Response confirmation:  Responses must be confirmed.  Confirmation should be performed 
â¥ 28 days after initial response documentation and then every 6 weeks (Â±2 weeks). 
Postdiscontinuation follow-up period:  Every 6 weeks (Â±2 weeks) until objective disease 
progression based on lesion measurements.  Thereafter, repeated as clinically indicated.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
h  Chemistry and Hematology: 

Baseline:  â¤ 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1. 
Cycle 1, Day 15:  All patients will have blood collected during Cycle 1, on Day 15 Â±3 days 
During study treatment:  â¤ 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle.   
Additional chemistry and hematology values may be collected during study treatment cycles 
per local practice guidelines.  Investigators must document their review of each laboratory report. 
Postdiscontinuation visit:  ~ 30 days after patient discontinuation from the treatment portion of 

the study, rather than after the last dose of the study drug.

Creatinine Clearance Assay Methods 

Creatinine clearance calculation in this study will be based on any the following assay 
methods: 

1)  The standard Cockcroft and Gault formula (1976) 

Note:  This formula is to be used for calculating CrCl from local lab results only.  
Central laboratory applies the formula and reports the value in its calculated form.   

 

 
 
CrCl (mL/min)  = 

 
 
 
CrCl (mL/min) = 

For serum creatinine concentration in mg/dL: 
  (140 â age+) Ã (wt+)  Ã  (0.85 for women*) 

72 Ã serum creatinine (mg/dL) 

 
For serum creatinine concentration in Âµmol/L: 
   (140 â age+) Ã (wt+)  Ã  (0.85 for women*) 

0.81 Ã serum creatinine (Âµmol/L) 

Abbreviation: CrCl = creatinine clearance. 
+age in years, weight (wt) in kilograms. 
*factor is 1.0 for men. 
Cockcroft and Gault 1976. 
 

2)  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured by a 24-hour urine 

sample. 

3)  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured by the appropriate 

radiolabeled method (51-CrEDTA or Tc99m-DTPA).

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines 

Protocol Attachment JMHR.5 

(Therasse et al. 2000) 

Measurability of Tumor Lesions at Baseline: 

Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
as â¥ 20 mm with conventional techniques or as  â¥ 10mm with spiral CT scan (longest 
diameter to be recorded).  

Nonmeasurable lesions -  all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 
mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly 
nonmeasurable lesions.  Lesions considered to be truly nonmeasurable include the 
following:  bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not 
confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions. 

Documentation of âtargetâ and ânontargetâ lesions at Baseline: 

All tumor measurements will be recorded in centimeters using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the start of treatment but 
never more than 28 days before beginning treatment. 

Target - All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).  If the measurable disease is 
restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
cytology/histology. 

A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum longest diameter.  The baseline sum longest diameter will be used as the 
reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response. 

Nontarget â All other lesions (or sites of disease) including small lesions (longest 
diameter <20 mm with conventional CT scan, <10 mm with spiral CT scan) and other 
non-measurable lesions should be identified as nontarget lesions and should be recorded 
at baseline.  Measurement of these lesions are not required, but the presence of absence 
of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 

Method of Measurement 

The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Computerized 
tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), should be performed with cuts 
of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 
5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  This applies to the chest, abdomen, and 

Pemetrexed H3E-MC-JMHR(b)

Protocol Amendment 

Redacted Version Page 75 

pelvis.  Chest X-ray is acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT scan or MRI is preferred.    

Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial  (for 
example, skin nodules or palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
recommended. 

Timing of Subsequent Tumor Assessments 

Radiological and physical assessments will be routinely repeated before drug 
administration at every other cycle throughout the treatment period and at follow-up 
visits (as specified in the Schedule of Events, Protocol Attachment JMHR.1).  All areas 
of disease must be re-evaluated at each subsequent assessment.  The same technique used 
at baseline must be used.  Chest x-rays are acceptable for a subsequent assessment if used 
at baseline, however CT scan or MRI is preferred.  

If the patientâs disease has responded to therapy, the investigator must confirm the 
response.  It is recommended that confirmation of response occur â¥28 days and â¤42 days 
after the first evidence of response using the same radiological technique as at baseline.  
The baseline sum of longest diameters of target lesions will be used as reference for 
confirmation of response. 

Both measurable and nonmeasurable lesions should be evaluated at each restaging to 
determine whether they have completely resolved or persisted, or whether new lesions 
have appeared. 

Response Criteria: 

Patients will be assessed using the following criteria: 

â¢  Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all tumor lesions. 
â¢  Partial response (PR): Either a) at least a 30% decrease in the sum of 

the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the 
baseline sum LDs or b) complete disappearance of target lesions, with 
persistence (but not worsening) of one or more nontarget lesions.  In 
either case, no new lesions may have appeared.  

â¢  Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 

sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest 
sum LD. 

â¢  Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD 
of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded 
since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new 
lesions.

Formula for Conditional Power 

 

Let I be the number of PFS events at the interim analysis, F the number of PFS events at 
the final analysis, and ZI the value of the standard normal interim test statistic under H0.  
Then for testing H0 (conditional on ZI with true HR = y): 

Power  =  1 â Î¦[(ZÎ±/2 + ZI (I/F)1/2 â (1âI/F)(0.5)(F)1/2 log(1/y)) / (1âI/F)1/2]. 
 

ZÎ±/2  is the upper 100th(1-Î±/2) percentile of the standard normal distribution; y is 
the true PFS hazard ratio of Pemetrexed plus Cisplatin relative to Placebo plus 
Cisplatin; where Î¦ is the standard normal distribution function.
