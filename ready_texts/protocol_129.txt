STUDY DESIGN 
 

and 

tirapazamine 

Phase  III  randomized  trial  of  concomitant  radiation, 
cisplatin, 
versus 
concomitant  radiation  and  cisplatin  in  patients  with 
advanced head and neck cancer 
 
Multicenter 

(SR259075) 

The  trial  will  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
concomitant 
tirapazamine, 
cisplatin, and radiation versus cisplatin and radiation. 

chemoradiation  with 

The primary endpoint is overall survival. 
The  secondary  endpoint  is  failure-free  survival  (FFS). 
Failure-free  survival  is  the  number  of  months  from 
randomization  until  the  earliest  of  locoregional  failure, 
development of distant metastasis, or death. 
Other tertiary endpoints include, but are not limited to, 
the following: 
•  Time 
to 

failure  with  date  of 

locoregional 

randomization as the start date. 

•  Patterns of failure as the initial site of failure at the 
primary site, neck, distant sites or combinations of 
these. 

•  Cumulative incidence of unacceptable locoregional 
treatment  outcome  as  a  function  of  time.    An 
unacceptable  outcome 
is  defined  as  either 
locoregional failure or severe late treatment-related 
toxicity which may be any of the following: grade 4 
skin,  subcutaneous  tissue,  mucous  membrane  or 
bone  toxicity,  grade  3  or  4  spinal  cord  toxicity, 
grade  4  laryngeal  toxicity  requiring  tracheostomy, 
or the need for enteral feeding persisting beyond 12 
months following completion of treatment.   

•  Change  in  QoL  from  baseline  as  assessed  by 
FACT-H&N  scale  in  eligible  patients  at  6  months 
post-treatment (see 6.1.2.7 QoL Evaluation).  

•  Toxicity  and  safety,  determined  through  review  of 
adverse  events,  routine  symptom  assessment,  and 
laboratory determinations.  

•  Initial response rates defined as rates of CR, PR, SD 
or  PD 
completion  of 
chemoradiation  therapy  as  described  in  Section 
6.1.2.5.  

eight  weeks 

after 

•  Final CR rate as defined in Section 6.1.2.5 (d).  
Additional analysis will include correlation of efficacy 
with  baseline  hypoxia  measurements.    Measurements 
of  hypoxia  will  include  blood  levels  of  chemical 
markers.

Formulation(s): 

 
 

 
 

Route(s) of administration: 

Dose regimen: 

 

Subjects  with  previously  untreated  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, 
or larynx, Stage III or Stage IV (excluding T1N1, T2N1 
and metastatic disease).  Subjects must have ambulatory 
ECOG  performance  status  ≤2  and  adequate  renal, 
hepatic, and hematologic function. 
 
850 evaluable subjects 
 
Between 50 and 90. 

 
 

100, 200, or 250 mL of Tirapazamine will  be supplied 
in  100,  200  or  300  mL  bottles,  respectively,  as  a  clear 
yellow-orange liquid (0.7 mg/mL) in an isotonic citrate 
buffer with a pH between 3.7 and 4.3. 
 
Tirapazamine and cisplatin: Intravenous (IV) 
Antiemetics: Oral (PO) and/or intravenous (IV) 
Antidiarrheals: Oral (PO) 
 
Radiotherapy:  All  patients  will  receive  conventionally 
fractionated radiation therapy with the macroscopic sites 
of disease treated to 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks.  
Techniques  using  conformal  techniques  to  deliver  the 
radiation  can  be  used.    Centers  not  using  conformal 
techniques have a one-time option of changing to such 
techniques. 
 
Cisplatin (Arm 1) 
Cisplatin  (100  mg/m2,  1-hour  infusion)  immediately 
before radiation therapy on Day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 7 
of radiotherapy. 
 
Tirapazamine and cisplatin (Arm 2) 
Tirapazamine (290 mg/m2, two-hour infusion), followed 
after 1 hour by cisplatin (75 mg/m2, 1-hour infusion) 
immediately before radiation therapy on Day 1 of weeks 
1, 4, and 7 of radiotherapy. 
 
Tirapazamine  (160  mg/m2,  two-hour  infusion)  on  days 
1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2 and 3 of radiotherapy.

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE 
 
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

 
The primary endpoint is overall survival. 
 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoint:  failure-free  survival. 
Other tertiary endpoints are time to locoregional failure, 
patterns of failure, cumulative incidence of unacceptable 
outcome, Quality of Life (QoL), and response rate. 
 
Safety  will  be  determined  through  review  of  adverse 
events,  routine  symptom  assessment,  and  laboratory 
determinations. 
 
 
See Flow Chart 

 
The sample size of 425 per treatment arm will provide 
at least 90% power under the following assumptions:

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
(continued) 

The  cutoff  date  for  the  final  analysis  of  survival  is 
planned  to  be  the  date  of  the  334th  death.  The  final 
survival  cutoff  is  expected  to  occur  approximately  2 
years after the end of accrual. 
For FFS the final analysis will have a cutoff equal to the 
date  of  the  245th  failure.  The  final  FFS  analysis  is 
expected to take place approximately 1 month after the 
last patient is accrued.  
 
Three  interim  analyses  for  survival  are  planned.  The 
first one is calendar-based and will have a cutoff of 15 
September  2004.  The  second  interim  analysis  will  be 
done with the same cutoff as the final FFS analysis, i.e. 
the  date  of  the  245th  FFS  event.  The  third  interim 
analysis will be done with a cutoff equal to the date of 
the 282nd death. Under trial assumptions the date of the 
282nd death is expected to be approximately 1 year after 
the  end  of  accrual.  Type  I  error  of  the  overall  survival 
analyses  will  be  controlled  using  the  O'Brien-Fleming 
spending function. 

v 

hypopharynx/oral 

Treatment  assignment  will  be  done  by  centrally 
stratifying  for  disease  stage  (III  v  IV),  primary  site 
(oropharynx/larynx 
cavity), 
hemoglobin  (≥13.5  g/dL  for  men  and  ≥12.5  g/dL  for 
women  vs  otherwise).    A  dynamic  allocation  method 
will  be  used  to  avoid  extreme  imbalance  of  treatment 
assignment within a single institution.   
 
Cox proportional hazards model with prognostic factors 
of  ECOG  performance  status  (0  vs  1,2),  disease  stage 
(III  vs  IV),  primary  site  (oral  cavity/hypopharynx  vs 
oropharynx/larynx),  and  hemoglobin  (≥13.5  g/dL  for 
men  and  ≥12.5  g/dL  for  women  vs  otherwise)  will  be 
used  to  compare  the  treatment  groups  for  the  time-
related  endpoints,  overall  survival,  failure-free  survival 
and time to locoregional failure. Categorical parameters, 
such  as  response  rate,  will  be  evaluated  using  the  chi-
squared test. 
Characteristics  of  subjects  assigned  to  the  2  treatment 
arms will be summarized.  These include sex, race, age, 
weight,  height,  performance  status,  histology,  stage  of 
disease,  measurable  disease,  time  since  diagnosis, 
presence  of  other  disease  conditions,  and  clinical 
laboratory tests. 
The incidence of adverse events will be summarized by 
type of event and toxicity grade.

DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD 
(per subject) 
 

The  duration  of  study  for  an  individual  patient  will 
include a period for inclusion and treatment planning of 
up to 1 month, a 7 week treatment period followed by a 
minimum  of  4  weeks  of  follow-up  for  chemotherapy 
related toxicities after the last dose of study drug(s).  All 
subjects  will  be  followed  for  disease  status  until 
locoregional  disease  progression,  death,  or  the  study 
cutoff date, whichever comes first.  All subjects will be 
followed  for  QoL  until  three  years  after  completion  of 
therapy  or  study  cut-off  date.    All  subjects  will  be 
followed  for  survival,  radiation  toxicity  and  further 
therapy until death or the study cutoff date.  The study 
cutoff date is defined as the date of the 334th death.

1.  INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Natural history of head and neck cancer 

Head and neck cancer occurs with an annual incidence of approximately 40,000 cases in 
the  United  States  (1).    Generally,  about  30%  of  these  patients  will  present  with  locally 
confined (T1 or T2, Stage I or Stage II) lesions.  The majority of patients will present with 
locoregionally advanced disease (T3, T4, N1-N3, Stage III or IV).  Metastatic spread to 
distant organs at the time of diagnosis is seen clinically in few patients.  Autopsy series, 
however,  have  indicated  a  higher  incidence  of  approximately  50%  of  patients  with 
micrometastatic spread (2)(3). Due to the firm association of this disease with tobacco and 
alcohol use, patients with head and neck cancer usually suffer from a variety of additional 
diseases  related  to  these  risk  factors,  e.g.,  advanced  arteriosclerosis,  obstructive  lung 
disease and hepatic disease (4).  Most importantly, they are at risk for second synchronous 
or  metachronous  malignancies  in  the  head  and  neck  region  as  well  as  other  organs, 
predominantly the lung and esophagus (5). 
 
1.2 Locoregionally advanced disease 

For patients with locoregionally advanced disease (Stage III or IV), surgery and radiation 
have  traditionally  been  used  in  sequence.    Despite  this  aggressive  bimodality  treatment 
approach,  cure  is  achieved  in  only  a  minority  of  patients  (6).    Most  patients  die  of 
locoregional  persistence  or  recurrence  of  disease.    The  addition  of  chemotherapy  to  the 
overall  treatment  plan  has  been  studied  intensively  over  the  last  3 decades.    Research 
strategies,  generally,  have  included  the  use  of  induction  (neoadjuvant)  or  adjuvant 
chemotherapy,  as  well  as  concomitant  chemoradiotherapy.    The  primary  goal  of  such 
research  is  to  improve  local  control  and  survival.    Given  the  anatomic  location  of  the 
disease and the frequently aggressive surgical approaches used, the use of less extensive 
surgery  (and  the  preservation  of  organ  function)  is  an  important  second  treatment  goal.  
Recently  reported  randomized  trials  conducted  to  study  the  role  of  chemotherapy  have 
yielded  the  consistent  finding  that  concurrent  administration  of  chemotherapy  (platinum 
+/- 5-FU)  and radiotherapy results in improved locoregional control and overall survival 
compared to radiotherapy alone (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12). Conversely, sequential (usually 
neoadjuvant)  chemotherapy  has  yielded  only  a  marginal  non-significant  benefit  .    As  of 
2002,  it  is  now  widely  accepted  that  combinations  of  cisplatin  with  radiation  are  the 
standard of care for those patients with locally advanced disease in whom surgery cannot 
be  performed  or  for  those  patients  who  do  not  wish  the  radical  surgery  that  is  required 
(13). 
 
1.3 Hypoxia and head and neck cancer 

Radiation kills dividing cells through the creation of double stranded DNA breaks.  This 
process  is  dependent  on  the  presence  of  oxygen,  which  “fixes”  free-radical-induced 
lesions produced by ionizing radiation. 
 

18/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

Hypoxia in tumors limits the potential of radiation therapy to kill tumor cells (14).  This 
has been found to happen not only in animal models but it also has been found to have an 
important clinical effect.  This has been best demonstrated in head and neck cancer where 
the disease is accessible to direct measurement of intratumor oxygen tension (15) (16) (17) 
(18).  The presence of hypoxia was found to be a strong prognostic factor in predicting the 
outcome of patients with advanced head and neck cancer after radiation therapy. 
 
1.4  Rationale for tirapazamine in advanced head and neck cancer 

Tirapazamine  is  a  bioreductively  activated,  hypoxia-selective  antitumor  agent  of  the 
benzotriazine series.  It is 35 to 450 times more cytotoxic (dependent on tumor cell line 
studied) to hypoxic cells than to well-oxygenated cells (19) (20) (21) (22).  Tirapazamine 
is bioactivated to a cytotoxic metabolite by electron transfer.  This one-electron reduction 
product,  which  is  an  oxidizing  radical  anion,  causes  extensive  single-  and  double-strand 
breaks  in  DNA.    It  may  also  accentuate  DNA  damage  induced  by  radiation  or 
DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents by inhibiting DNA repair (23). 
 
Tirapazamine also results in a marked potentiation of cisplatin cytotoxicity (24).  This may 
be  the  primary  cause  of  anti-tumor  efficacy,  since  in  a  number  of  models,  the  level  of 
cytotoxicity of tirapazamine alone is quite low while the combination of tirapazamine and 
cisplatin increases the level of cell kill by many orders of magnitude. 
 
The  scientific  rationale  for  and  function  of  tirapazamine  in  oncology  is  supported  by 
previous  human  experience,  particularly  in  non-small  cell  lung  cancer.    This  experience 
may be summarized as follows: 
 
• 

In  solid  tumors,  the  combination  of  cisplatin  and  tirapazamine  is  efficacious 
compared to cisplatin alone.  [Phase II  (25) (26) and Phase III (CATAPULT I) (27) 
trials] 

In man, tirapazamine can be added to radiation regimens safely, and tirapazamine 
is  likely  to  contribute  to  the  therapy  of  those  tumors,  where  hypoxia  has  long  been 
known  to  limit  the  effectiveness  of  radiation.    [DRI2938  (28),  EFC3344,  EFC3714 
(29)] 

 
The selection of tirapazamine for development in the treatment of head and neck cancer is 
based on the observation that: 
 
• 

It is a disease, which is known to be significantly hypoxic, and where hypoxia is 
known  to  be  a  marker  for  poor  prognosis  after  radiation  therapy  (15)  (16)  (17)  (18) 
(23). 

• 

• 

• 

 

It is a disease where both cisplatin and radiation therapy have an important role in 
therapy, but where these active agents still do not cure a majority of selected patients.  
Furthermore, no second chemotherapy agent has a clearly established role. 

It is a disease where local control has an important benefit for patients because of 

the functional and cosmetic importance of the anatomical area.

1.4.1 Tirapazamine related toxicities 

Based  on  the  patients  treated  with  tirapazamine  plus  cisplatin  in  2  large  randomized 
Phase III trials in lung cancer, 5 toxicities have been observed where the tirapazamine arm 
had significantly more events than the control arm (See the CIB  for more details): 
• 

Muscle cramps: Muscle cramps tend to occur early in the course of therapy.  They 
are  associated  with  the  administration  of  treatment  (median  =1  day  from  prior 
infusion), and are typically of brief duration (median =2 days).  Only 45% of patients 
experiencing  muscle  cramps  during  the  first  cycle  experienced  a  recurrence  on 
subsequent  cycles.    There  was  no  tendency  toward  progressive  worsening  of  muscle 
cramps upon repeat exposure.  Muscle cramps is not a dose related toxicity. 

• 

• 

• 

Hearing loss: Two distinct patterns of hearing loss (early onset and late onset) were 
observed in EFC2753, with some evidence to support distinct underlying pathogenesis.  
In the tirapazamine plus cisplatin treatment arm, the time to first occurrence of hearing 
loss  was  acute  and  most  often  occurred  in  the  first  few  days  of  Cycle 1.    This  early 
onset hearing loss (reported within 5 days or less after 1st infusion) was acute (median 
occurrence =1 day from 1st infusion) and of short duration (median=1 day).  For some 
tirapazamine-treated  subjects  with  early  onset  hearing  loss,  unscheduled  audiograms 
were  performed  early  in  the  first  treatment  cycle.    Analyses  of  these  audiograms 
revealed a distinct pattern of decreased hearing threshold across all frequencies, which 
typically  reversed  at  the  subsequent  examination  (end  of  Cycle 2,  per  protocol).  
Hearing  loss  is  a  dose  related  toxicity  and the  frequency  of  this  event  is  lower  using 
doses lower than 390 mg /m2  as was used in the randomized trials.  In addition, late 
onset  hearing  loss  (occurring  more  than  5 days  after  1st  infusion)  was  also  identified.  
The  co-administration  of  tirapazamine  did  not  appear  to  enhance  the  frequency  or 
severity of late onset-hearing loss that is associated with cisplatin. 

Abnormal  vision:  Visual  adverse  events    were  of  interest  during  the  conduct  of 
EFC2753 because preclinical toxicology findings had identified eye lesions in the dog 
as a potential toxicity of tirapazamine.  Because of these findings, visual adverse events 
were  of  particular  interest  in  this  study.    A  more  frequent  incidence  of  varied  visual 
adverse  events  [blurred  vision,  decreased  visual  acuity,  visual  disturbance,  etc.]  were 
reported in the tirapazamine plus cisplatin treatment arm [50 (23%) of 219 subjects in 
the  tirapazamine  plus  cisplatin  treatment  arm  reported  this  event  vs.    21 (10%)  of 
219 subjects  in  the  cisplatin  monotherapy  treatment  arm].    No  evidence  of  late  onset 
cumulative toxicity of this event was observed.  Specific visual tests (visual acuity and 
color  discrimination)  were  performed  at  6-week  intervals  during  the  study  to  further 
characterize vision changes.  The incidence of objective abnormalities in visual acuity 
and color discrimination was low overall, the same in both treatment arms, and did not 
appear to be related to clinical adverse events.  No evidence of visual toxicity of the 
severity or frequency observed in the dog was seen in human subjects.   

Nausea/vomiting:  Both  nausea  and  vomiting  were  significantly  more  frequent  in 
the  tirapazamine  arm  of  EFC2753  (86%  and  82%  compared  to  69%  and  46% 
respectively in the cisplatin  monotherapy  arm).    No  evidence  of  clinically  significant 
late-onset  cumulative  toxicity  was  apparent  in  either  treatment  arm.    Nausea  and 
vomiting induced by tirapazamine, especially when given in combination with cisplatin 
or other emetogenic agents, should be managed prophylactically with 5HT  antagonists.

Diarrhea:  Diarrhea  was  typically  of  abrupt  onset  (median  <1  day  from  prior 
infusion),  and  brief  in  duration  (median  <1  day),  irrespective  of  grade  and  cycle  of 
onset.    High-grade  episodes  were  reported  in  the  context  of  associated  incontinence, 
presumably related to the abrupt onset.  Patients could be re-treated without necessarily 
experiencing a recurrence of diarrhea or worsening in severity. 

 
1.5 Clinical experience with tirapazamine for head and neck cancer 

1.5.1 Radiotherapy and single-agent tirapazamine 

A  Phase  II  trial  was  done  to  determine  the  tolerability  of  radiation  therapy  and 
concomitant tirapazamine in head and neck cancer (30).  Thirty-nine patients with Stage 
III or IV head and neck cancer were treated with conventional RT  (70 Gy  in 7 weeks) 
and  concurrent  tirapazamine  (159  mg/m2  intravenously  3  times  per  week  for  12  doses).  
32/39  (83%)  received  full  12 drug  doses  and  32/39  received  full  radiation.    The  most 
frequent drug toxicities were muscle cramps and nausea/vomiting.  Thirteen patients had 
Grade 3  or  Grade 4  drug  related  toxicities.    No  excessive  RT-associated  acute  normal 
tissue reactions were noted.  With a median follow-up of 13 months, the 1-year and 2-year 
local  control  rate  (primary  site  only)  was  64%  and  59%  respectively.    The  authors 
concluded  that  the  tirapazamine  regimen  was  well  tolerated,  the  toxicity  with  RT  was 
acceptable, and the disease control was encouraging. 
 
1.5.2 Radiotherapy, cisplatin, and tirapazamine for head and neck cancer 

1.5.2.1 The Peter MacCallum Phase I Trial 

The maximally tolerated dose of tirapazamine when combined with cisplatin and radiation 
in patients with T3-4 and/or N2-3 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck has been 
investigated by Rischin et al (31). 
 
The  starting  schedule  was  conventionally  fractionated  radiotherapy  (70  Gy  in  7 weeks), 
with  concomitant  cisplatin  75  mg/m2  and  tirapazamine  290 mg/m2  (prior  to  cisplatin)  in 
weeks  1,  4,  and  7,  and  tirapazamine  alone  160  mg/m2  3  times  a  week  in  Weeks 2, 3, 5, 
and 6.    PET    scans  for  tumor  hypoxia  (18F misonidazole)  were  performed  prior  to  and 
during radiotherapy.  This regimen is schematically shown in Figure (1.5.2.1) 1 .

Figure (1.5.2.1) 1 - RISCHIN/PETERS Concomittant chemotherapy radiotherapy regimen 
 
 
Sixteen  patients  with  predominantly  oropharyngeal  primaries,  including  10 patients  with 
T4  or  N3  disease  were  treated.    Febrile  neutropenia  occurred  towards  the  end  of 
radiotherapy  in  3  out  of  6 patients  treated  on  the  initial  dose  level.    Another  10 patients 
were  treated  with  the  same  doses,  but  weeks  5  and  6  tirapazamine  doses  were  omitted.  
This resulted in less neutropenia, only 1 dose-limiting toxicity (febrile neutropenia), and 
8 out of 10 patients completed treatment without any dose omissions.  The acute radiation 
toxicities  were  not  obviously  enhanced  compared  to  chemoradiotherapy  regimens  using 
concurrent  platinum  and  5-fluorouracil.    Muscle  cramps  were  troublesome  in  some 
patients  during  the  first  2  weeks  of  treatment.    However,  the  cramps  had  generally 
subsided  and  largely  resolved  by  the  third  week  of  treatment,  without  any  alteration  to 
chemotherapy doses and irrespective of the treatment given for the cramps.  Transient skin 
rashes  due  to  tirapazamine  were  seen  in  4  patients.    18F  misonidazole  scans  detected 
hypoxia in 14/15 patients at baseline with only 1 patient having detectable hypoxia at the 
end of treatment.  With a median follow-up of 2.2 years, the 2 year failure-free survival 
rate is 69% (SE = 12%), the 2 year local progression-free rate is 88% (SE = 8%), and the 
2 year overall survival rate is 75% (SE = 11%). 
 
The authors concluded that dose-limiting toxicity was febrile neutropenia, which could be 
overcome  by  omitting  tirapazamine  in  weeks  5  and  6.    The  triple  combination  of 
tirapazamine, cisplatin, and radiotherapy resulted in remarkably good and durable clinical 
responses in patients with very advanced head and neck cancers.   
 
1.5.2.2 The Stanford Experience 

A second randomized Phase II trial comparing a cis/5FU/Radiation regimen to that of the 
same regimen with TPZ added is in progress directed at organ preservation at Stanford and 
the  toxicities  have  been  reported  in  an  abstract  (32).    Tirapazamine  300-330  mg/m2 
day (d) 1,  22,  cisplatin  100  mg/m2  d1,  22  and  fluorouracil  1000  mg/m2/d  by  continuous 
infusion d1-5 & d22-26 are given initially, followed by the simultaneous administration of 
radiotherapy  and  tirapazamine  160-260  mg/m2  d43,  45,  47,  71,  73,  75,  and  cisplatin 
20 mg/m2 d43, 45, 47, 71, 73, 75, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2/day by 96 hour continuous 
infusion  d43-46  &  d71-74.    At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis,  23 patients  have  been 

22/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

randomized  to  treatment  with  tirapazamine  and  20 were  evaluable  for  toxicity.  
Granulocytopenia  was  the  most  frequent  toxicity  during  the  induction  chemotherapy.  
Grade  3  or  4  granulocytopenia  occurred  in  8/16  patients  treated  at  300  mg/m2  and  4/4 
treated  at  390  mg/m2.    During  simultaneous  chemoradiation,  1/4,  3/12,  and  2/4  patients 
treated with 160mg/m2, 220 mg/m2, and 290 mg/m2 developed Grade 3 granulocytopenia.  
The  most  common  toxicity  during  simultaneous  chemoradiation  was  mucositis,  which 
reached Grade 3 in 9/20 and Grade 4 in 2/20.  Skin reactions, weight loss, fatigue, muscle 
cramps and tinnitus, and other of mild toxicity were also seen.  The authors concluded that 
the overall toxicity is comparable to the same regimen without tirapazamine. 
 
1.5.2.3 The TROG Randomized Phase II Trial 

Following  the  interesting  results  of  the  Phase  I  trial,  the  TROG  initiated  a  randomized 
Phase  II  trial  that  was  designed  to  select  the  experimental  arm  for  their  next  Phase  III 
study.   
 
The  2  arms  were  the  CDDP/TPZ/XRT        regimen  developed  in  the  Phase  I  trial  and  a 
“chemoboost”  regimen  slightly  modified  from  a  protocol  developed  by  Peters  and 
colleagues at the University of Texas` MD Anderson Cancer Center (33).  The modified 
regimen  differed  from  the  MD  Anderson  protocol  by  administration  of  cisplatin  as  a 
weekly  bolus  rather  than  a  continuous  infusion  and  reduction  of  the  5FU  dose  from 
400mg/m2 to 360 mg/m2 because of hematological toxicity.  The “chemoboost” regimen 
was piloted at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute in 28 patients with locally advanced 
head and neck cancer including 14 patients with T4 and/or N3 disease (34).  The overall 
complete response rate was 71% (95% CI:  51%-67%).  With a median potential follow-
up time of 29 months, the 2 year failure-free survival rate was estimated to be 40% (CI:  
21%-59%) and the 2 year overall survival rate was estimated to be 50% (CI:  29%-71%).  
The  initial  site  of  relapse  or  progression  was  locoregional  in  11  of  the  16  patients  who 
failed.   
 
The  TROG  randomized  Phase  II  study  has  currently  accrued  over  100  of  a  target  of 
120 patients at 11 centers in Australia and New Zealand.  An interim safety analysis was 
performed  on  the  first  63 patients  (35).    On  the  tirapazamine  arm,  Grade  3  neutropenia 
occurred in 30% and Grade 4 neutropenia in 3% of patients.  Twelve percent of patients 
on  this  arm  experienced  an  episode  of  febrile  neutropenia.    Thrombocytopenia  of  any 
grade was uncommon in both arms, but 2 patients on the tirapazamine arm had grade 4 
thrombocytopenia.  There was no statistically significant difference in mucositis between 
the 2 arms, but the radiation skin reaction was of longer duration in the “chemoboost" arm.  
While the toxicities were significant, including hematological toxicities and some of the 
known toxicities of tirapazamine, TROG has concluded that the regimen can be used in a 
multicenter trial.   
 
1.6 Rationale for study 

The approach of using concurrent radiation, tirapazamine, and cisplatin appears promising 
from the initial Phase I/II trials.  This randomized Phase III trial will be a pivotal trial to 

23/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

compare  this  regimen  with  a  standard  regimen  that  is  currently  used  for  head  and  neck 
cancer. 
 
1.6.1 Selection of a control arm 

Most  investigators  today  agree  that  a  platin  (cisplatin  or  carboplatin)  is  the  most  active 
agent  to  add  to  radiation.    However,  no  single  platin-based  regimen  combined  with 
radiation therapy has emerged as an overall standard of care.  Several recent randomized 
trials, either in progress or planned, use 3 doses of cisplatin, 100 mg/m2 in weeks 1, 4, and 
7 of standard radiation therapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks).  These include the 
recently reported Intergroup Phase III trial for laryngeal cancer RTOG  91-11 (11) , the 
Intergroup trial for unresectable head and neck cancer (12) and the planned RTOG Phase 
III trial (KK Ang personal communication) where this regimen will be the control arm. 
 
1.6.2 Selection of endpoints 

The study is powered for the primary endpoint of overall survival. Failure-free survival is 
the  secondary  endpoint.  Other  tertiary  endpoints  include  time  to  locoregional  failure, 
response rate, patterns of failure, cumulative incidence of unacceptable outcome, Quality 
of Life (QoL), toxicity and safety.  
 
1.6.2.1 Overall survival/ failure-free survival 

The goal of therapy in this protocol is to cure the patient.  As such, overall survival is the 
primary  endpoint.    With  advanced  head  and  neck  cancer,  uncontrolled  locoregional 
disease  is  the  most  common  cause  of  death  and  it  is  therefore  expected  that  improved 
locoregional control should be associated with improved overall survival.  However, it is 
apparent  that  the  survival  gain  to  be  expected  from  any  realized  improvement  in 
locoregional  control  is  quantitatively  less  because  of  deaths  from  distant  metastatic 
disease, second cancers and intercurrent non-malignant medical conditions to which this 
patient population is prone. 
 
The  secondary  endpoint  of  failure-free  survival  (FFS)  is  the  number  of  months  from 
randomization until the earliest of locoregional failure, development of distant metastasis, 
or death. Since the FFS endpoint classifies patients with progressive or recurrent disease 
as failures, it would be expected to be more sensitive than overall survival in detecting a 
beneficial effect of the test regimen. 
 
1.6.2.2 Locoregional failure 

Squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  head  and  neck  is  a  disease  that  if  locally  uncontrolled 
causes  considerable  morbidity  and  mortality.    This  is  because  the  natural  history  of  the 
disease is usually of local progression and regional spread in advance of life-threatening 
distant  metastasis.    A  relatively  small  percentage  of  patients  with  head  and  neck  cancer 
will  manifest  distant  metastases.    This  is  particularly  true  for  head  and  neck  cancer 
patients with early stage nodal disease.  The vast majority of treatment failures involve a 
component of loco-regional  disease recurrence.  Depending on the exact site of disease, 

24/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

locally  uncontrolled  disease  is  associated  with  debilitating  problems  in  eating,  breathing 
and speaking, pain, malodor, and in the case of advanced neck disease, tumor fungation.  
Death usually results from inanition, aspiration pneumonia, or torrential hemorrhage.   
 
Patients with locally uncontrolled head and neck cancer frequently become social outcasts 
and  in  need  of  high  level  palliative  care.    Because  uncontrolled  disease  exacts  such  a 
heavy  price,  the  general  consensus  within  the  head  and  neck  community  is  that 
loco-regional control is the single most important determinant of patient well-being.  This 
is  intuitively  obvious  and  has, therefore,  not  been  the  subject  of  formal  QoL    studies  in 
head  and  neck  cancer.    One  study,  however,  on  40 patients  without  and  8  patients  with 
recurrent disease, reported, not surprisingly, that patients with recurrence scored badly in 
all domains (36). 
 
An  important  concern  with  locoregional  failure  as  an  endpoint  for  clinical  trials  is  the 
potential  subjectivity  of  the  endpoint,  which  can  cause  bias,  and  irreproducibility  of  the 
results.    However,  for  head  and  neck  cancer,  recurrence  of  disease  is  generally  not 
clinically  silent  to  careful  examination  or  symptoms.    The  areas  at  risk  for  locoregional 
failure  are  amenable  to  examination  by  direct  inspection,  fiberoptic  endoscopy  and 
palpation of accessible primary sites and the neck.  For this study, these examinations will 
be done every 2 months the first year, every 3 months the second year and every 4 months 
the third year or until study cut-off.  If there is a suspicion of recurrence, CT /MRI will be 
done as well as biopsy.  Scheduled CT or MRIs will complement the clinical exams every 
4  months  for  the  first  year  and  then  every  6  months  until  the  cut-off  date.    Using  this 
rigorous  follow-up,  bias  of  the  observer  can  be  minimized.    Furthermore,  when  there  is 
recurrence  of  disease,  it  is  usually  rapidly  progressive,  and  inter-observer  differences 
would not significantly alter time to locoregional failure. 
 
1.6.2.3 Quality of life evaluation 

Quality of life (QoL) is an important outcome of this phase III trial. It is possible that the 
primary hypothesis of improved overall survival may not be demonstrated with statistical 
significance.  Such an outcome could reasonably occur due to dilution of a true treatment 
effect by high rates of intercurrent illness and non-cancer deaths.  In this event, improved 
locoregional control in the experimental arm combined with improved QoL may constitute 
sufficient evidence of benefit for the experimental treatment to be adopted as standard.  In 
contrast, durably inferior QoL results in the experimental arm would necessitate a careful 
examination  of  the  risks  and  benefits  before  adopting  the  experimental  arm  as  standard 
treatment, even if a survival benefit of small magnitude is shown. 
 
1.6.2.3.1  Quality-of-life hypotheses 

It  is  expected  that  baseline  QoL  scores  will  decline  during  treatment  and  recover 
approximately  to  baseline  by  6  months  following  completion  of  treatment  in  patients 
achieving  a  complete  response  .    Thereafter,  the  average  QoL  in  both  arms  will  decline 
over  time  as  more  patients  relapse  and  develop  new  symptoms.    As  pain  is  a  dominant 
symptom  of  recurrent  head  and  neck  cancer,  pain  scores  would  be  expected  to  be 

25/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

particularly  sensitive  to  post-treatment  relapse.    The  hypothesis  to  be  tested  is:  the 
difference between baseline scores and the current QoL and pain scores, measured after 
the acute treatment toxicities have resolved, will be more positive in the experimental arm.  
This is consistent with the importance of the other endpoints of survival and locoregional 
failure, which are not acute endpoints.   
 

2.  STUDY OBJECTIVES

3.  STUDY DESIGN 

3.1 Description of the protocol 

This  is  a  Phase  III,  multicenter,  international,  randomized  open-label,  2-arm  trial 
comparing  2 chemotherapy  regimens:  cisplatin  (control  arm)  versus  cisplatin  and 
tirapazamine (experimental), each used with concomitant radiation in advanced head and 
neck cancer.  A two-stage sequential design will be used.   
 
3.2 Interim analysis 

Three interim analyses for survival are planned. The first one is calendar-based and will 
have a cutoff of 15 September 2004. The second interim analysis will be done with the 
same cutoff as the final FFS analysis, i.e. the date of the 245th FFS event. The third interim 
analysis  will  be  done  with  a  cutoff  equal  to  the  date  of  the  282nd  death.  Under  trial 
assumptions 
to  be  approximately  
1  year  after  the  end  of  accrual.  Type  I  error  will  be  controlled  by  the  O’Brien-Fleming 
alpha spending function.

26/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

 
The planned interim analyses will be performed by the trial statistician and submitted to 
the  Independent  Data  Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (IDSMC).  The  IDSMC  will 
determine  if  prespecified  statistical  boundaries  are  crossed  and  whether  the  results  are 
sufficiently conclusive to recommend stopping accrual or early publication. The IDSMC 
will  make  any  recommendations  to  the  Trial  Management  Committee.  The  Trial 
Management  Committee  and  the  Sponsor  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  any  decisions 
concerning early stopping or publication. 
 
If  at  the  time  of  interim  analysis  there  is  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  overall 
survival in either direction (using an α level as defined in Section 10.7.1.2), study accrual 
may be stopped, assuming the target sample size has not been reached.  Patients already 
entered will be followed up for completion of clinical/survival data for a certain period to 
be determined by the Trial Management Committee.  If the interim survival analysis is not 
significant,  patients  will  continue  to  be  accrued  and  followed  till  the  study  cut-off  date 
defined in the protocol. 
 
3.3 Study committees 

A  Trial  Management  Committee  (TMC)  including  members  of  the  Trans-Tasman 
Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) will supervise the conduct of the trial.  Responsibility 
for the trial will be jointly held by the TMC and the sponsor, Sanofi-Synthelabo Research.  
There will be at least eight seats on the committee, the majority of whom shall be clinical 
investigators.    TROG    membership  will  include  the  principal  investigators  and  the 
statistician.    Sponsor  representative  will  be  limited  to  three  members  including  a 
statistician.  The TMC will choose additional representatives from participating clinicians. 
 
An Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (IDSMC) will meet periodically 
to  review  the  safety  of  the  trial.    The  broad  responsibility  of  the  IDSMC  will  be  to 
independently  monitor  the  conduct  of  the  trial.    Specifically  it  will  monitor  the  trial’s 
scientific integrity, ensure patient safety and monitor adverse effects. 
 
3.4 Duration of study participation 

The duration of the study participation will include for each patient a one month inclusion 
and  treatment  planning  period,  followed  by  a  7  week  treatment  period,  followed  by  a 
minimum of 4 weeks of follow-up for chemotherapy related toxicities after the completion 
of the study treatment.  In addition, all patients will be followed for radiation toxicity until 
death or study cut-off.  All subjects will be followed for disease status until locoregional 
progression, death, or the study cut-off date whichever comes first.  All subjects will be 
followed for QoL until three years after completion of therapy or study cut-off date.  All 
subjects will be followed for survival and further therapy until death or the study cut-off 
date.   
 
The study cut-off date is defined as the date of the 334th death, which is expected to occur 
approximately  2  years  after  the  enrollment  of  the  last  patient.  The  estimated  time  for 

27/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

accrual is 2.5 years, giving an estimated total duration of the trial of 4.5 years. Additional 
follow-up may be recommended by the trial management committee to answer significant 
clinical questions related to the objectives.

5.  TREATMENT 

5.1 Radiotherapy 

In both treatment arms radiotherapy will consist of a conventionally fractionated radical 
course  of  treatment.    The  dose  to  sites  of  macroscopic  disease  identified  clinically  or 
radiologically will be 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks except for small volume nodal 
disease (under 2 cm maximum diameter on CT) where 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks 
is sufficient.  This is important in the lower neck to minimize the risk of brachial plexus 
injury.    Sites  of  potential  subclinical  involvement  will  receive  50  Gy  in  5  weeks  or  its 
biologic equivalent.  Lymphatic pathways to be treated electively must include a minimum 
of two echelons of uninvolved nodes eg a patient with T3NO oropharyngeal cancer would 
require  treatment  of  the  upper  and  mid  cervical  nodes  but  not  necessarily  the 
supraclavicular  nodes.    Patients  with  ipsilateral  N2  or  N3  disease  must  have  the  entire 
opposite  neck  treated  electively.    Specifics  of  radiotherapy  technique  and  reporting 
requirements are described below. 
 
Treatment  may  be  planned  using  either  standard  (parallel-opposed)  or  3D  conformal 
techniques.    IMRT  is  not  allowed  on  this  study.    An  approved  benchmark  for  either 
standard or 3D planning must be on file at the Quality Assurance Review Center (QARC).  
The benchmark material is available on the QARC  website (www.QARC.org).  Centers 
wishing  to  use  only  standard  planning  must  complete  the  standard  planning  benchmark.  
Centers that have completed the 3D benchmark may use either planning method. If a site 
wishes to upgrade from standard planning to conformal planning, a 3D benchmark must 
be completed and approved by QARC. 
To avoid bias, randomization will be done only after the decision has been made to treat 
the  patient  by  a  standard  or  conformal  technique  and  radiation  therapy  planning  for  the 
first  phase  of  treatment  has  been  completed.  With  standard  treatment  (parallel  opposed 
fields), planning for the first 40 Gy must be completed prior to randomization. Planning of 

29/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

off-cord and boost volumes may be deferred to allow for the fact that patient weight loss 
and/or  regression  of  large  neck  nodal  masses  may  decrease  the  lateral  separation  of  the 
fields. With conformal treatment, planning for the first 50 Gy should be completed in its 
entirety prior to randomization.  
 
Only linear accelerator based treatments (photon energy 4 MV  or greater or electrons) are 
allowed on this study.  Co-60  is not allowed. 
 
5.1.1 Central radiation QA review 

Diagnostic films and treatment plans will be reviewed centrally on all patients from each 
center.  The treatment plan for that segment of treatment required to be completed prior to 
randomization  (see  Section  5.1)  must  be  submitted  to  QARC  within  a  week  of  starting 
radiotherapy. If planning of later phases of treatment is deferred, the aggregate plan must 
be  submitted  no  later  than  the  fifth  week  of  treatment.  Treatment  plans  must  be 
accompanied by the documentation as set out in Section 5.1.12.  
 
5.1.2 Immobilization 

Patients should be positioned supine and immobilized using either a thermoplastic mask or 
a vacuum formed mask.  An intraoral stent or tongue depressor should be used if this will 
allow  a  greater  amount  of  the  tongue  or  oral  cavity  to  be  excluded  from  the  treatment 
volume. 
 
5.1.3 Standard simulation 

At simulation, relevant anatomical landmarks should be identified as appropriate. 
For  oral  cavity  tumors  a  radio-opaque  seed  to  define  the  anterior  margin  of  palpable 
disease should be inserted.   
 
On  the  simulation  film  the  lateral  projection  of  the  primary  tumor  and  nodal  disease 
should  be  marked  by  reconstructing  the  information  available  from  clinical  examination 
and CT/MRI scans.  Alternatively, all gross disease can be marked on the planning CT.  
Fields should be shaped with custom blocks or multi-leaf collimators to achieve maximum 
sparing  of  normal  tissues  while  achieving  adequate  tumor  coverage.    A  minimum  field 
margin of 2 cm around all gross disease and potential sites of subclinical involvement is 
required for the first phase of treatment.  A minimum field margin of 1 cm round gross 
disease  (as  defined  pre-treatment)  is  required  for  the  boost.    Skin  fall-off  should  be 
avoided anteriorly whenever possible.  Except in patients who have had an open biopsy of 
neck nodal disease, or in whom tumor is infiltrating the skin, no surface bolus should be 
used.   
 
5.1.4 Standard planning 

All patients must have a planning CT for dose calculation and to verify coverage of gross 
disease  in  the  treatment  volume.    At  a  minimum,  slices  for  isodose  calculation  must  be 
obtained at the central axis of the field, through the plane of maximum tumor bulk (if this 

30/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

does not coincide with the central axis) and 1 cm inside the upper and lower margins of 
the  fields.    In  the  plane  of  maximum  tumor  bulk  the  isodose  distribution  should  be 
overlaid on the CT image to confirm tumor coverage.   
 
For the first phase of treatment (on cord) fields should be planned where possible to avoid 
splitting any nodal disease.  For the second phase, if the location of nodal disease permits, 
oblique off cord fields are recommended to cover all gross disease.  If this is not possible 
abutting electron fields should be used to treat extensions of nodal disease posterior to the 
mid-vertebral  plane.    The  energy  of  the  electron  beam  must  be  determined  by  the 
thickness of nodal disease to ensure adequate coverage but at the same time avoiding too 
high  a  dose  to  the  spinal  cord.    In  the  event  that  immobilization  is  inadequate  due  to 
weight loss or significant regression of the node(s) during treatment a second planning CT 
scan is required. 
 
5.1.5 Standard dosimetry  

The  prescription  point  for  parallel  opposing  fields  is  in  the  midplane  of  the  central  axis 
(ICRU  50).    Missing  tissue  compensation  should  be  used  if  available  to  provide  dose 
homogeneity within the PTV.  The dose variation within 1.5 cm of gross disease should 
not exceed +7% and –5% of the prescription point dose.  Where an electron beam abuts a 
photon  beam  overlying  gross  disease  a  small  volume  hot  spot  of  up  to  120%  is 
permissible.  For electron fields the dose will be specified as the peak dose (D max) with 
energy chosen to deliver at least 90% to sites of gross disease.  The nominal tumor dose to 
gross  disease  as  defined  clinically  or  radiologically  shall  be  70  Gy  except  for  small 
volume  nodal  disease  (under  2  cm  diameter)  where  a  minimum  dose  of  60  Gy  shall  be 
specified.    Sites  of  potential  subclinical  involvement  shall  be  treated  to  50  Gy.    In  the 
lower neck this (subclinical disease) dose will be specified at a depth of 2 cm. 
 
If the junction plane between lateral and anterior neck fields provides a margin of less than 
1  cm  below  all  gross  nodal  disease,  the  subclinical  dose  should  be  increased  to  60  Gy 
within  a  buffer  zone  adjacent  to  gross  disease.    Likewise  clinically  impalpable  but 
radiologically suspicious (not definitely involved) nodes should be boosted to 60 Gy.  The 
dose to the spinal cord shall not exceed 40 Gy from the direct beams and shall not exceed 
45 Gy from all dose contributions.  If the location of gross disease mandates a higher cord 
dose  to  achieve  adequate  coverage  of  gross  disease,  a  cord  dose  of  up  to  48  Gy  is 
permitted.    Point  doses  to  the  spinal  cord  within  the  cone  down  volume  must  be 
calculated. 
 
5.1.6 Standard field verification 

Portal films should be taken weekly.  At least one portal film for each field (or hard copy 
of real time portal images) must be submitted for QA audit.   
 
5.1.7  Conformal planning 

A planning CT covering the entire volume from the floor of middle cranial fossa to the 
supra-sternal notch is required with slice separation of no more than 5 mm through sites of 

31/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

imageable  disease  and  10  mm  elsewhere.    The  planning  CT  should  be  fused  with 
diagnostic images whenever possible.  The gross tumor volume (GTV ) must be marked 
on  all  slices  where  imageable  disease  is  present.    Two  planning  target  volumes  (PTVs) 
must  be  marked:  PTV1  to  cover  the  GTV  (primary  and  involved  nodal  regions)  and 
potential areas of local extension or lymphatic spread with a minimum 1.5 cm margin, and 
PTV2 to cover the GTV (primary and involved lymph node regions) with a minimum 0.5 
cm  margin  in  all  planes.    In  cases  where  small  volume  neck  disease  is  present,  a  third 
PTV3  will  be  marked  to  cover  this  desease  with  a  minimum  0.5  cm  margin.    Parotid 
and/or submandibular gland sparing techniques are encouraged to the extent that coverage 
of the PTV is not compromised. 
 
5.1.8 Conformal dosimetry 

The prescription dose to PTV1 is 50 Gy, to PTV2 70 Gy, and to PTV3 60 Gy, all in 2 Gy 
fractions.  No more than 10% of PTV1 should receive less than 40 Gy.  At least 90% 
of PTV2 and all of the GTV shall receive a minimum of 66.5 Gy.  No more than 10% 
of  PTV2  (excluding  volumes  within  the  GTV  or  in  air  cavities),  should  receive  more 
than 75 Gy. No more than 10% of PTV3 (when used) should receive less than 57 Gy. 
The  maximum  spinal  cord  dose  should  not  exceed  45  Gy  from  all  fields,  unless  the 
location  of  gross  disease  mandates  a  higher  cord  dose  to  achieve  adequate  coverage  of 
gross disease, in which case a cord dose of up to 48 Gy is permitted.  Point doses to the 
spinal cord must be calculated for all relevant fields.  Composite isodose distributions and 
dose  volume  histograms  for  PTV1,  PTV2,  PTV3,  GTV,  and  the  spinal  cord  should  be 
submitted. 
 
5.1.9 Conformal treatment delivery verification 

Isocenter  verification  on  orthogonal  films  plus  BEV  and  REV  (Section  5.1.13)  are 
required. 
  
5.1.10 Fractionation 

For both arms of the trial, conventional once daily fractionation, 5 fractions per week are 
specified.  In the event of public holidays, missing treatment(s) should be made up in the 
same way as for treatment interruptions (see below). 
Every effort must be made to avoid protraction of treatment beyond 7 weeks.  Treatment 
interruptions  should  be  avoided  unless  there  is  severe  acute  toxicity  which  cannot  be 
managed conservatively.  In the event of a treatment interruption for any other reason, the 
missing  dose  fraction(s)  should  be  made  up  by  treatment  on  a  weekend  or  by  giving  a 
second treatment on one or more of the remaining treatment days with a minimum 6-hour 
interfraction  interval  provided  that  no  more  than  6  fractions  are  given  in  any  one  week.  
The reason for any treatment interruption must be documented.  Chemotherapy scheduling 
will be adjusted to conform to any break in radiotherapy.  (Section 5.2.1)   
 
5.1.11 Dose calculation and reporting  

Prescription point  

32/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

The monitor units required to deliver the prescribed dose to the prescription point shall be 
calculated and submitted. 
 
Dose uniformity  
For  standard  treatment  plans  the  maximum  and  minimum  doses  within  1.5  cm  of  gross 
disease shall be reported.  For conformal plans, the maximum and minimum doses in the 
PTV  shall  be  calculated  and  reported  as  per  ICRU  50.    These  may  be  extracted  from 
isodose distributions, calculated separately or derived from DVHs. 
 
Reference point  
The dose reference point calculated on this study is the isocenter.  The total dose to this 
point shall be calculated and reported. 
 
Critical organs  
The  maximum  dose  to  the  spinal  cord  shall  be  calculated,  recorded  in  the  treatment 
records,  and  submitted  with  the  QA  documentation.    For  patients  treated  with  volume-
based  techniques,  the  appropriate  dose  volume  histograms  shall  be  submitted.    This 
includes the parotids for patients treated with parotid sparing techniques. 
  
Isodose distribution  
An  isodose  plot  of  dose  distribution  in  the  central  transverse  plane  through  the  target 
volume shall be submitted.  In addition, dose distributions 1 cm inside the upper and lower 
margins of the fields shall also be submitted.  The prescription point and the outlines of 
the  planning  target  volume  and  critical  organs  shall  be  shown.    Isodose  values  must  be 
clearly  labeled.    The  effects  of  shielding  blocks  shall  be  included  and  corrections  for 
heterogeneity shall be shown. 
 
For volume based treatment planning, a hard copy isodose distribution for the total dose 
plan in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes, which includes the isocenter of the planning 
target  volume  (PTV)  must  be  submitted  (central  axis,  two  superior  and  two  inferior 
planes).  These dose distributions must include the following: 
 
A  sufficient  number  of  isodose  contours  should  be  shown  to  determine  that  the  dose 
distribution conforms to the protocol guidelines.  These isodoses should be superimposed 
over  treatment  planning  CT  or  MR  images.    However,  if  such  hard  copy  presents 
difficulty,  similar  plots  without  the  gray  scale  image  are  acceptable  if  enough  critical 
contours are identified to verify the dose distribution to target volumes and critical normal 
structures.    Specifically,  include  those  volumes  for  which  there  are  dose  volume 
histograms.

5.2 Chemotherapy 

Arm  1  –  Cisplatin  100  mg/m2  will  be  given  as  a  1-hour  infusion immediately (within 1 
hour) before radiotherapy on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 7 of radiotherapy.  Hydration will 
be required with each dose of cisplatin with the standard hydration schedule used at each 
institution.    Standard  antiemetic  regimens  for  cisplatin  should  be  used,  which  would 
generally include a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone.   
 
Arm  2  –  Tirapazamine  will  be  given  at  a  dose  of  290  mg/m2  via  a  2 hour  intravenous 
infusion  followed  after  a  1  hour  interval  by  cisplatin  75  mg/m2  as  a  1 hour  infusion 
immediately (within 1 hour) before radiotherapy on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 7.   
Tirapazamine alone at a dose of 160 mg/m2 will be given as a 2 hour infusion on days 1, 3, 
and 5 of weeks 2 and 3, with radiotherapy given not earlier than 30 minutes and not later 
than 2 hours after the end of the infusion.  Hydration will be required with each dose of 
cisplatin  with  the  standard  hydration  schedule  used  at  each  institution.    A  possible 
schedule  for  hydration  with  cisplatin  and  tirapazamine  is  outlined  in  Appendix  4.    For 
cisplatin and tirapazamine doses, an antiemetic regimen including a 5-HT3 antagonist and 
dexamethasone  is  required.    The  antiemetic  regimen  for  delayed  emesis  should  include 
dexamethasone.    In  Weeks  2  and  3  a  5-HT3  antagonist  and  4  mg  dexamethasone 
intravenously prior to each tirapazamine dose is generally adequate to control nausea and 
vomiting.  Diarrhea of short duration frequently occurs during or immediately following 
the  tirapazamine  infusion,  particularly  after  the  higher  dose  given  prior  to  cisplatin.  
Treatment of muscle cramps is symptomatic with analgesics and muscle relaxants such as 
benzodiazepines. 
 
For patients with a calculated body surface area >2.0 m2 but ≤2.2 m2 the Investigator may 
cap  the  dose  at  2.0  m2.    For  patients  with  a  calculated  body  surface  area  >2.2  m2,  the 
Investigator must cap the dose at 2.2 m2.

a  If the toxicity is clearly due to one of the chemotherapy drugs, then only the dose of that drug should 

be reduced. 

 
 
Tirapazamine toxicity 
The dose limiting toxicity in the Phase I trial has been neutropenia, which only occurred in 
the  last  2-3 weeks  of  treatment.    Muscle  cramps,  diarrhea,  and  rashes  do  not  generally 
require dose reductions or omission of doses.  Cramps and skin rashes do not appear to be 
dose  related.    Cramps  are  most  troublesome  in  the  first  2 weeks,  and  then  appear  to 
subside  despite  continuing  treatment  with  tirapazamine.    Tirapazamine  doses  may  be 
reduced  by  25%  following  severe  tirapazamine  related  toxicity,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
Investigator.  Hearing loss after tirapazamine has generally been seen at doses higher than 
are being used in this trial.  If acute reversible hearing loss (> Grade 2) occurs, then a 25% 

38/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

dose reduction of tirapazamine would be required for weeks 4 and 7, but not in weeks 2 
and 3 when a lower dose of tirapazamine is administered. 
 
Nausea  and  vomiting  predominantly  occur  following  combined  tirapazamine/cisplatin 
doses, and in general should not result in a dose reduction.  Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic 
toxicity  (apart  from  toxicities  mentioned  above)  that  is  due  to  the  chemotherapy  may 
require a dose delay for cisplatin/tirapazamine doses or a dose omission for tirapazamine 
alone  doses.    Subsequent  doses  may  be  reduced  by  25%  at  the  discretion  of  the 
Investigator.   
 
Delays 
• 

If  radiotherapy  is  interrupted  then  chemotherapy  will  also  be  delayed.    When 
radiotherapy  is  reintroduced,  chemotherapy  should  not  be  given  on  days  when  two 
fractions of radiation are given.   

Combined  cisplatin  and  tirapazamine  doses  on  the  experimental  arm  may  be 
delayed for up to 4 days if required (longer if radiotherapy has also been delayed).  If 
severe  chemotherapy  toxicity  persists  for  more  than  2  weeks  the  chemotherapy  drug 
related to that toxicity should be definitively discontinued. 

If cisplatin has been terminated due to toxicity, tirapazamine may still be given in 
weeks 4 and 7.  Tirapazamine alone doses in weeks 2 and 3 that cannot be given on the 
scheduled day due to toxicity will be omitted rather than delayed, unless radiotherapy 
had to be delayed as well.   

If radiotherapy is interrupted, missed doses of radiotherapy should be made up.  If 
chemotherapy is delayed or ceased due to toxicity then radiotherapy should continue to 
be given according to protocol.   

• 

• 

• 

No chemotherapy will be administered after completion of radiotherapy. 

• 
 
Chemotherapy toxicity will be graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC 
Version 2.0 Publish Date: April 30, 1999)  (Appendix 7).   
 
5.2.2 Management of neutropenia 

The dose limiting toxicity in the Phase I trial has been neutropenia, which only occurred in 
the  last  2-3 weeks  of  treatment.    Preliminary  analysis  of  the  first  50  patients  in  the 
randomized phase II trial showed that 30% percent of the patients on the tirapazamine arm 
had Grade 3 neutropenia and 3 % had grade 4  neutropenia.  12% of the patients on the 
tirapazamine  arm  had  febrile  neutropenia.    Although  the  neutropenia  is  often  mild,  it 
occurs when the acute mucous membrane and skin toxicities are at a maximum and when 
the  patients  are  at  a  high  risk  of  aspiration  pneumonia.    During  the  period  when  the 
patients are at greatest risk of febrile neutropenia (weeks 5-7) patients on both arms should 
check  their  temperatures  twice  a  day  and  notify  their  physician  of  temperatures  greater 
than  38°C.    Patients  who  develop  febrile  neutropenia  must  be  managed  carefully  and 
aggressively with fever work-up including blood cultures and chest x-ray and intravenous 
antibiotics.

5.3 Post-chemoradiation neck surgery 

Two months following completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients will have an evaluation 
described under assessment (Section 6.1). 
 
Provided there has been a complete response at the primary site, there are 3 management 
strategies  for  residual  resectable  neck  masses  that  can  be  adopted  on  this  trial.    Each 
institution must elect at the outset which of these 3 policies it wishes to adopt for this trial, 
and consistently apply the policy.  The 3 policy options are: 
 
1)  If there is a residual mass in the neck either clinically or radiologically at the 2-month 
evaluation point, a planned selective neck dissection will be performed within the next 
two months (by 4 months following completion of treatment) unless there is complete 
resolution of the residual mass in the interim. 

2)  If the neck mass is regressing, it will be kept under surveillance at monthly intervals 
up  to  a  further  6  months  (8  months  following  end  of  treatment)  with  surgery  being 
allowed at any time if the mass ceases regressing. 

3)  Planned neck dissection will be undertaken based on the pre-treatment maximum size 
of  neck  nodal  disease.  Institutions  may  elect  whether  the  threshold  for  dissection  is 
3cm  (≥  N2A)  or  6cm  (N3).  For  neck  masses  initially  <  3cm  in  size  that  have  not 
completely  regressed  at  the  2  month  post-treatment  evaluation,  policy  1  must  be 
followed.  Planned  bilateral  neck  dissections  should  be  staged  whenever  possible.  
 

With policies 1 and 2, no neck dissection will take place if there has been a clinical and 
radiological CR in the neck at the 2-month evaluation.  Regardless of the policy adopted 
for  the  management  of  the  neck,  any  surgical  intervention  requires  that  residual  nodal 
disease be deemed completely resectable. 
 
Patients who are thought to be in clinical CR at the primary site but have a minor residual 
imaging abnormality will be assumed to be in CR for the purposes of deciding about neck 
surgery.    When  there  is  considerable  edema  at  the  2-month  evaluation,  e.g.    laryngeal 
cancer,  that  makes  the  clinical  and  imaging  determination  of  CR  at  the  primary  site 
difficult, sites that have adopted policies 1 and 3, may revert to policy 2 for these patients.  
This  will  allow  more  time  to  clarify  the  response  at  the  primary  site  prior  to  any  neck 
dissection.   
 
5.4 Investigational product 

Tirapazamine  will  be  supplied  by  Sanofi-Synthelabo.  100,  200,  or  250  mL  of 
Tirapazamine  will  be  supplied  in  100,  200  or  300  mL  bottles,  respectively,  as  a  clear 
yellow-orange liquid (0.7 mg/mL) in an isotonic citrate buffer with a pH between 3.7 and 
4.3. 
 
 Tirapazamine is supplied in solution form that will not need dilution.  The total dose of 
tirapazamine for each subject scheduled to receive this drug should be transferred from the 
supplied  bottles  into  a  chemotherapy  bag/bottle  and  must  be  administered  via  infusion 

40/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

pump for the stated time interval.  Tirapazamine will not be administered with a diluent 
unless specifically stated. 
 
The dose of tirapazamine (TPZ) will be calculated as follows: 
 

BSA m x TPZ dose mg m

)

/

2

(

(
mg mL

/

.
0 7

2

)

=

TPZ volume mL

(

)

 

 
Thus,  for  a  subject  with  a  BSA  (body  surface  area)  =  1.85 m2  treated  at  a  tirapazamine 
dose of 290 mg/m2, the volume of tirapazamine to be administered would be 766 mL.  The 
volumes of the bottles may fluctuate slightly.  However, when the entire bottle containing 
the  expected  250  mL  of  solution  is  planned  to  be  used,  one  can  assume  the  volume  is 
correct and the actual volume does not need to be measured.  The possible excess is less 
than  3.5%.    Note  that  the  subject's  weight  and  BSA  must  be  re-evaluated  prior  to  each 
treatment cycle, with corresponding adjustment of dose as appropriate. 
 
Information on expiration dates of tirapazamine will be supplied on a lot-by-lot basis.  The 
Sponsor will notify the Investigator of any lots that are about to expire, and replacement 
supplies  will  be  shipped.    All  cancer  chemotherapeutic  agents  should  be  handled  with 
utmost care during preparation and administration.  To avoid any form of physical contact 
with the drug by the health care provider, gowns, gloves, and masks should be worn when 
appropriate.    As  a  parenteral  agent,  tirapazamine  should  be  prepared  in  a  vertical-flow 
biologic  safety  cabinet.    Refer  to  hospital  guidelines  for  any  additional  precautions  that 
may apply. 
 
Cisplatin will be handled in accordance with standard procedures for these cytotoxics at 
the institution. 
 
5.5 Method of assigning patients to treatment group 

Randomization  will  only  be  done  after  that  segment  of  treatment  planning  defined  in 
Section  5.1  has  been  completed.  At  sites  where  PET-FDG    scans  are  being  performed 
prior  to  treatment,  the  results  must  be  reviewed  before  randomization.    Randomization 
should take place as close as possible but not more than 2 weeks prior to the anticipated 
start of treatment.  Treatment assignment will be done centrally, by stratifying for disease 
stage  (III  v  IV),  primary  site  (oropharynx/larynx  v  hypopharynx/oral  cavity),  and 
hemoglobin  (≥13.5  g/dL  for  men  and ≥12.5  g/dL  for  women  v  otherwise).    A  dynamic 
allocation method will be used to avoid extreme imbalance of treatment assignment within 
an institution.   
 
5.6 Packaging and labelling 

100, 200, 250 mL of tirapazamine 0.7 mg/mL solution is supplied in 100, 200, 300 mL 
bottles. 
 

41/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

Tirapazamine  bottles  are  individually  labelled  with  a  booklet  label,  with  text  in  all 
languages  of  the  participating  countries,  and  a  separate  label  containing  variable 
information (product batch number). 
 
Four bottles are packaged in a labelled and sealed outer box, with a foam insert to hold the 
bottles in place, and either an absorbent pad (placed under the bottles) or absorbent sachets 
(placed alongside) in case of breakage.  Each outer box is sealed in a polythene bag. 
 
Outer cartons are labelled with booklet labels, a label “4x” to indicate that 4 bottles are in 
the carton and a label which details batch number and expiry date. 
 
5.7 Storage conditions 

Information on expiration dates of tirapazamine will be supplied on a lot-by-lot basis.  The 
Sponsor will notify the Investigator of any lots that are about to expire, and replacement 
supplies will be shipped.   
 
Tirapazamine  must  be  stored  between  15°C  and  30°C  in  the  light  proof  packaging 
provided.  During administration to subjects Tirapazamine must be protected from light, 
though  it  is  not  necessary  to  protect  infusion  lines.    As  an  investigational  agent, 
tirapazamine must be kept in a secure area and may be supplied only to subjects treated 
under the direction of the Investigator and in accordance with this protocol.   
 
Cisplatin will be stored in accordance with standard procedures for these cytotoxics at the 
institution. 
 
5.8 Responsibilities for investigational product 

The  Investigator,  the  Hospital  Pharmacist,  or  other  personnel  allowed  to  store  and 
dispense Investigational Product will be responsible for ensuring that the Investigational 
Product  used  in  the  study  is  securely  maintained  as  specified  by  the  Sponsor  and  in 
accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. 
 
All  Investigational  Product  shall  be  dispensed  in  accordance  with  the  Investigator's 
prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of 
Investigational Product issued and returned is maintained. 
 
Under  no  circumstances  will  the  Investigator  supply  Investigational  Product  to  a  third 
party, allow the Investigational Product to be used other than as directed by this protocol, 
or dispose of Investigational Product in any other manner. 
 
5.9 Retrieval and/or destruction of investigational product 
•  All partially used treatments should be destroyed at the site.  A detailed treatment log 
of the destroyed supplies will be established with the Investigator (or the pharmacist) 
and countersigned by the Investigator and the Monitoring Team.

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

•  At the end of the trial or upon for expiration. 
•  The  Investigator  will  destroy  the  unused  Investigational  Product  after  written 

authorization by the Sponsor or Sponsor's representative. 

 
5.10 Concomitant therapy 

5.10.1 Not permitted concomitant therapy 

Concomitant  therapy  with  agents  known  to  have  anticancer  activity  (including  systemic 
retinoids)  is  not  permitted  during  the  treatment  phase  of  the  study  and  follow  up  phase 
until  locoregional  failure  or  distant  metastasis.    Erythropoietin  is  not  allowed  while  the 
patient is on study. 
Subjects  may  not  participate  in  any  other  protocols  using  investigational  treatment(s)  or 
procedure(s)  while  participating  in  the  trial,  except  those  that  may  be  directly  related  to 
this trial and approved by the Trial Management Committee.   
 
5.10.2 Permitted concomitant therapy 

Medications  used  for  the  treatment  of  pre-existing  illnesses  or  new  symptoms  and 
illnesses are permitted unless they are not permitted (refer to the Section 5.10.1).  G-CSF  
and GM-CSF  are allowed for use during or after an episode of febrile neutropenia, but 
their use must be recorded.  However, G-CSF or GM-CSF must stop 24 hours before any 
chemotherapy  is  administered.    Use  of  long  acting  forms  of  G-CSF  e.g.,  peg-filgrastim 
(Neulasta)  are  not  permitted  on  this  study.  G-CSF  or  GM-CSF  should  not  be  used 
prophylactically (37) The unexpected finding has been reported that G-CSF had a negative 
impact on local control and survival in a study that first randomized patients to receiving 
either  hyper  fractionated  (HF)  accelerated  radiochemotherapy  or  hyper-fractionated 
accelerated radiotherapy in advanced H&N cancer followed by a second randomization to 
evaluate the prophylactic use of G-CSF. 
 
Blood transfusion 
Each institution, prior to commencing accrual,  is required to declare its policy with regard 
to blood transfusions during radiation. The policy should be applied to all patients treated 
at that site irrespective of which arm they are treated on. Due to significant differences in 
practice across the world a uniform blood transfusion policy has not been mandated. For 
centers that are uncertain about the best policy to adopt an example of one policy that will 
be  adopted  by  many  sites  is  to  maintain  hemoglobin  ≥10g/dl  during  radiation,  and  to 
arrange blood transfusion when hemoglobin drops below 10g/dl. Institutions may choose a 
different hemoglobin threshold  for transfusion, but the important point is for the chosen 
institutional policy to be applied to all patients treated on the trial.

6.  OUTCOME ASSESSMENT 

6.1 Efficacy 

6.1.1 Clinical assessment methods 

The  secondary  endpoints  require  the  determination  of  disease  status  at  the  end  of  the 
treatment  phase  and  sequentially  thereafter.    It  is  highly  important  to  have  objective 
definitions  and  measures  of  clinical  status  since  there  is  a  concern  that  bias  can  be 
introduced with the proposed definition of loco-regional failure.   
 
Clinical  follow-up  examinations  will  be  performed  by  members  of  a  qualified  head  and 
neck cancer team nominated by each institution.  Physical examination will include direct 
inspection and palpation of accessible sites and fiberoptic endoscopy.  The neck will be 
examined by palpation.  Imaging will be done at defined times (specified below) or at any 
time  there  is  clinical  suspicion  of  recurrence  or  progression.    Biopsy  or  cytological 
confirmation of recurrent disease should be obtained whenever possible. 
 
Imaging (CT or MRI depending on which was done prior to treatment) of primary site and 
neck will be performed at 2 months after treatment and prior to any surgery.  Patients with 
a  clinical  and  radiological  CR  in  the  neck  will  not  undergo  neck  dissection,  unless  the 
treating center has adopted a policy of routine neck dissection in all patients with baseline 
N2 (>3 cm) or N3 disease (Section 5.3).  Radiological CR requires that any residual nodal 
tissue is <1cm in maximum diameter and of homogeneous (non-necrotic) appearance.  For 
centers  with  PET  capability,  there  must  be  no  residual  metabolic  activity  on  18F-FDG 
scanning.   
 
Following  the  2-month  assessment,  patients  will  be  reviewed  for  disease  status  and 
toxicity assessments at least every 2 months the first year, every 3 months the second year 
and every 4 months the third year.  Imaging will be repeated every 4 months for the first 
year  and  then  every  6  months  or  until  study  cut-off.    Please  see  flow  chart  for  other 
assessments. 
 
6.1.2 Criteria of efficacy 

6.1.2.1 Primary criteria 

The  trial  will  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  concomitant  chemoradiation  with 
tirapazamine, cisplatin, and radiation versus cisplatin and radiation.  The primary endpoint 
will be overall survival. 
 
6.1.2.2 Secondary criteria 

The secondary endpoint is failure-free survival (FFS). Failure-free survival is the number 
of  months  from  randomization  until  the  earliest  of  locoregional  failure,  development  of 
distant metastasis, or death. 
Other tertiary endpoints include:

Time  to  locoregional  failure  with  date  of  randomization  as  the  start  date.  
Locoregional failure is defined in this study as the presence of persistent progressive or 
recurrent disease above the clavicles (see Section 6.1.2.6). 

Patterns of failure as the initial site of failure at the primary site, neck, distant sites 

or combinations of these. 

Cumulative  incidence  of  unacceptable  locoregional  treatment  outcome  as  a 
function of time.  An unacceptable outcome is defined as either locoregional failure or 
severe late (>90 days from the start of treatment) treatment-related toxicity which may 
be any of the following: grade 4 skin, subcutaneous tissue, mucous membrane or bone 
toxicity,  grade  3  or  4  spinal  cord  toxicity,  grade  4  laryngeal  toxicity  requiring 
tracheostomy,  or  the  need  for  enteral  feeding  persisting  beyond  12  months  following 
completion of treatment. 

Change in QoL from baseline as assessed by FACT-H&N scale in eligible patients 

at 6 months post-treatment (see 6.1.2.7 QoL Evaluation). 

Toxicity  and  safety,  determined  through  review  of  adverse  events,  routine 

symptom assessment, and laboratory determinations. 

Initial  response  rates  defined  as  rates  of  CR,  PR,  SD  or  PD  2  months  after 

completion of chemoradiation therapy as described in Section 6.1.2.5. 

Final CR rate as defined in Section 6.1.2.5 (d). 

• 
 
Additional analysis to include correlation of efficacy with baseline hypoxia measurements 
including  blood  levels  of  chemical  markers  for  hypoxia  as  directed  by  the  Trial 
Management Committee.  For example, correlation of hypoxia has been studied with the 
serum  markers,  osteopontin (38) and PAI-1.  Unstained slides of tumor biopsies will be 
collected for immunohistochemical analysis for prognostic markers such as Ki-67, HIF1α 
and p53. 
 
6.1.2.3 Measurement of response 

The  initial  response  will  be  determined  after  all  protocol  treatment  has  been  finished, 
whether or not all of the planned treatment is achieved.  This evaluation will be performed 
8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation therapy. 
 
The RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria, as modified below, 
will  be  followed  for  assessment  of  tumor  response  (39).    These  criteria  are  a  revised 
version  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  criteria  originally  published  in  1979.  
The  RECIST    criteria  were  developed  by  a  consensus  group  (including  the  WHO,  NCI 
Canada,  NCI  U.S.,  cooperative  oncology  groups  and  industry).    The  RECIST  criteria 
require confirmation of responses with a second study.  This trial does not conform to the 
usual chemotherapy trial with repeated doses of chemotherapy where confirmation makes 
sense.  In this trial, response will only be measured after a discrete period of concomitant 
therapy.    A  confirmatory  study  after  the  concomitant  therapy  would  not  be  appropriate 
since the initial assessment will occur 8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy.

6.1.2.4 Definition of measurable/non-measurable disease 

The following definitions of measurable and non-measurable disease will be used: 
 
• 

Measurable  disease:  lesions  that  can  accurately  be  measured  in  at  least  one 
dimension as ≥2.0 cm with conventional techniques or as ≥1.0 cm with spiral CT scan. 
The longest diameter (LD ) will be recorded.   

Non-measurable disease: all other lesions, including those with a longest diameter  

<2.0 cm with conventional techniques or as <1.0 cm with spiral CT scan. 

 
6.1.2.5  Definition of response 

Responses will be recorded separately for the primary site and the neck. 
 
6.1.2.5.1 Primary site 

• 

• 

• 

• 

RECIST  criteria  will  be  modified  to  take  into  account  clinical  (which  must  include 
fiberoptic examination for sites not amenable to direct inspection) and radiologic findings.   
 
• 

Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of the primary tumor.  A CR 
requires  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  disease  (other  than  an  equivocal  imaging 
abnormality at the primary site) by both clinical and radiologic criteria.   

Partial Response (PR): Decrease by 30% or greater in the LD of the primary lesion 
in reference to the baseline LD by both clinical and radiological criteria; or decrease by 
30% or greater in the LD of the primary lesion by radiologic criteria associated with 
definite  regression  by  fiberoptic  endoscopy  in  sites  not  amenable  to  direct  clinical 
measurement; or decrease by 30% or greater in the LD of the primary lesion by direct 
clinical  measurement  in  a  lesion  that  is  not  measurable  radiologically;  or  definite 
regression by fiberoptic endoscopy in a lesion that is not measurable either clinically or 
radiologically. 

Stable  disease  (SD):  Failure  to  observe  CR  or  PR  as  described  above,  in  the 

absence of progressive disease. 

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the LD of the primary lesion 
measured  clinically  or  radiologically  in  reference  to  the  smallest  LD  recorded  since 
initiation  of  treatment;  or  definite  evidence  of  progression  by  clinical  (including 
fiberoptic) examination for non-measurable lesions 

 
6.1.2.5.2 Neck nodal disease 

When  assessing  initial  disease  status,  nodes  which  are  not  palpable  but  which  may  be 
noted  on  CT/MRI  scans  with  diameters  of  <  1  cm  should  not  be  considered  a  site  of 
disease unless there is other evidence of involvement e.g., necrotic center.   
 
• 

Complete  Response  (CR):  Complete  disappearance  of  all  tumor  lesions.    When 
assessing  the  response  of  initially  involved  nodes,  all  of  which  regress  completely 

46/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

• 

• 

• 

clinically but persist on CT/MRI with a diameter < 1 cm and without central necrosis, a 
CR should be scored. 

Partial Response (PR): Decrease by 30% or greater in the sum of LD of all nodal 
lesions  in  reference  to  the  baseline  sum  LD,  both  clinically  and  radiologically.    No 
nodal lesions should have progressed and no new nodal lesions should have appeared. 

Stable  disease  (SD):  Failure  to  observe  CR  or  PR  as  described  above,  in  the 

absence of any progressive or new lesions. 

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of all nodal 
lesions in reference to the smallest sum LD recorded, either clinically or radiologically, 
since initiation of treatment and/or the appearance of any new nodal lesions. 

 
6.1.2.5.3 Initial response assessment 

Response  to  treatment  (CR,  PR,  SD,  or  PD)  will  be  assessed  only  at  8  weeks  post-
treatment,  prior  to  any  neck  dissection.    Subsequent  evaluations  will  be  based  solely  on 
whether or not locoregional failure has occurred. 
 
Patients who are clinically in CR but have a residual imaging abnormality at the primary 
site will be classified as ‘response pending’.  Documentation of stable imaging appearance 
on 2 consecutive CTs at least 4 months apart without any clinical evidence of recurrence 
will result in classification of their response at 8 weeks as CR. 
 
6.1.2.5.4 Final complete response rate 

It  is  recognized  that  response  rates  in  the  neck  at  8  weeks  will  underestimate  the  true 
pathologic  CR  rate.    This  will  be  estimated  retrospectively  as  the  proportion  of  patients 
who  ever  achieve  CR  without  surgery  or  have  negative  pathology  at  planned  neck 
dissection with primary disease controlled. 
 
6.1.2.6  Definition of locoregional failure 

Locoregional failure is defined for this study as the occurrence of persistent, progressive, 
or  recurrent  disease  above  the  clavicles.    Patients  with  persistent  primary  disease  at  the 
two-month post-treatment assessment will be regarded as having failed at the time of that 
assessment.    Because  a  planned  neck  dissection  for  persistent  (but  not  progressive) 
resectable nodal masses is part of the treatment “package”, pathologic evidence of residual 
tumor  in  the  neck  dissection  specimen  will  not  be  regarded  as  a  locoregional  failure.  
Patients with residual neck masses who do not undergo neck surgery will be deemed as 
having failed only at the time of progression.  Patients who undergo neck dissection for 
residual disease, which is found to be unresectable, will be deemed to fail at the time of 
surgery.  Date of progression or recurrence is defined as the date of a measurable event, 
either  clinical,  radiological  or  pathological.    Clinically  or  radiologically  manifest  tumor 
recurrence should be confirmed by biopsy or cytology whenever possible. 
 
Patients with a clinical CR at the primary site who have a residual imaging abnormality at 
the primary site will undergo further imaging 4 months later and will be deemed to have 

47/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

locoregional failure in the primary site only if the imaging abnormality progresses.  Some 
patients  with  laryngeal  primaries  may  be  unassessable  at  the  2-month  post-treatment 
evaluation  because  of  edema  of  the  larynx.    Such  patients  should  be  continued  to  be 
followed clinically and radiographically.  These patients will be classified as locoregional 
failure  only  if  and  when  progression  is  documented.    In  the  absence  of  a  target  lesion 
biopsy is not recommended.  For unusual clinical scenarios not covered above, a ruling of 
the occurrence of locoregional failure will be submitted to the principal investigators who 
will make a decision without knowing the treatment arm. 
 
Patients with distant metastasis will continue to be followed for locoregional failure status.   
 
Second primary cancers 
A newly diagnosed cancer arising in any site involved by or adjacent to the index cancer 
must be designated as a local recurrence (e.g. epiglottis and base of tongue).  A second 
primary neoplasm can only be declared when the second lesion is in a non-adjacent subsite 
(e.g., soft palate and glottic larynx) or is contralateral to an index cancer, which did not 
approach the midline (e.g., right and left tonsil). 
 
6.1.2.7  Quality-of-life evaluation 

To maximize the ability of a questionnaire to discriminate between groups of patients and 
to respond to changes in QoL between patients, it is necessary to choose a disease-specific 
instrument  that  measures  the  concerns  of  patients  with  head  and  neck  cancer  (40).    To 
maximize  the  reliability  and  internal  validity  of  the  QoL  results,  participants  must 
complete  their  own  questionnaires  without  family  input.    To  maximize  the  validity  and 
generalization  of  QoL  results,  all  eligible  patients  should  participate  in  the  QoL 
component  of  the  study.    Thus,  the  questionnaire  must  be  available  in  the  multiple 
languages  in  use  at  the  participating  centres.    For  QoL  results  to  be  interpretable,  a 
standard questionnaire with known validity and reliability must be used.   
 
QoL assessment is mandatory in all patients, excluding only those who meet the following 
criteria: 
1)  Inability  to  comprehend  at  least  one  of  the  following  languages:  (English,  Dutch, 

French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Chinese, Polish, Russian) 

2)  Inability to comprehend QoL questions due to cognitive or psychiatric deficits. 
3)  In  blind  or  illiterate  patients  the  FACT-H&N  should  be  administered  verbally.  
Whenever possible, all QoL assessments should take place during the scheduled clinic 
visits, and prior to the physician's assessment. 

 
6.1.2.7.1  FACT-H&N Quality-of-life questionnaire 

For  this  study,  the  FACT-H&N    has  been  chosen.    The  FACT-H&N,  developed  by  Dr.  
David  Cella  and  colleagues  in  the  United  States  (41),  comprises  a  core  questionnaire 
called  FACT-G,  and  a  disease-specific  subscale.    It  was  designed  for  descriptive, 
discriminative  and  evaluative  use  (42).    The  core  questionnaire  and  head  and  neck 
modules have been tested for reliability and validity (42) (43) (44).  Clinical trials have 

48/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

shown improvements in scores with time from treatment, which is a preliminary indicator 
of  responsiveness  (44)  (45)  (46).  The  minimal  important  difference,  a  measure  of  the 
clinical  significance  of  a  small  change  in  questionnaire  scores  over  time,  has  been 
measured  and  corresponds  to  a  5-10%  difference  in  score  (47).    Patients  typically 
complete the questionnaire in 10-15 minutes (48). 
 
The  FACT  instruments  are  self-administered  multi-item  indices  using  category-rating 
scales.    FACT-G  consists  of  27  questions  in  4  domains:  physical  (7  questions), 
social/family  (7  questions),  emotional  (6  questions),  and  functional  (7  questions).    The 
38-item  FACT-H&N  also  includes  an  11-item  head  and  neck  cancer  specific  subscale.  
Each response is rated from 0-4 on a Likert index, considering the past 7 days.   
 
Items  H&N8  and  H&N9  are  currently  not  scored.    For  all  other  items,  scores  are 
calculated separately for each domain.  Scores range from 0 to 28 for physical, social, and 
functional  domains  and  from  0  to  24  for  the  emotional  dimension.    An  unweighted 
summary score is calculated for the FACT-G and the total FACT-H&N.  The maximum 
score of 144 (27 + 9 = 36 items scored between 0 and 4) reflects the best possible quality 
of  life.    Because  pain  is  often  a  dominant  symptom  of  recurrent  head  and  neck  cancer, 
item  GP4  of  FACT-G  (I  have  pain)  will  also  be  analyzed  as  a  single  item  pain  index.  
Analgesic use will therefore also be assessed at the time of each QoL assessment. 
 
6.1.2.7.2 Timing of assessment 

Quality of life and pain will be assessed at the following time points: at baseline (prior to 
treatment), 2 months post treatment, 6 months post-treatment, 12 months post-treatment, 
23 months post-treatment and 38 months post-treatment. 
 
6.2 Safety 

Toxicity and safety will be determined through review of adverse events, routine symptom 
assessment, and laboratory determinations. 
 
6.3 Pharmacokinetics 

Not applicable. 
 

7.  PATIENT SAFETY 

7.1 Adverse events monitoring 

Definitions:  
 
An  Adverse  Event  is  any  untoward  medical  occurrence  in  a  patient  or  clinical 
investigation  patient  administered  a  pharmaceutical  product  and  which  does  not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
 

49/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•  Results in death or 
•  Is life-threatening or 

Note: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe. 

 

•  Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or  
•  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or 
•  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
•  Is a medically important event 
 
Medical  and  scientific  judgment  should  be  exercised  in  deciding  whether  expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient  or  may  require  intervention  to  prevent  one  of  the  other  outcomes  listed  in  the 
definition above. 
 
These should also usually be considered serious. 
 

Note: Examples  of  such  events  are  intensive  treatment  in  an  emergency  room  or  at  home  for  allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions or symptomatic ALT increase * 10 ULN that do not 
result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 

 
Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug, including those 
occurring  during  the  wash-out  period  (where  applicable),  are  to  be  recorded  on  the 
corresponding page(s) included in the Case Report Form.  Whenever possible, symptoms 
should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis.  The Investigator should specify the 
date  of  onset,  maximal  intensity,  action  taken  with  respect  to  study  drug,  corrective 
therapy given, outcome and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility 
that the Adverse Event was caused by the study drug. 
 
Serious Adverse Events 
In the case of a Serious Adverse Event the Investigator must immediately: 
•  SEND (within 1 working day, preferably by fax) the signed and dated corresponding 
page(s) in the Case Report Form to the representative of the Monitoring Team whose 
name and address and fax number appear on the protocol; 

•  ATTACH the photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these 
examinations  were  performed.    For  laboratory  results,  include  the  laboratory  normal 
ranges. 

 
Follow-up 
•  The  Investigator  should  take  all  appropriate  measures  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the 
patients,  notably  he/she  should  follow  up  on  the  outcome  of  any  Adverse  Events 

50/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

(clinical  signs,  laboratory  values  or  other,  etc.)  until  the  return  to  normal  or  until 
consolidation of the patient conditions. 

•  In the case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient must be followed up until clinical 
recovery  is  complete  and  laboratory  results  have  returned  to  normal,  or  until 
progression has been stabilized.  This may imply that follow-up will continue after the 
patient  has  left  the  study  and  that  additional  investigations  may  be  requested  by  the 
Monitoring Team. 

•  In case of any Serious Adverse Event brought to the attention of the Investigator at any 
time after cessation of study treatment and considered by him/her caused by the study 
drug with a reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the Monitoring Team. 

 
Grading adverse events:  
Acute  radiation  and  all  chemotherapy  toxicities  will  be  graded  using  CTC  Version  2.0 
(Appendix 7).  In the case of toxicities within the irradiated volume occurring from the 2-
month follow-up visit onwards, the RTOG Late Radiation Toxicity scale) (Appendix 7), 
modified  to  include  pharyngeal  toxicity  and  ototoxicity,  will  be  used.    An  exception 
relates to acute mucositis, which must be graded according to the CTC criteria until it has 
resolved to grade 1. 
 
7.2 Laboratory tests monitoring 

See Study Procedures (Section 9) the tests needed. 
 
7.3 Safety instruction 

The following events, should they meet the criteria of seriousness, are not to be considered 
as SAE: 
• 

any non fatal event secondary to documented cancer progression.  These events are 
collected elsewhere in the CRF  since they do not impact the endpoints of the study.  
The cases of death related to cancer progression are reported as SAEs as usual. 

any  event  that  is  included  in  the  cancer  management  such  as  hospitalization  for 

insertion of a central venous catheter device or an enteral feeding tube. 

• 

 

8.  PATIENT WITHDRAWAL 

8.1 Criteria for withdrawal from treatment 

Protocol treatment should be discontinued if it is considered to be in the best interest of 
the patient.  Reasons for treatment discontinuation include: 
1)  Patient request 
2)  Patient non-compliance with the protocol 
3)  Life threatening or other unacceptable drug-related toxicity 
4)  Progressive disease 
5)  Physician decision in view of patient’s other medical conditions. 
 

51/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

When treatment is discontinued, the reason(s) for discontinuation should be documented 
in  the  patient’s  medical  record  and  CRF,  and  follow-up  should  be  maintained  and 
reported.    When  discontinued  from  protocol  treatment,  patients  will  still  be  followed  as 
defined in the protocol. 
 
8.2 Withdrawal from study 

The  patients  may  withdraw  from  the  study  if  they  decide  to  do  so,  at  any  time  and 
irrespective of reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. 
 
8.3 Withdrawal from follow-up  

For  patients  considered  lost  to  follow-up,  the  CRF  must  be  filled  in  up  to  the  last  visit 
performed.    The  Investigator  should  make  every  effort  to  re-contact  and  to  identify  the 
reason why the patient failed to attend the visit and to determine his/her health status. 
 
8.4 Consequence 

Patients  who  have  been  withdrawn  from  the  study  cannot  be  re-included  in  the  study.  
Their inclusion and treatment number must not be re-used.

treatment  and 

Please see flow chart for details of assessments.  Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation 
is frequently associated with significant acute severe toxicity that requires as standard of 
care  frequent  follow-up  during 
immediate  post-treatment  period.  
Biochemistry assessment will be done weeks 1, 4 and 7.  Weekly hematology assessments 
will  be  done.    In  weeks  5-7  hematology  assessment  will  be  done  twice  weekly.  
Hematology  assessment  will  include:  hemoglobin,  WBC,    absolute  neutrophil  count 
(ANC), and platelets.  Biochemistry assessment will include sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, urea, glucose, creatinine, total protein, albumin, SGOT 
(AST), SGPT (ALT) , alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.  Toxicity assessment will 
be performed weekly. 
 
Toxicity assessment will be done at two weeks after radiation is completed.  Patients with 
severe acute toxicities will require weekly follow-up. 
 
9.3.2  Four-weeks follow-up visit 

The patient will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last radiation therapy.  Please see 
flow chart for details of assessments. 
 
9.3.3  Follow-up visits 

Following  the  2-month  assessment,  patients  will  be  reviewed  for  disease  status  and 
toxicity assessments every 2 months until 14 months, every 3 months until 32 months and 
then  6  monthly  until  the  study  end.  Imaging  will  be  repeated  every  4  months  until  14 
months,  then  at  6  monthly  intervals  for  the  remainder  of  the  study.  This  schedule  is  to 
allow for clinical and radiological assessment to be done on the same visit. Please see flow 
chart for other assessments. 
 
9.4 Definition of source data 

Source  data  is  defined  as  all  information  in  original  records  of  clinical  findings, 
observations,  or  other  activities  of  the  clinical  trial  necessary  for  the  reconstruction  and 
evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Source documents 
are  the  original  documents,  data  and  records.    Source  documents  include  but  are  not 
limited  to  hospital  records,  clinical  and  office  charts,  laboratory  notes  and  reports

10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

10.1 Statistical and analytical plans 

This  protocol  contains  a  general  description  of  the  statistical  design  and  of  the  analyses 
that  will  be  done  to  compare  Arms  1  (cisplatin  +  radiotherapy)  and  2  (cisplatin  + 
tirapazamine  +  radiotherapy)  for  the  primary  endpoint  of  overall  survival.    Methods  are 
also described for the analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints and safety. 
 
10.2 Determination of sample size 

The  sample  size  of  425  per  treatment  arm  will  provide  at  least  90%  power  under  the 
following assumptions: 
• 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
The control arm specifications and the difference this trial is powered to detect are based 
on a review of similar trials in this disease (Section 1.5) 
 
The cutoff date for patients included in the final survival analysis is planned to be the date 
of the 334h death.   
 
An  analysis  of  failure-free  survival  (FFS)  will  be  done  with  a  Cox  proportional  hazards 
regression model by incorporating the dichotomous factors of treatment arm, disease stage 
(III  vs  IV),  primary  site  (oral  cavity/hypopharynx  vs  oropharynx/larynx),  hemoglobin 
(≥13.5  g/dL  for  men  or  ≥12.5  g/dL  for  women  vs  otherwise),  and  ECOG  performance 
status (0 vs 1,2). 
 
The analysis of failure-free survival has greater than 90% power based on the following 
assumptions: 
• 

Mortality rate in the control and test arms as described in the first paragraph of this 

section 

56/112 

CPRR04-EFC4690-EN-E01 

SANOFI-SYNTHELABO 

• 

• 

• 

• 
• 
• 

Locoregional failure/distant metastasis rates of 40% in the control arm and 25% in 
the test arm, with a yearly event probability of 0.7 among patients who will experience 
this event 

Lost to follow-up rate of 20% in 3.5 years, with losses following an exponential 

distribution 

Event  risks  for  mortality,  locoregional  failure/distant  metastasis,  and  loss  to 

follow-up are independent 

Analysis done when 245 total events have been observed 
Two-sided log rank test at the 0.05 level 
Risks  and  postulated  locoregional  failure/distance  metastasis  rates  of  40%  in  the 
control arm versus 25% in the experimental arm with a two-sided test at the 0.05 level. 
Under trial assumptions the analysis of FFS locoregional failure will occur approximately 
2.5 years after the start of the study. 
 
10.3 Study patient description 

All  randomized  patients  with  previously  untreated  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  oral 
cavity,  oropharynx,  hypopharynx  or  larynx  will  be  considered  in  the  intent-to-treat 
population. 
 
All patients who receive at least one dose of the assigned study treatment will be included 
in the safety analysis. 
 
10.3.1 Disposition of patients 

The  numbers  of  patients  who  are  randomized  will  be  shown  by  treatment  arm.    The 
number  of  post-randomization  discontinuations  will  be  displayed  by  treatment  arm  and 
reason for stopping treatment.  Follow-up status after discontinuation will be summarized. 
 
10.3.2 Protocol deviations 

Listings of patients with identified protocol deviations will be provided.  Major protocol 
deviations include, but are not limited to,  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
 

Violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimens not specified in the protocol. 
Failure to follow dose modification procedure in the protocol. 
Receipt of concomitant anti-cancer treatment prohibited by the protocol. 
Missing data in key efficacy or safety parameters.

10.4 Data analysis considerations 

10.4.1 Dataset analyzed 

10.4.1.1 Treatment group considered for statistical analysis 

Two treatment groups are in this study: Cisplatin + Radiotherapy (Arm 1) versus Cisplatin 
+ Tirapazamine + Radiotherapy (Arm 2). 
 
10.4.1.2 Populations to be analyzed 

Primary  statistical  analysis  will  be  done  following  intent  to  treat  principles  (see 
Section 10.3.). 
 
All patients who receive assigned study treatment will be included in the safety analysis. 
 
10.4.2 General Statistical Approach 

A  Cox  proportional  hazards  regression  model  incorporating  the  dichotomous  factors  of 
treatment  arm,  disease  stage  (III  vs  IV),  primary  site  (oral  cavity/  hypopharynx/  vs 
oropharynx/larynx),  hemoglobin  (≥13.5  g/dL  for  men  and  ≥12.5  g/dL  for  women  vs 
otherwise),  and  ECOG  performance  status  (0  vs  1,2),  will  be  used  to  compare  the 
treatment groups for the time-related endpoints overall survival, failure free survival and 
time to locoregional failure. 
 
Categorical parameters, such as response rate, will be evaluated using the chi-squared test.  
Repeated measurement data, like QoL will be compared by change from the baseline at 
fixed  time  points.    The  primary  QoL  outcome  will  be  a  comparison  of  change  from 
baseline  in  FACT  H&N  score  at  the  6-month  assessment  between  control  and 
experimental groups using Student’s t-test.   
 
Characteristics of subjects assigned to the two treatment arms will be summarized.  These 
include sex, race, age, weight, height, performance status, histology, stage of disease, and 
measurable  disease  by  RECIST  criteria,  time  since  diagnosis,  presence  of  other  disease 
conditions, and clinical laboratory tests. 
 
10.4.3 General conventions 

10.4.3.1 General rules for data handling of missing, unused or inconsistency data 

In  general  there  will  be  no  imputation  of  missing  data.    In  the  time  to  event  analyses 
missing data due to reasons other than the defined event will be considered censored.  For 
the repeatedly measured variables, the amount of missing data will be described for each 
treatment arm.

N/A 
 
10.5 Demographic and baseline characteristics 

Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  will  be  summarized  by  treatment  arm.  
Continuous  variables  (such  as  age,  weight,  etc.)  will  be  summarized  using  the  mean, 
standard  deviation,  minimum,  and  maximum.    Qualitative  characteristics  (such  as  race, 
disease stage, etc.) will be summarized by counts and percents. 
 
10.5.1 Patient demographic characteristics, medical history and diagnoses 

Patient  demographic  characteristics  include  country,  age,  weight,  sex,  race,  and 
performance status.  Medical history will include all information collected in the relevant 
CRF.  Diagnosis information will include primary site, disease stage, and laboratory tests.

10.7.1 Primary efficacy variable(s) 

10.7.1.1 Description of the primary variable(s) 

Overall survival measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any 
cause will be the primary endpoint.  Overall survival will be censored by the cutoff date or 
the date of last follow-up for patients lost to follow-up. 
 
Safety  will  be  assessed  through  review  of  adverse  events,  routine  symptom  assessment, 
and laboratory determinations. 
 
10.7.1.2 Primary analysis 

A  Cox  proportional  hazards  regression  model  incorporating  the  dichotomous  factors  of 
treatment  arm,  prognostic  factors  of  ECOG  performance  status  (0  vs  1,2),  disease  stage 
(III vs IV), primary site (oral cavity/hypopharynx vs oropharynx/larynx), and hemoglobin 
(≥13.5 g/dL for men and ≥12.5 g/dL for women vs otherwise) will be used for the primary 
analysis  of  overall  survival.  The  cut-off  date  for  patients  included  in  the  final  overall 
survival analysis will be the date of the 334th death.  
 
Analysis of failure-free survival will be done when 245 FFS events have been observed, 
and  results  for  this  parameter  may  be  reported  prior  to  completion  of  follow-up  for 
survival.  Testing  will  be  done  with  Cox  proportional  hazards  regression  model 
incorporating the dichotomous factors of treatment arm, ECOG performance status (0 vs 
1,2), disease stage (III v IV), primary site (oral cavity/hypopharynx vs oropharynx/larynx), 
and hemoglobin (≥13.5 g/dL for men and ≥12.5 g/dL for women vs otherwise).  
 
Three interim analyses for survival are planned. The first one is calendar-based and will 
have a cutoff 1 ½ years after the trial is in full operation (arbitrarily defined as 15 March 
2003,  when  >  50  sites  have  study  drug  available).  Thus,  the  cutoff  for  the  first  interim 
analysis will be 15 September, 2004. The second interim analysis will be done with the 
same cutoff as the final FFS analysis, i.e. the date of the 245th FFS event. The third interim 
analysis  will  be  done  with  a  cutoff  equal  to  the  date  of  the  282nd  death.  Under  trial 
assumptions the date of the 282nd death is expected to be approximately 1 year after the 
end  of  accrual.  All  interim  analyses  of  survival  will  be  done  using  Cox  proportional 
hazard  model  comparing  treatment  arms  adjusted  for  prognostic  factors  ECOG 
performance status (0 vs 1,2), disease stage (III v IV), primary site (oropharynx/larynx v 
hypopharynx/oral cavity), and hemoglobin (≥ 13.5 g/dl for men or ≥ 12.5 g/dl for women 
v otherwise).

Type I error will be controlled by the O’Brien – Fleming alpha spending function [2 – 2 x 
Φ(Z0.975/sqrt(t*)), where Φ is the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal, 
and t* is the proportion of deaths, out of 334 that will be observed at the cutoff date for the 
overall  survival  analysis.]  (49).  The  first  interim  survival  analysis  will  be  done  at  0.001 
level,  since  the  O'Brien-Fleming  alpha  spending  function  is  conservative  and  specifies 
very low critical values when the number of events is small. The significance level for the 
second  interim  analysis  will  be  the  larger  of  0.001  and  the  level  determined  by  the 
O'Brien-Fleming  alpha  spending  function.  This  modified  spending  function  will  still  be 
monotone, and requires modest adjustment of the level of the final test.

Not applicable. 
 
10.7.1.2.3 Main statistical model and adjustment for covariates 

Not applicable. 
 
10.7.1.2.4 Multiple comparisons/multiplicity 

Three interim analyses of overall survival have been specified in the protocol. The level of 
first test will be 0.001. The levels of subsequent tests will be determined by the O'Brien-
Fleming alpha spending function as a function of the proportion of 334 deaths that have 
been observed (Section 10.7.1.2). Using an alpha-spending approach, the level of the final 
statistical test will be adjusted appropriately to maintain an overall type I error of 0.05. 
 
To ensure that total  type I error of tests of the other endpoints in the trial is controlled 
within 0.05 level, the statistical tests for the other endpoints will be conducted in the order 
of  time  to  locoregional  failure,  final  CR  rate,  change  in  QoL  from  baseline,  cumulative 
incidence  of  unacceptable  locoregional  treatment  outcome,  following  the  analysis  of 
overall survival and failure-free survival. 
 
10.7.1.3 Other Analyses for primary variable(s) 

Since patients eligible for this study are at high risk of non-cancer mortality, a statistically 
significant  effect  on  FFS  may  fail  to  translate  into  a  significant  observed  survival 
difference. In the absence of demonstrated superiority of the test arm for overall survival, 
it would be of clinical interest to know if the composite result of non-inferior survival and 
superior  FFS  could  be  demonstrated.  A  treatment  that  provided  longer  FFS  and  non-
inferior survival could be considered to be associated with clinical benefit. 
 
If the study does not demonstrate superiority for the test arm in terms of overall survival, a 
composite endpoint of FFS and survival will be evaluated as follows. 
 
The composite test will be done using the closed testing procedure (Case B) described in 
(50). If the null hypothesis, H1:OStest=OScontrol, is not rejected in favor of the test arm at the 
two-sided 0.05 level, then the non-inferiority hypothesis, H2: OStest<OScontrol, will be tested 
at the one-sided 0.05 level. Rejection of H2 would be equivalent to rejecting H1 in favor of 
the test arm at a two-sided 0.10 level, and could be considered a positive trend in survival. 
A  third  null  hypothesis,  H3:  FFStest=FFScontrol,  will  be  tested  at  the two-sided 0.05 level, 
using the larger of the p-values from the tests of FFS after 245 failures and at the end of 
the study. Rejection of H3 (in favor of the test arm) and either H1 (in favor of the test arm) 
or  H2  would  demonstrate  a  favorable  result  for  the  test  arm  in  terms  of  the  composite 
endpoint FFS and OS. This composite endpoint is considered supplemental to the primary 
endpoint of survival and the secondary endpoint of FFS. Under H1 and H3, evaluation of 
the composite endpoint does not inflate type I error.

10.7.2 Secondary / other efficacy variables 

 
10.7.2.1 Description of secondary variables 

The secondary endpoint is failure-free survival (FFS). Failure-free survival is the number 
of  months  from  randomization  until  the  earliest  of  locoregional  failure,  development  of 
distant metastasis, or death. 
Other tertiary endpoints include: 
• 

Time  to  locoregional  failure  with  date  of  randomization  as  the  start  date.  
Locoregional failure is defined as the presence of persistent, progressive, or recurrent 
disease above the clavicles (Section 6.1.2.6.) 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 
• 

Patterns of failure as the initial site of failure at the primary site, neck, distant sites 

or combinations of these. 

Cumulative  incidence  of  unacceptable  locoregional  treatment  outcome  as  a 
function of time.  An unacceptable outcome is defined as either locoregional failure or 
severe late (>90 days from the start of treatment) treatment-related toxicity which may 
be any of the following: grade 4 skin, subcutaneous tissue, mucous membrane or bone 
toxicity,  grade  3  or  4  spinal  cord  toxicity,  grade  4  laryngeal  toxicity  requiring 
tracheostomy,  or  the  need  for  enteral  feeding  persisting  for  12  months  or  more 
following completion of treatment.  The date of unacceptable outcome based on enteral 
feeding will be recorded as 12 months after completion of treatment.  Death will be a 
competing  event  and  the  cut-off  date  or  date  of  last  follow-up  for  patients  lost  to 
follow-up will be censoring events. 

Change in QoL from baseline as assessed by FACT-H&N scale in eligible patients 

at 6 months post-treatment (see 6.1.2.7 QoL Evaluation). 

Toxicity  and  safety,  determined  by  through  review  of  adverse  events,  routine 

symptom assessment, and laboratory determinations. 

Initial  response  rates  defined  as  rates  of  CR,  PR  ,  SD    or  PD    2  months  after 

completion of chemoradiation therapy which is described in (Section 6.1.2.5). 

Final CR rate as defined in section 6.1.2.5 (d) 
Additional  analysis  to  include  correlation  of  efficacy  with  baseline  hypoxia 
measurements including blood levels of chemical markers for hypoxia as directed by 
the  Trial  Management  Committee.    For  example,  correlation  of  hypoxia  has  been 
studied  with  the  serum  markers,  osteopontin  and  PAI-1.    Unstained  slides  of  tumor 
biopsies  will  be  collected  for  immunohistochemical  analysis  for  prognostic  markers 
such as Ki-67, HIF1α and p53. 

 
10.7.2.2 Statistical analysis of secondary variables

who  receive  cisplatin  but  not  tirapazamine  will  be  included  in  the  cisplatin  arm1.    Any 
patient receiving tirapazamine will be included in the cisplatin + tirapazamine arm 2. 
 
Safety analyses for patients receiving only radiotherapy will be presented separately. 
 
10.8.1 Adverse events 

10.8.1.1 Definitions 

Adverse events are recorded by episode.  For each occurrence of an AE, the onset date, 
resolution date, maximum grade, and action taken are recorded.   
 
10.8.1.2 Treatment-emergent adverse events 

An AE is considered treatment emergent if the onset date is on or after the first day of the 
first  cycle  of  study  treatment.    Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  are  summarized  by 
body  system  and  preferred  term,  showing  the  incidence  and  maximum  grade  by  patient 
and by cycle for each treatment arm. 
 
10.8.1.3 Deaths and serious adverse events 

All deaths and the causes of death will be listed by treatment arm.  Serious adverse events 
will be summarized and compared by treatment arm. 
 
10.8.1.4 Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 

Adverse  events  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  will  be  listed,  and  the  numbers  of 
patients  discontinuing  due  to  an  adverse  event  will  be  compared  between  the  two 
treatment groups. 
 
10.8.2 Clinical laboratory evaluations 

Clinical  laboratory  data  will  be  graded  according  to  the  NCI    common  toxicity  criteria 
version  2.0  (April  30,  1999).    The  numbers  of  patients  with  any  abnormality  and  with 
grade 3,4 abnormalities will be compared between the treatment arms.

12.1 Responsibilities of the Investigator(s) 

The  Investigator(s)  undertake(s)  to  perform  the  study  in  accordance  with  this  protocol, 
Good Clinical Practice and the applicable regulatory requirements. 
 
The  Investigator  is  required  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  Investigational  Product 
schedule, visit schedule and procedures required by the protocol.  The Investigator agrees 
to provide all information requested in the Case Report Form in an accurate and legible 
manner  according  to  the  instructions  provided  and  to  ensure  direct  access  to  source 
documents to Sponsor representatives. 
 
12.2 Responsibilities of the Sponsor 

The  Sponsor  of  this  study  is  responsible  to  Health  Authorities  for  taking  all  reasonable 
steps  to  ensure  the  proper  conduct  of  the  study  as  regards  ethics,  protocol  compliance, 
integrity and validity of the data recorded on the Case Report Forms.  Thus, the main duty 
of the Monitoring Team is to help the Investigator and the Sponsor maintain a high level 
of ethical, scientific, technical and regulatory quality in all aspects of the study. 
 
At  regular  intervals  during  the  study,  the  centre  will  be  contacted,  through  site  visits, 
letters  or  telephone  calls,  by  a  representative  of  the  Monitoring  Team  to  review  study 
progress, Investigator and patient compliance to protocol requirements and any emergent 
problems.    During  monitoring  visits,  the  following  points  will  be  scrutinized  with  the 
Investigator:  patient  informed  consent,  patient  recruitment  and  follow-up,  study  drug 
allocation,  patient  compliance  with  the  Investigational  Product,  Investigational  Product 
accountability, concomitant therapy use, Adverse Event documentation and reporting, and 
quality of data.  Sections of Case Report Forms may be collected on a visit-by-visit basis. 
 
12.3 Source document requirements 

According to the guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, the Monitoring Team must check 
the Case Report Form entries against the source documents, except for the pre-identified 
source data directly recorded in the Case Report Form.  The Informed Consent Form will 
include a statement by which the patient allows the Sponsor’s duly authorized personnel, 
the  Ethics  Committee  (IRB/IEC),  and  the  regulatory  authorities  to  have  direct  access  to 
source data which supports the data on the Case Report Forms (e.g.  patient's medical file, 
appointment  books,  original  laboratory  records,  etc.).    These  personnel,  bound  by

18. PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF THE STUDY OR PREMATURE 

CLOSEOUT OF A CENTRE 

18.1 Premature discontinuation of the study 

The Trial Management Committee (TMC) may discontinue the study if information on the 
Investigational  Product  causes  doubt  as  to  the  benefit/risk  ratio,  or  if  a  demonstrably 
superior treatment becomes available. 
 
18.1.1 Early stopping rules 

If,  after  accrual  of  50  patients  on  each  arm of  the  study,  there  are  5  or  more  treatment-
related  deaths  on  either  arm,  accrual  will  be  suspended  pending  detailed  review  of  the 
data.    If  no  apparent  correctable  causes  are  found,  then  the  TMC  will  consider  early 
termination of the trial.  (This rule is based on specifying 3% as the maximum acceptable 
treatment-related death rate in this group of patients, and determining that if 3% is the true 
rate, then the probability of observing 5 or more deaths is ≤0.05) 
 
The overall toxicity data will be periodically reviewed by the Independent Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee, which may recommend to the TMC suspension of the trial at any 
time. 
 
18.2 Premature closeout of a centre 

The TMC may closeout a centre if the Center’s conduct of the trial is not in accordance 
with the procedures defined in the approved protocol or trial agreement (e.g., low rate of 
recruiting, protocol deviations, or failure to ensure the quality of the data collected). 
 
An Investigator may withdraw at any time in which case he/she must notify the Sponsor of 
his/her decision and give the reason in writing.

In all cases, Ethics Committee(s) (IRB/IEC) and Health Authorities should be informed.   
 

19. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT 

The Sponsor will be responsible for preparing a Clinical Study Report. 
 

20. PUBLICATIONS 

It  is  the  policy  of  the  Sponsor  to  encourage  the  presentation  and/or  publication  of  the 
results of their studies, using only clean, checked and validated data in order to ensure the 
accuracy of the results.   
 
The analysis for publication will be performed by the TROG statistician in collaboration 
with  the  trial  statistician.    The  manuscript[s]  for  any  publication[s]  will  be  written  by 
TROG personnel with appropriate contributions by Sanofi-Synthelabo [but with no right 
of veto] and collaborating clinical investigators.  The Trial Management Committee will 
be  overall  responsible  for  presentations  and/or  publications.    The  Trial  Management 
Committee  must  send  a  copy  of  the  manuscript  or  abstract  to  the  Sponsor  for  review  at 
least  forty-five  (45)  days  before  submission,  and,  if  necessary,  delay  publication  or 
communication  for  a  limited  time,  not  to  exceed  90  days,  in  order  to  protect  the 
confidentiality or proprietary nature of any information contained therein. 
 
Authorship  of  publications  will  be  guided  by  the  Vancouver  Agreement  (51).    The 
Sponsor  may  request  that  the  Sponsor’s  name  and/or  names  of  one  or  several  of  its 
employees appear or not appear in such publications. 
 
All  study  participants  (Investigators  and  Committee  members)  give  full  authority  to  the 
Trial  Management  Committee  for  primary  presentation  and/or  primary  publication  of 
results.  No other publication is allowed before the primary publication.  Any subsequent 
presentation  or  publication  by  a  study  participant  must  be  approved  by  the  Trial 
Management Committee and make reference to the study and the primary publication. 
 

21. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 

All appendices attached hereto and referred to herein are made part of this protocol. 
 
No  changes  or  amendments  to  this  protocol  may  be  made  by  the  Investigator  or  by  the 
Sponsor  after  the  protocol  has  been  agreed  to  and  signed  by  both  parties  unless  such 
change(s)  or  amendment(s)  has/have  been  fully  discussed  and  agreed  upon  by  the 
Investigator and the Sponsor.  Any change agreed upon will be recorded in writing, the 
written amendment will be signed by the Investigator and by the Sponsor and the signed 
amendment will be filed with this protocol.

Amendments  are  required  to  be  approved  by  the  Trial  management  committee  and  the 
TROG Scientific Committee.  Any amendment to the protocol requires written approval / 
favorable opinion by the Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) prior to its implementation, unless 
there are overriding safety reasons. 
 
In some instances, an amendment may require  a change to the Informed Consent Form.  
The  Investigator  must  receive  an  IRB/IEC  approval  /  favorable  opinion  concerning  the 
revised Informed Consent Form prior to implementation of the change.

GRADE 
Adverse Event 
HEMORRHAGE 
Notes: Transfusion in this section refers to pRBC infusion 
In addition to grading severity by grading the site or type of bleeding grade 3 or 4 platelets (< 50.000), always grade Hemorrhage / bleeding 
with grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Also consider platelets, transfusion – pRBCS, and transfusion-platelets in addition to the grade that 
incorporates the site or type of bleeding. 
If the site or type of hemorrhage / bleeding is listed, also use the grading that incorporate the site of bleeding: CNS hemorrhage / bleeding, 
Hematuria, Hematemesis, Hemoptysis, Hemorrhage / bleeding with surgery, Melena / lower GI bleeding, Petechiae / purpura (Hemorrhage / 
bleeding into skin), Rectal bleeding / hematochezia, Vaginal bleeding. 
If the platelets count is ≥ 50.000 and the site or type of bleeding is listed, grade the specific site. If the site or type is not listed and the platelet 
count is ≥ 50.000 grade Hemorrhage / bleeding without grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and specify the site or type in the OTHER category. 
Hemorrhage / 
bleeding without 
grade3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia 
Platelets, Hemoglobin, Transfusion-platelets, Transfusion – pRBCs site or type of bleeding. If the site is not listed, grade as Hemorrhage –

Hemorrhage – Other (specify site_____) 
Note: Bleeding in the absence of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia is graded here only if the specific site or type of bleeding is not listed 
elsewhere in the HEMORRHAGE category. Also grade as Other in the HEMORRHAGE category.
