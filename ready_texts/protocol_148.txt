Introduction

Indication

1.1.
This trial will enroll patients with locally advanced, unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) other than predominantly squamous cell histology, who are treatment-naive, 
have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 (refer to 
Attachment 3), and have 10% weight loss in the preceding 3 months.
1.2. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world, both in terms of incidence (1.2 million 
new cases or 12.3% of the world total) and mortality (1.1 million deaths or 17.8% of the world 
total; Parkin 2001).  Most lung cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage (refer to 
Attachment 7 for the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] Staging System for Lung 
Cancer), conferring a poor prognosis.  In addition, most patients who develop lung cancer smoke 
and have smoking-related damage to the heart and lungs, making aggressive surgical or 
multimodality therapies less feasible options.  Non-small cell lung cancer constitutes 75% to 
80% of lung cancer cases, and one-third of these patients will present with Stage III disease 
(Yang et al. 2005).
1.3. Treatment of Locally Advanced, Unresectable, Stage III, Non-

Small Cell Lung Cancer

Depending on clinical circumstances, the principal forms of treatment that are considered for 
patients with locally advanced, inoperable or unresectable, Stage III NSCLC are radiation 
therapy (RT), chemotherapy, or combinations of these modalities.  Though most clinicians use a 
combination of a platinum-containing regimen and RT, no reference regimen for inoperable 
Stage III NSCLC has been established by randomized trials.
Prior to the recognition of the benefits of systemic chemotherapy for patients with metastatic 
NSCLC, the standard of care for patients with locally advanced unresectable or inoperable 
disease was RT.  A meta-analysis based on individual data from 3033 patients from 22 trials 
demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of combining chemotherapy with radiation for 
these patients (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group 1995).  The greatest difference 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 13

was seen in the 12 cisplatin-based trials involving 1780 patients.  The hazard ratio (HR) in favor 
of cisplatin 0.87 (p=0.005) corresponded to an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 4% at 
2 years, and 2% at 5 years.
A recent individual patient-based meta-analysis examined the role of chemotherapy given either 
sequentially or concomitantly with radiation compared to radiation alone (Rolland et al. 2007).  
A separate meta-analysis examined and compared the results of randomized trials of concomitant 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy (ChRT) with sequential chemotherapy and radiation 
(Auperin et al. 2007).
There were 4917 patients in the 31 trials examining sequential chemotherapy and radiation to 
radiation alone (Rolland et al. 2007).  Data were available from 22 trials comprising a total of 
3839 patients.  Sixteen trials used platinum-based regimens and 15 of the trials used a radiation 
dose below 60 Gy.  Combined modality therapy improved survival (HR=0.88; p<0.001), 
corresponding to an absolute benefit in survival of 2.7% at 3 years.  There was no detectable 
interaction between the timing of the administration of chemotherapy or the nature of the drugs 
used with survival.  There was a trend suggesting radiation doses of 60 Gy or higher were 
superior to studies using lower doses.
There were 3332 patients in 21 trials that examined concomitant ChRT to radiation alone with 
data available for analysis from 2910 patients in 16 trials.  Chemotherapy was administered daily 
or weekly in the majority of trials and only 308 patients did not receive a platinum agent.  
Concomitant therapy produced a survival advantage (HR=0.87; p<0.001), corresponding to an 
absolute increase in survival of 3.2% at 3 years and 1.2% at 5 years.  There was no evidence of 
benefit to subgroups based on timing of chemotherapy (daily, weekly, or other) or the addition of 
induction chemotherapy.  The most favorable hazard ratios were seen with platinum and 
etoposide combinations or with taxanes alone, but the numbers of patients were small and the 
results were not conclusive.
A separate analysis focused on examining trials comparing sequential chemotherapy and 
radiation with concomitant ChRT (Auperin et al. 2007).  Data from 6 trials encompassing a total 
of 1205 patients were assessed; 97% of patients had Stage IIIA or IIIB disease, with 97% having 
performance status of 0 or 1.  While there was no difference seen in pulmonary toxicity between 
the sequential and concomitant groups, the relative risk of Grade 3 or 4 esophagitis was higher in 
the group treated with concomitant therapy (relative risk [RR]=4.9; p<0.0001).  There was 
improved survival in the concomitant group (HR=0.84; p=0.004), translating to an absolute 
improvement in survival of 5.7% at 3 years.  Compared to the sequential group survival of 
10.6% at 5 years, the survival of 15.1% at 5 years in the concomitant group represented an 
absolute increase of 4.5%.  These benefits seem primarily attributable to a decrease in 
locoregional progression in the concomitant group, albeit at the expense of increased esophageal 
toxicity.
Current standards of chemotherapy given to patients with metastatic disease cannot be given at 
full doses safely with radical doses of thoracic radiation (Vokes et al. 2002).  It is possible to 
hypothesize that the lack of improvement in systemic control seen in the meta-analysis reported 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 14

by Auperin and colleagues (2007) may be either a reflection of the undertreatment of occult 
systemic disease by outdated regimens given at full dose or the use of standard chemotherapy 
regimens at suboptimal doses (Blackstock and Govindan 2007).
The conclusion arising from these efforts is that concurrent ChRT produces the highest cure rates 
as measured by 5-year survival, but does so at an increased level of toxicity.  This is entirely 
consistent with other authoritative reports (Pfister et al. 2004; Okawara et al. 2006; Rowell and 
O’Rourke 2007).
1.3.1. Current Standard of Care
While it is clear that concomitant ChRT produces improved survival for appropriately selected 
patients compared to sequentially administered chemotherapy and radiation, there have been no 
studies specifically addressing the question of the optimal chemotherapy regimen to be given 
with radiation.  The majority of information available supports the use of a platinum-based 
treatment program in this setting.
There are few randomized trials that have addressed the question of whether additional 
chemotherapy given outside the setting of the concomitant phase of therapy enhances the overall 
efficacy of the treatment.  The addition of full-dose chemotherapy before or after concomitant 
therapy, with the aim of reducing the burden of systemic micrometastases, may improve these 
results.
Current practice commonly consists of patients receiving induction chemotherapy prior to 
proceeding to concomitant therapy or consolidation chemotherapy given after concomitant 
therapy.  There is one randomized Phase 2 trial and one randomized Phase 3 trial that have 
examined the role of induction chemotherapy prior to concomitant therapy.
The randomized Phase 2 trial compared 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel and 
carboplatin followed by 63 Gy radiation with a similar 2 cycles of the same induction therapy 
followed by weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin given with 63 Gy radiation.  A third arm within 
this study allocated patients to immediate weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin and 63 Gy radiation 
followed by 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin (Belani et al. 
2005).  The most effective treatment observed was the immediate concomitant therapy arm, 
though this was associated with greater toxicity, notably esophagitis.  Vokes and colleagues 
(2007) randomized 366 patients to immediate concomitant ChRT with weekly paclitaxel and 
carboplatin to an arm in which the same therapy was preceded by 2 cycles of full-dose paclitaxel 
and carboplatin chemotherapy.  The addition of induction therapy did not improve the efficacy of 
treatment, and the efficacy parameters of the immediate concomitant arm were superior in terms 
of median and 2-year survival.
A randomized Phase 3 trial examined the role of single-agent docetaxel as consolidation therapy 
after chemotherapy with etoposide/cisplatin and concurrent thoracic RT.  The study was closed 
by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) before the target accrual had been reached, after the 
DMC concluded that the trial could not show a difference in favor of the more toxic docetaxel 
arm with the target accrual numbers.  In this study of 203 patients, consolidation docetaxel did 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 15

not improve survival and was associated with significant toxicity, including an increased rate of 
hospitalization and premature death.  Eighteen percent of patients assigned to docetaxel failed to 
receive the planned 3 cycles.  The Hoosier Oncology Group (HOG) concluded that docetaxel 
consolidation does not improve overall survival (OS) and should no longer be used for patients 
with unresectable Stage III NSCLC (Hanna et al. 2007).  However, these investigators postulated 
that one potential reason for failure of consolidation was inadequate delivery of therapy 
secondary to toxicity.  This shortcoming may be overcome with an effective less toxic alternative 
such as pemetrexed.
Despite these negative studies, there remains considerable uncertainty about the role of 
chemotherapy outside the concomitant phase of treatment, with many physicians unwilling to 
abandon more treatment in a potential curative setting when cure rates are already so low.
In attempting to identify an appropriate standard of care for the concomitant phase of therapy 
without the benefit of randomized trial data that compares chemotherapy regimens, data from 
Phase 2 trials were examined.  To date, the most promising regimen reported is the multicenter 
Phase 2 trial examining the SWOG 9504 regimen in patients with Stage IIIB disease (Gandara et 
al. 2003).  The investigators reported a median survival of 26 months and a 3-year survival of 
37% amongst the 83 eligible patients.  This trial used etoposide/cisplatin with radiation, followed 
by docetaxel consolidation.  As already noted, Hanna and colleagues (2007) found no benefit 
from the addition of docetaxel consolidation, which was associated with notable toxicity 
compared to the no consolidation arm.  The median survival in the docetaxel arm was 
21.5 months compared to 24.1 months in the arm without consolidation with 3-year survival 
rates of 27.2% and 27.6%, respectively.
The predecessor to the SWOG 9504 program was SWOG 9019, which used etoposide and 
cisplatin both with the radiation and as consolidation, and reported a median survival of 
15 months and 3-year survival of 17% in 50 eligible patients (Albain et al. 2002).  Considering 
the survival reported in the Hanna trial, while it is possible that consolidation therapy with 
etoposide/cisplatin is deleterious, it seems more likely that the differences in the improved 
median survival (reported by Hanna) were a consequence of patient selection due to stage 
migration resulting from PET scans used in their initial assessment of patients.
The SWOG 9019 regimen has been studied more completely in a randomized trial in which 
definitive ChRT was compared to preoperative concomitant therapy in patients with resectable 
Stage IIIA disease (Lung Intergroup Trial 0139; Albain et al. 2005).  Out of 429 patients 
randomized, 411 were eligible for analysis and showed a median survival of 21.7 months for the 
patients randomized to definitive ChRT with a 3-year survival of 33%.  The only toxicity that 
was significantly higher in the definitive ChRT arm was Grade 3/4 esophagitis.
Based on the cumulative information available, concomitant therapy with cisplatin and etoposide 
plus radiation is an appropriate treatment regimen for the concomitant phase of therapy, as this 
regimen has a known, predictable, and acceptable side effect profile.  Also based on limited 
information, the preferred order of administration appears to favor commencing therapy with 
concomitant ChRT and then adding consolidation treatment.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 16

There is no single consolidation treatment regimen that can be recommended, based on available 
data.  A number of consolidation therapies have been used following a program of combined 
ChRT and include additional etoposide and cisplatin (Albain et al. 2002, 2005), vinorelbine and 
cisplatin (Zatloukal et al. 2004; Fournel at al. 2005), paclitaxel and carboplatin (Belani et al. 
2005), docetaxel (Gandara et al. 2006), and paclitaxel (Davies et al. 2006).  When either taxane 
was used alone, excessive toxicity was noted, though the use of single-agent paclitaxel was in a 
poorer risk population.  Given the lack of consensus about a standard of consolidation treatment, 
this trial (JMIG) will permit investigation sites to select 1 of 3 platinum-based doublet regimens 
to be used as consolidation ChRT for the patients entered in the control arm:  etopside/cisplatin, 
or vinorelbine/cisplatin, or paclitaxel/carboplatin.
1.4. Pemetrexed
Pemetrexed (Alimta®, MTA, LY231514) is a multitargeted antifolate developed by Eli Lilly and 
Company (Lilly).  The compound has shown activity against a broad range of tumors in clinical 
development and is being tested in a variety of common, but poorly controlled, neoplasms to 
ascertain what its contribution will prove to be in cancer control.
1.4.1. Pemetrexed Development in Lung Cancer
Pemetrexed targets folate-dependent reactions that are essential for cell proliferation and thus 
interferes with the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines.  It is the first antifolate 
antimetabolite approved since the introduction of folic acid antagonists, methotrexate and 
aminopterin in the 1940s.  Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin was approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) on 04 February 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma (MPM).  Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin was also approved for use in 
the European Union (EU) for the treatment of MPM and as monotherapy in the second-line 
treatment of NSCLC.  Polyglutamated pemetrexed has high affinity for the enzyme thymidylate 
synthase and therefore directly interferes with pyrimidine biosynthesis.  In addition, the 
polyglutamyl form of pemetrexed inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARFT), 
an enzyme controlling a key step in the purine biosynthesis pathway.  It is this twin inhibitory 
activity of pemetrexed that earned it the designation of a multitargeted antifolate (MTA).  The 
recommended dose of pemetrexed is 500 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 
10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenous 
infusion administered 30 minutes after pemetrexed.
Pemetrexed received accelerated approval from FDA in July 2004 as monotherapy for the 
treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had progressed following 
prior systemic chemotherapy (Cohen et al. 2005).  This decision was based primarily on data 
from one multicenter, Phase 3, randomized trial in 571 patients comparing single-agent 
pemetrexed with single-agent docetaxel (Hanna et al. 2004).  A retrospective analysis of the 
Phase 3 trial of pemetrexed versus docetaxel showed a statistically significant longer toxicity-
free survival time for pemetrexed compared with docetaxel (Pujol et al. 2007).
A difference in the treatment effect of pemetrexed has now been consistently observed in three 
Phase 3 studies:  H3E-MC-JMEI (JMEI), H3E-MC-JMDB (JMDB), and H3E-MC-JMEN 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 17

(JMEN).  Retrospective analyses from the trial comparing pemetrexed with docetaxel in patients 
with previously treated advanced/metastatic NSCLC (JMEI; Peterson et al. 2007), and 
prospective analyses from the trial comparing pemetrexed and cisplatin with gemcitabine and 
cisplatin in chemonaive patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC (JMDB; Scagliotti et al. 
2008) have been performed comparing OS and progression-free survival (PFS) by histologic 
type (squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC).  In both these Phase 3 studies, statistically 
significant treatment-by-histology interactions were observed, with greater OS and PFS 
exhibited in patients treated with pemetrexed and having nonsquamous histology when 
compared to patients with squamous cell histology.  In addition, data from a third Phase 3 study 
(JMEN) support the findings observed in JMEI and JMDB, demonstrating a consistent 
treatment-by-histology effect for pemetrexed and confirming the benefit of pemetrexed in 
nonsquamous NSCLC (the detailed results of Study JMEN will be disclosed at an upcoming 
scientific meeting).  Together, the results of these studies provide supportive evidence for the 
efficacy of pemetrexed in NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology.  Therefore, 
the JMIG study population has been limited to patients with locally advanced NSCLC other than 
predominantly squamous cell histology.  This patient population includes adenocarcinoma, large 
cell carcinoma, and other NSCLC histologies (that is, those that do not clearly qualify as 
adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma); this population may also be 
described as “nonsquamous” NSCLC for ease of reference.
1.5. Rationale for Concurrent Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin and RT, 

Followed by Consolidation Therapy with Pemetrexed in Locally 
Advanced (Stage III) NSCLC

Phase I studies have shown that pemetrexed with carboplatin can be administered at full doses 
concurrently with radical doses of thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) without increasing the 
expected toxicity of this combined treatment (Lilly IB 2007; Seiwert et al. 2007) and, to date, 
this observation is also true with cisplatin (Brade et al. 2007; Gadjeel et al. 2008; Govindan et al. 
2008).  Further, pemetrexed has shown efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC, administered both as 
a single agent (Rusthoven et al. 1999; Clarke et al. 2002; Hanna et al. 2004) and in combination 
with cisplatin, comparable to contemporary platinum-based regimens (Shepherd et al. 2001; 
Scagliotti et al. 2008).
There are 12 ongoing trials examining the combination of pemetrexed and radiation in the 
management of patients with Stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC:  one uses single-agent pemetrexed; 
6 use pemetrexed with cisplatin and radiation; 4 use pemetrexed, carboplatin and radiation; and 
1 uses pemetrexed and radiation with either carboplatin or cisplatin.  While the only 
chemotherapy used in one trial is pemetrexed and carboplatin with radiation, 3 trials employ 
some form of induction chemotherapy.  Some style of consolidation therapy is used in 7 trials; 
3 using single-agent pemetrexed as consolidation.  One trial randomizes patients to either 
induction or consolidation chemotherapy.  None of the studies are sufficiently mature to analyze 
for efficacy results, and the majority continue to accrue patients.  However, one observation in 
these trials is that the doublet therapy of pemetrexed and cisplatin, which is as effective as one of 
the contemporary standards of care (Scagliotti et al. 2008), can be given with radical doses of 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 18

thoracic radiation to patients with locally advanced NSCLC.  A second observation is that the 
pemetrexed-based therapies can be given with acceptable levels of toxicity compared to 
contemporary chemotherapy regimens used concurrently with RT (Brade et al. 2007; Gadjeel et 
al. 2008; Govindan et al. 2008).  Gadjeel’s study has accrued 19 patients, of whom 17 have 
completed all 3 cycles of pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy given with 66 Gy of radiation and 
11 have completed this therapy at a dose of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2
given on Days 1, 22, and 43 of RT.  No dose reductions were required in these patients.  The 
randomized Phase 2 study of Govindan has accrued more than 100 patients and also found 
acceptable levels of toxicity with a core regimen of pemetrexed and carboplatin administered 
concurrently with radiation followed by 4 cycles of consolidation single-agent pemetrexed.
By the end of August 2007, approximately 200 patients had entered in these trials.  The number 
of serious adverse events (SAEs) reported by 31 July 2007 was 74, and the number of deaths 
while on therapy or within 30 days after completing therapy was 13.  Of these, 5 (2.5%) patient 
deaths were designated as probably or possibly study-drug related.
Given that the potential for cure exists in patients with Stage IIIA and IIIB disease, current 
practice is challenging and can lead to treatment-related deaths.  Using the initial SWOG 9019 
regimen in the Intergroup 0139 trial, 4 treatment-related deaths (2.1%) occurred amongst the 
194 patients on the definitive ChRT arm (Albain et al. 2005).  Grade 3/4 esophagitis was 
recorded in 44% of patients, and Grade 3 and 4 respiratory adverse events or pneumonia was 
recorded in 24%.  Other concurrent ChRT programs reported Grade 3/4 esophagitis rates in 4% 
to 26% of patients (Furuse et al. 1999; Curran et al. 2003; Huber et al. 2003; Zatloukal et al. 
2004; Fournel et al. 2005).
There is also the potential for late toxicities to develop in these 12 studies (noted above).  
However, the sponsor (Lilly) believes that sufficient time has elapsed to ensure that this will not 
be a major concern.  One of the toxicities of concern is radiation pneumonitis.  Of the 74 SAEs 
within the 12 studies, there are 3 cases of radiation pneumonitis reported.  All 3 patients are 
described as recovering.
The major challenges faced by these patients are relapse and progression of their NSCLC, which, 
after relapse, is incurable.  The fatal consequences resulting from a failed treatment, at this point 
in contemporary standards of care, far outweigh the consequences seen from any treatment 
program to date.  The safety findings from the pemetrexed plus radiation studies are within the 
range of toxicities observed with current therapies.  Additionally, the pemetrexed/cisplatin 
regimen can be administered at full systemic doses of chemotherapy with radiation and has been 
shown to be an effective regimen to treat NSCLC; particularly, in the nonsquamous population 
of patients (Scagliotti et al. 2008).  This provides the basis for determining if an effective 
chemotherapy regimen delivered at optimal doses can lead to enhanced efficacy.
More detailed information about the known benefits and risks of pemetrexed may be found in the 
Investigator's Brochure (IB; Lilly 2007).

Investigational Plan

3.1. Summary of Study Design
Study H3E-MC-JMIG (JMIG) is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial of patients 
with locally advanced, unresectable/inoperable, Stage III NSCLC other than predominantly 
squamous cell histology (nonsquamous) without malignant pleural/pericardial effusion.  
Approximately 600 patients will be randomized.  Randomization will be at a 1:1 ratio between 
the experimental arm (Arm A; pemetrexed, cisplatin, and concurrent TRT for 3 cycles, followed 
by consolidation pemetrexed for 4 cycles), and the control arm (Arm B; etoposide, cisplatin, and 
concurrent TRT for 2 cycles, followed by consolidation with cytotoxic platinum-based doublet 
regimen of choice [excluding pemetrexed] for a maximum of 2 cycles).  Concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy cycles are 21 days for Arm A, and 28 days for Arm B.
Patients will be evenly randomized to treatment arms using an Interactive Voice Response 
System (IVRS) at a central location.  The IVRS will assign patients to treatment arms according 
to a stratified method of randomization.  In other words, there will be a separate and independent 
randomization within each of 16 strata or subgroups, defined by all 16 combinations of values of 
the following prognostic factors:

 Baseline ECOG performance status (0 versus 1)
 Gender (female versus male)
 Stage of disease (IIIA versus IIIB)
 PET scan (yes versus no).

Note:  PET scanning stratification will be based on scans done for staging the extent of the 
patient’s disease.
There will be 1 formal planned interim safety analysis and 1 futility analysis conducted by an 
independent data monitoring committee (DMC).  The DMC consists of independent oncology 
and statistical experts whose primary responsibility is to assess the safety data when a minimum 
of 6 months have elapsed since the completion of both the concurrent and any consolidation 
therapy of at least 100 patients and to provide recommendations to the sponsor (Lilly) regarding 
whether the study should proceed as originally planned, be modified, or be discontinued for 
safety reasons or slow accrual.  All safety data collected at this time will be summarized for the 
safety interim.  This review will provide sufficient data for an accurate assessment of the safety, 
including toxicities such as radiation pneumonitis and esophageal complications.  In addition, the 
DMC members will receive periodic serious adverse events (SAEs) summaries 6 months after 
the start of the trial and every 4 months thereafter until the interim safety review.  If any safety 
signal is seen, the DMC members may want to meet earlier than the planned safety interim.  
Enrollment will continue during the safety interim period.  Subsequent to the interim safety 
review, the DMC will be provided with periodic SAE summaries at agreed-upon intervals.
The final analysis of OS will occur at a time so as to include at least 355 deaths, performed using 
a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  The treatment arms will be compared using the standard 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 21

(nonstratified) log-rank test.  Assuming the true OS hazard ratio is 0.74, there will be a minimum
of 80% statistical power for the log-rank test.
The primary analysis of OS will be performed for all randomized patients.  The primary null 
hypothesis is that there is no advantage in OS for the experimental arm (that is, a survival hazard 
ratio of 1.00).

3.2. Discussion of Design and Control
Concurrent ChRT is the accepted standard of care for most patients with unresectable Stage 
IIIA/IIIB NSCLC, but no standard chemotherapy regimen or schedule has yet been established.  
Cisplatin, combined with a third-generation agent, provides the greatest activity in advanced 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 22

NSCLC but, to date, no third-generation agent has been shown to be tolerable at full dose in 
combination with radiotherapy (RT) and cisplatin.  Pemetrexed/cisplatin has shown promising 
activity in the advanced disease setting, and full-dose pemetrexed combined with RT appears 
tolerable.
As already noted the benefits of chemotherapy outside the concurrent phase of treatment have 
not been established in Phase 3 trials.  This trial has chosen to adopt an approach in which 
patients allocated to the control treatment group will receive 2 cycles of consolidation platinum 
doublet chemotherapy following concurrent chemotherapy and radiation treatment for a total of 
4 cycles of platinum-based therapy.  This approach is consistent with guidelines from the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO; Pfister et al. 2004) and the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (2008), with 
both groups acknowledging the limitations of available information.
Study JMIG is a global, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial with 2 treatment arms.  
Patients who are chemonaive prior to concurrent ChRT and have a primary diagnosis of
nonsquamous cell, unresectable, locally advanced (Stage IIIA or IIIB ) NSCLC without 
malignant pleural/pericardial effusion will be enrolled.
The primary endpoint, OS, will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of death 
from any cause.  If a patient has not died at the time of the data inclusion cutoff date for the 
analysis, OS will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be still alive.  The median 
survival time (MST) in the control arm (Arm B) is anticipated to be approximately 18 months, 
with an improvement of 6 months anticipated in the experimental arm (Arm A).

4. Study Population

Inclusion Criteria

4.1.
Patients enrolled in this study should not be considered candidates for any therapy beyond 
that identified in this protocol unless disease progression is identified.
Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

[1] Present with histologically proven or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC that is 
defined as other than predominantly squamous cell histology (squamous cell 
and/or mixed small cell, non-small cell histology is not permitted)

[2] Stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC (without malignant pleural/pericardial effusion).  
The presence of pleural/pericardial fluid is presumed indicative of metastatic 
disease unless proven otherwise.
NOTE:  A pleural effusion fluid that is present on both a CT chest scan and 
routine chest x-ray requires a pleuracentesis to ensure the effusion is 
cytologically negative.  Patients with effusions that are exudates are excluded 
even if the effusions are cytologically negative.  Patients with effusions that 
are not visible on routine chest x-ray or are too small to be tapped safely may 
be entered on this study, provided the remaining inclusion/exclusion criteria 
are met.
Sites are encouraged to obtain tissue confirmation of mediastinal nodal 
involvement.  However, mediastinal nodal involvement can be declared 
present in situations where there is a mass of lymph nodes present in which 
the margins of these nodes are indistinct.  In situations where the nodes have 
distinct margins, the size of the shortest axis of at least 1 node must be 
2.0 cm (CT/MRI).  Cases in which the distinct nodes all have short axis of 
<2.0 cm must have pathologic confirmation of disease presence for patients to 
be declared eligible.
Patients with Stage IIIB NSCLC who have supraclavicular nodal involvement 
may be entered into this study.  However, patients with cervical nodes are not 
permitted.  The upper border of supraclavicular nodes must not extend above 
the upper border of the lateral end of the clavicle, extended medially.

[3] Have an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1
[4] Have tumor lesion measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in 

Solid Tumors (RECIST; Therasse et al. 2000) or evaluable disease on CT 
scan.  PET scans and ultrasounds should not be used for lesion measurements
[5] Have adequate pulmonary function defined as a forced expiratory volume in 

1 second (FEV1) >50% of predicted normal volume and the carbon monoxide 
lung diffusing capacity (DLCO) >40% of predicted normal value.  Patients for 
whom DLCO measurements are not available will be deemed to have 
adequate oxygen transfer if their resting capillary/arterial blood gas on room 
air reveals an oxygen pressure (pO2) >60 mmHg.

[17] Had prior thoracic radiation.  However, other prior radiotherapy is allowed.  
Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of the treatment prior to 
study enrollment.  Patients may not have received whole pelvis radiation or 
radiation to more than 25% of their bone marrow (Cristy and Eckermann 
1987)
Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 30 days prior to study 
treatment

[18] Patients whose radiation treatment plans are likely to encompass a volume of 
whole lung receiving 20 Gy in total (V20) of more than 35% of lung volume.  
In some circumstances the V20 can exceed 35% (see Section 5.2.1.1.6.7)

[19] Concurrent cancer from another primary site requiring treatment of any kind 

within the past 5 years.  Exemptions to this will be permitted on a case-by-
case basis after prior approval by the lead Lilly physician or designate if the 
investigator believes the patient’s risk of recurrence and death is very low.  
Curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of any 
origin is allowed.  Patients with recurrence of a previously resected lung 
cancer or who have a second primary lung cancer are ineligible.

[20] Are pregnant, breast feeding, or unwilling to use adequate contraception
[21] Patients with immune deficiency (for example, HIV positive)
[22] Are unable to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), other than an aspirin dose 1.3 grams per day, for at least 2 days 
(5 days for long-acting agents [for example, piroxicam]) before, during, and 
for at least 2 days after administration of pemetrexed

solely on conduction deficits demonstrated on audiogram may be entered into 
the study.

[26] Known hypersensitivity to pemetrexed, cisplatin, etoposide or any of the 

excipients in these medicinal products

[27] Had prior systemic chemotherapy for lung cancer.

4.2.1. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates
Exclusion Criteria [13], [14], [19], and [27] help in maintaining specificity of the patient 
population for both efficacy and safety analyses.  Exclusion Criterion [15] eliminates 
investigational drugs that cannot be mapped to a standard drug dictionary, or for which little data 
are known to analyze the potential relationship of adverse events or drug interactions.  Exclusion 
Criteria [16] through [18] and [21] through [26] provide for patient safety.  However, it is 
possible a patient with previously treated head and neck cancer who develops nonsquamous 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 26

NSCLC could be considered for the trial provided the risk of recurrence and death from the 
treated head and neck cancer was sufficiently low (Exclusion Criterion [19]) and the medical 
team is able to administer thoracic radiation to the NSCLC without overlap to prior radiation 
therapy for the head and neck region, if that had been used.  Exclusion Criterion [20] is necessary 
because the effects of pemetrexed on the developing fetus are not known.
4.3. Discontinuations

4.3.1. Discontinuation of Patients
The criteria for enrollment must be followed explicitly.  If a patient who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, that patient is discontinued from the study treatment 
and Lilly or its designee must be contacted.  Patient can be allowed to continue in the study in 
order to provide the follow-up data needed for the analysis of the entire intent-to-treat 
population.  An exception may be granted in rare circumstances where the patient has a serious 
or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective alternative therapy and, in the 
opinion of the investigator, is receiving benefit from study drug.  In these rare cases, the 
investigator must obtain documented approval from Lilly to allow the patient to continue to 
receive study drug.
In addition, patients will be discontinued from the study treatment in the following 
circumstances:



If Exclusion Criterion [20], or [23] through [24] is observed or develops after 
entry or enrollment.  In this case, the patient will be discontinued from study 
treatment at the next visit or sooner in the event of a safety exclusion criterion

 The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn.  If this decision is 

made because of an SAE or a clinically significant laboratory value, the study 
drug is to be discontinued and appropriate measures are to be taken.  Lilly or its 
designee is to be alerted immediately.  Refer to Section 6.3, Safety Evaluations

 The patient or patient’s attending physician requests that the patient be withdrawn 

from the study treatment

 The patient, for any reason, requires treatment with another therapeutic agent that 

has been demonstrated to be effective for treatment of the study indication.  In 
this case, discontinuation from study treatment occurs prior to introduction of the 
new agent

 The investigator or Lilly, for any reason, but considering the rights, safety and 
well-being of the patient(s) and in accordance with ICH/GCP Guidelines and 
local regulations, stops the study or stops the patient's participation in the study

 The patient has evidence of progressive disease (PD)
 The patient is noncompliant with study procedures
 The patient has had 2 dose reductions and experiences an adverse event that 

would cause a third dose reduction

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 27

 The patient cannot receive study treatment within 42 days of the beginning of the 

previous cycle, unless continuation is approved by Lilly

 The patient receives concomitant yellow fever vaccination.

Patients who discontinue the study treatment early will have post therapy follow-up procedures 
performed as shown in the Study Schedule (Attachment 1).
4.3.2. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study site participation may be discontinued if Lilly, the investigator, or the ethical review board 
(ERB) of the study site judges it necessary for any reason.
4.3.3. Discontinuation of the Study
The study may be discontinued at any time if Lilly judges it necessary for various legitimate 
medical or logistic/administrative reasons.

5. Treatment

5.1. Treatments Administered
This Phase 3 study involves a comparison of patients in Arm A receiving pemetrexed and 
cisplatin and concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) for three 21-day cycles, followed by 
four 21-day cycles with pemetrexed consolidation versus patients in Arm B receiving etoposide 
and cisplatin and concurrent TRT for two 28-day cycles, followed by consolidation with a 
cytotoxic platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimen of choice (refer to Section 5.1.2 below) 
for up to 2 cycles.
Patients should be seen prior to each cycle of chemotherapy (up to 4 working days) for clinical 
assessment unless the patient’s clinical state has changed, in which case the patient should be 
seen closer to the day of therapy.  After the commencement of protocol therapy, the 
prechemotherapy blood samples may be collected up to 2 working days prior to the scheduled 
treatment.
The chemotherapy should be delivered prior to the radiation therapy on the day of treatment.  If 
 Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity results, chemotherapy should be held for that week.  Please 
see Section 5.2.1.1.6.9 for specific guidance related to the management of esophagitis.  If 
treatment is held for side effects, chemotherapy should be held until resolution to less than or 
equal to the patient’s baseline value before resuming treatment at a reduced dose.  If the day of 
chemotherapy falls on a holiday, chemotherapy should be administered on the next full working 
day following the holiday (for example, if Day 8 dose falls on Thanksgiving or Good Friday, the 
next chemotherapy dose would be given on the subsequent first available work day), provided 
the above conditions have been met.  Etoposide doses that are missed during the weekly schedule 
concurrent with TRT are not to be made up, but these should be documented.  Every effort 
should be made to continue the TRT during the concurrent phase in an uninterrupted manner.  
Should a patient develop severe esophagitis necessitating interruption of chemotherapy, the TRT 
may continue, provided the investigator believes supportive care will enable the patient to 
complete this part of the therapy without excess risk.
5.1.1. Concurrent Phase
Chemotherapy should commence on the first day of TRT.  For patients allocated to Arm B, this 
means that the first day of treatment must start on Monday (see Section 5.1 for holiday-related 
exception).  For patients allocated to Arm A, chemotherapy and TRT can commence any day of 
the week.
Concurrent phase chemotherapy cycles can only be commenced if there is ongoing TRT.  In the 
event of chemotherapy delays, cycles that are scheduled to resume after the last fraction of TRT 
will be omitted and not considered a reason for patients to come off of the trial.
Table JMIG.1 shows the chemotherapy regimens for Arm A (pemetrexed/cisplatin), and Arm B 
(etoposide/cisplatin) for the concurrent phase.

5.1.2. Recovery Phase
Day 1 of the recovery period begins the day after the last dose of TRT.  Patients on Arm A 
should continue their scheduled folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation during this interval.  
The consolidation phase begins when the attending physician determines that the patient has 
recovered from the effects of the combined modality treatment sufficiently to begin 
chemotherapy.  Blood tests and imaging in the recovery phase should be done as close as 
possible to the anticipated commencement of consolidation chemotherapy.
5.1.3. Consolidation Phase
Table JMIG.2 shows the chemotherapy regimens for the consolidation phase for Arm A 
(pemetrexed), and Arm B (platinum-based doublets of choice).
If the patient is unable to initiate consolidation chemotherapy at the 3-week time-point following 
the last dose of TRT (the recovery period), the chemotherapy may be delayed up to an additional 
2 weeks.  If the chemotherapy cannot be given during this time interval, the patient will be 
considered off study treatment.
In the case of consolidation chemotherapy scheduled to commence the next week, for scheduling 
reasons (for example, etoposide/cisplatin therapy begins on Mondays) the 5-week time frame of 
the recovery period from the last dose of TRT may extend to the following week.
All patients in Arm A will be supplemented with oral folic acid daily and with intramuscular 
injection of vitamin B12 during the recovery period.  Patients must receive at least 5 days of folic 
acid prior to the commencement of consolidation chemotherapy.
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for explaining the correct use of the 
investigational agent(s) to the site personnel, verifying that instructions are followed properly, 
maintaining accurate records of study drug dispensing and collection, and returning all unused 
medication to Lilly or its designee at the end of the study.
Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a 
complaint or problem with the study drug so that the situation can be assessed.

a
There are 2 distinct phases of chemotherapy in this protocol:  concurrent with radiation and 
consolidation following radiation.
Patients may experience toxicities requiring chemotherapy dose reduction in either or both 
phases of the protocol.  Patients who require dose reductions for toxicity will not have their 
doses re-escalated with one possible exception.  Patients commencing consolidation therapy may 
receive full-dose chemotherapy with an agent used in the concurrent phase of treatment, 
provided the toxicity that necessitated the dose reduction has resolved to Grade 2 or less and if 
the investigator believes that the offending toxicity was primarily the result of radiation therapy.
Patients on Arm A will continue their daily oral folic acid and vitamin B12 injections every 
9 weeks until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed.
5.1.4. Postdiscontinuation Follow-Up
Patients will continue treatment until they require discontinuation for reason(s) cited in 
Section 4.3 of this document.  Each enrolled patient will have a postdiscontinuation follow-up 
period when the treatment period is completed.  Patients who discontinue the study treatment for 
reasons other than disease progression will be followed at regular intervals for tumor 
measurement, by the same method used at baseline and during the study treatment period 
indicated in the Study Schedule (Attachment 1), until objective disease progression based on 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 33

lesion measurements.  For patients considered tumor responders, a confirmation of tumor 
response (if a confirmation has not already been obtained) according to the RECIST guidelines 
(Attachment 4; Therasse et al. 2000) must be documented.
Once the patient has objective disease progression, the patient will be followed every 
90 days (14 days).
The date of first documented disease progression must be recorded on the eCRF, even if it occurs 
after the patient has started a new therapy.  Postdiscontinuation data to be collected will include 
the date of disease progression; documentation of any anticancer treatment patient has received, 
including the dates of any postdiscontinuation systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or surgical 
intervention; and the date of death.  Patients will be followed until death or study closure.
5.2. Materials and Supplies

5.2.1. Concurrent Phase
5.2.1.1. Pemetrexed/Cisplatin/Thoracic Radiation Therapy

5.2.1.1.1. Pemetrexed
For instructions on reconstitution and administration of pemetrexed, refer to the IB (Safe 
Handling and Administration) or to the Summary of Product Characteristics.
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country’s regulatory requirements.

5.2.1.1.2. Folic Acid
Folic acid will be obtained locally in one of the following options, with preference in order from 
option 1 to option 2:

1. 350 to 1000 µg folic acid.
2. A multivitamin containing folic acid in the range of 350 to 1000 µg (acceptable 

only if option 1 is not available).

Patients must take oral folic acid on a daily basis.  Folic acid supplementation should begin 
approximately 7 days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue daily 
during the full course of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed.  The first dose 
of pemetrexed will be delayed until the patient has taken folic acid for at least 5 daily doses of 
the 7-day period preceding the first dose of pemetrexed.  Subsequent doses will be delayed until 
the patient has taken folic acid for at least 14 of the 21 days before pemetrexed administration.

5.2.1.1.3. Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 (1000 μg) will be obtained locally and administered as an intramuscular injection in 
the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and once every 9 weeks thereafter until 3 weeks 
after the last dose of pemetrexed.  Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same 
day as pemetrexed.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 34

5.2.1.1.4. Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone, 4 mg or equivalent, will be obtained locally and taken by mouth twice daily 
(BID) on the day prior to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration to reduce 
the incidence and severity of skin reactions.  Dexamethasone may be given for reasons other than 
rash prophylaxis.  Higher or additional doses of dexamethasone are permitted for antiemetic 
prophylaxis.

5.2.1.1.5. Cisplatin
Cisplatin injection (Platinol-AQ) is supplied as a concentrate solution or lyophilized powder.  
Dilution should be carried out in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution.  Cisplatin therapy should 
be immediately preceded and followed by hydration procedures and administered according to 
local practice.
Cisplatin should be stored at controlled room temperature 15ºC to 25ºC (59ºF to 77ºF).  Do not 
refrigerate, and protect unopened vial from light.

5.2.1.1.6. Thoracic Radiation Therapy
Prior to inclusion of any patient on this study, the radiation oncologist will evaluate the thoracic 
CT scan in order to ensure that the treatment volumes are unlikely to significantly exceed the 
specified normal tissue constraints.
Patients in both treatment arms will receive concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) using a 
standardized 3-dimentional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique on a linear accelerator 
operating at beam energy of  6 MV.  The target total dose of TRT will be 66 Gy in 33 daily 
fractions of 2 Gy, prescribed at the International Commission on Radiation Units and 
Measurements (ICRU) 50 reference point, and given according to the recommendations of the 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Radiotherapy Group 
(Senan et al. 2004) and ICRU-50 (ICRU Report 50, 1993).
Weekly clinical assessments are required during the ChRT treatment.  While 66 Gy in 
33 fractions is the target dose of radiation, concern about patient tolerance discovered during 
treatment planning; for example, a V20 exceeding that recommended in the protocol may dictate 
that a lower dose be administered.  Doses ranging from 60 Gy in 30 fractions to 66 Gy in 
33 fractions will be deemed acceptable to test the efficacy of the treatment programs being 
studied.

5.2.1.1.6.1. Dose Specifications
Patients will receive treatment 5 days per week, in once daily fractions, 2 Gy per fraction, to a 
target dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions.  No field reductions will be permitted and the entire 
planning target volume (PTV) must be treated daily.  Radiotherapy commences on Day 1 of 
chemotherapy.  When both chemotherapy and radiation are administered at the same 
center/location, it is recommended that radiation should follow within 30 to 60 minutes of the 
completion of chemotherapy or post-cisplatin hydration.  When the radiotherapy is delivered at a 
separate location, logistic considerations may result in radiotherapy being delivered prior to the 
administration of chemotherapy or post-cisplatin hydration.  On days where TRT and/or 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 35

chemotherapy are delayed for administrative reasons (for example, holidays or weather), this will 
not be considered a protocol violation, provided the full planned dose of TRT is administered.  
Administrative omissions on days when platinum therapies were lost should be resumed as soon 
as possible.  Single-day omissions of etoposide due to holidays or weather do not need to be 
reinstated.
Normalization of the treatment plan will cover 95% of the PTV with the prescription dose.  The 
minimum PTV dose ideally should not fall below 93% of the prescription dose.  All radiation 
doses will be calculated with inhomogeneity corrections that take into account the density 
differences within the irradiated volume (that is, air in the lung and bone).  The maximum and 
minimum point doses (within the PTV) will be reported.
Investigation site personnel are encouraged to assist patients with activities aimed at 
discontinuing smoking.  All patients who smoke should be strongly advised to cease smoking 
during radiotherapy.

5.2.1.1.6.2. Variations of Dose Prescription
No deviation:   99% of the PTV receives at least 93% of the prescribed dose, and no volume 
>1 cm3 within the PTV receives > 110% of the prescribed dose, and no more than a contiguous 
volume of 1 cm3 outside the PTV receives a maximum of 110% of the prescribed dose, and V5 
is ≤65%.
Minor deviation:  Deviations of this magnitude are not desirable, but are acceptable. Between 
<99% but 95% of the PTV receives at least 93% of the prescribed dose, or a contiguous volume 
of >1 cm3 within the PTV receives > 110% but  115% of the prescribed dose, or a contiguous 
volume of >1cm3 outside the PTV receives > 110% but  115% of the prescribed dose, or V5 is 
>65% but ≤80%.
Major deviation:  Doses in this region are not acceptable.  < 95% of the PTV is covered by 93% 
of the prescribed dose, or a contiguous volume of >1 cm3 within the PTV receives >115% of the 
prescribed dose, or a contiguous volume of >1 cm3 outside the PTV receives 115% of the 
prescribed dose, or V5 >80%.

If a conventional (non-4D CT) treatment planning CT study is performed, the gross tumor 
volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), and planning target volume (PTV) will be defined 
on all slices (see definitions in Section 5.2.1.1.6.4).  Each patient will be positioned in an 
institutional specific immobilization device in the treatment position on a flat table.
Both target volumes (GTV, CTV), PTV, and normal organs will be outlined on all appropriate 
CT slices.  All planning CT scans should be performed in the treatment position using the same 
immobilization device for set-up as is used at the linear accelerator.  Conventional CT scans will 
be performed during quiet, uncoached respiration while the patient undertakes a normal 
respiration, using at least 5-mm slices through the entire target volume.  The whole thorax 
(cricoid to L2) should be covered using 1-cm slices in order to generate dose-volume 
histograms to be calculated of the lungs, spinal cord, heart, and esophagus.  Radiotherapy should 
commence within 2 weeks (±) 2 working days of the planning CT scan.
A treatment planning FDG-PET/CT scan (or FDG-PET alone) with the patient in the treatment 
position is encouraged for treatment planning.  Where a PET/CT is obtained in the treatment 
position, the CT from this study may be used as the planning CT scan.
Intravenous contrast during the planning CT is optional, provided that a recent diagnostic chest 
CT was done with contrast to delineate the major blood vessels.  If not, intravenous contrast 
should be given during the planning CT.  If contrast is used, the densities can be over-ridden or 
the contrast scan must be registered to a noncontrast scan for planning purposes.  Optimal 
immobilization is critical for this protocol in order to ensure reproducibility of the daily set-up.
The use of 4D CT scan and 4D radiation treatment planning is permitted.  Acceptable methods of 
accounting for tumor motion include:  design of the PTV to cover the excursion of the lung 
primary cancer and nodes during breathing such as an internal target volume (ITV) approach, a 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 37

maximum intensity projection (MIP) approach, automatic breath-hold (that is, Eleckta ABC 
device), or a gating approach (for example, Varian RPM system).

5.2.1.1.6.4. Treatment Planning/Target Volumes
Target Volumes will be defined in accordance with the ICRU Report #62 (1999).
The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) encompasses all identified tumor, identified by radiologic 
imaging, PET scan, bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy.  Mediastinal lymph nodes with a short 
axis 1.0 cm or pretreatment PET scan with standardized uptake values (SUV) >3 will be 
included in the GTV unless metastases have been shown to be absent using cytologic, histologic, 
or PET studies.  This volume(s) may be disjointed.  In the event of a collapsed lobe or lung 
segment, the use of PET to distinguish tumor from fluid/atelectasis is allowed (See 4D CT 
planning and use of ITV’s).
The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is defined to be the GTV plus a 0.5-cm to 1-cm margin, as 
appropriate, to account for microscopic tumor extension.  For patients with N2 disease, the CTV 
will include the ipsilateral hilus in the proximity of the tumor, even if this is radiologically 
normal.  When the hilus is normal, the lower pole of the ipsilateral hilus will be excluded if the 
primary tumor is located in the upper lobe and vice versa in the case of a tumor in the lower lobe.  
The CTV may be extended to include the entire ipsilateral hilum that is radiologically normal in 
cases where the location of the primary tumor makes this an appropriate consideration; for 
example, tumor in close proximity to the hilum.  Elective treatment of the mediastinum and 
supraclavicular fossae will not be done.
Planning Target Volume (PTV):  The appropriate clinical target volumes (described above) 
will be enlarged to allow for organ motion and day-to-day set-up variation to define the PTV.  
Typically the CTV is expanded by 1 cm in all directions (and 1.5 cm superiorly or inferiorly for 
tumors of the lower lobe or with significant respiratory excursion).  Tighter PTV margins may be 
allowed based on assessments of CTV motion using fluoroscopy and/or 4DCRT.  When a 4DCT 
scan is performed, a patient-specific ITV may be directly derived for planning and appropriate 
margins added in order to derive a CTV and PTV, respectively.  These determinations should be 
documented but are left to the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  This PTV will be 
used to define the treated volume.

5.2.1.1.6.5. Treatment Planning
Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT)
The PTV is to be treated with any combination of coplanar or noncoplanar 3D conformal fields 
shaped to deliver the specified dose while restricting the dose to the normal tissues.  The 
treatment plan used for each patient will be based on an analysis of the volumetric dose, 
including dose-volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the PTV and critical normal structures.  
Each field is to be treated daily.
Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)
The use of IMRT is permitted, provided that the institution has been credentialed by the 
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) for intrathoracic IMRT treatments or if the site has 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 38

documented experience as evidenced by peer-reviewed publications of thoracic IMRT studies.  
Each site wishing to use IMRT must have prior approval by the lead study radiation oncologist 
or his/her designee. Since the development of the initial protocol, the use of IMRT has become 
more widespread.  While recognizing the need to accommodate this reality in the trial, it is also 
necessary to maintain adequate oversight on the use of this method to maintain patient safety. 
Therefore, sites wishing to use IMRT on patients otherwise eligible for this trial who do not meet 
the current approval criteria for IMRT use will submit their IMRT radiation treatment plans to 
the RTOG for rapid review.  A site with 2 consecutive IMRT plans approved with no major 
deviations from the radiation treatment prescription parameters set forth in Section 5.2.1.1.6.2
and without exceeding critical tissue tolerances (Section 5.2.1.1.6.7) will be permitted to submit 
subsequent IMRT cases for review in the usual manner.  As IMRT results in a greater proportion 
of lung receiving radiation outside the PTV, it is strongly recommended to maintain the total 
lung V5 level at 60% or less.  V5 levels less than or equal to 65% will be scored as no deviation,
V5 levels above 65% but less than or equal to 80% scored as a minor deviation, and V5 levels 
above 80% scored as a major deviation.

5.2.1.1.6.6. Documentation
Centers participating in this study will perform heterogeneity corrections for all study treatment 
planning.  It is recognized that differences between calculation algorithms in the different 
treatment planning systems may result in dose variations for individual patients.  However, the 
clinical impact of this variation is likely to be limited when compared with other potential 
sources of variation that may arise in a multicenter trial, including interinstitutional and 
interclinician variations in contouring the GTV.  Information documenting the software used in 
the calculation algorithms will be collected.
Portal image of each field of 3DCRT or orthogonal images that localize the isocenter placement 
of IMRT must be obtained on the first day of therapy in accordance with standard department 
protocols but will not be submitted.  The films should be compared to localization films and 
discrepancies corrected.
Dose volume histograms will be generated for PTV, both lungs, lungs minus PTV, spinal cord, 
esophagus, and heart.  The following dose values should be recorded:

prescription point dose


 minimum, maximum, and mean dose in PTV
 maximum dose to spinal cord
 V20 and V5.

5.2.1.1.6.7. Organs at Risk
Normal tissue constraints shall be prioritized in the following order for treatment planning:

1 = spinal cord, 2 = lungs, 3 = heart, 4 = esophagus, and 5 = brachial plexus

Spinal cord:  The spinal canal will be contoured and taken to represent the spinal cord.  The 
maximum cord dose will be limited to 46 Gy.  Patients who receive up to 48 Gy will be counted 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 39

as a minor deviation.  All patients who receive more than 48 Gy will be counted as a major 
deviation.  If, after patient enrollment, it is discovered the total tumor dose has to be limited to 
stay within normal tissue dose constraints and falls below 60 Gy in 30 fractions, the treated 
patients will be eligible for toxicity evaluation, but additional patients will be recruited to ensure 
the appropriate number of patients are treated at the prescribed dose of radiation.
Lungs:  The dose-volume constraint to the lungs is the second highest priority and must be met, 
except if it conflicts with spinal cord dose constraints.  The volume of both lungs (total lung 
volume minus PTV) that receive more than 20 Gy (V20) should not exceed 35%.  V20s up to 
38% will be permitted and viewed as a minor deviation, provided the treating radiation 
oncologist believes this level of exposure is within patient tolerance.
Heart:  The heart will be contoured on all slices.  The cranial border will include the 
infundibulum of the right ventricle and the apex of both atria and exclude the great vessels as 
much as possible.  The caudal border is defined as the lowest part of the left ventricle that is 
distinguishable from the liver.  A recent report provides more detailed guidance for contouring 
the heart excluding the great vessels (Feng et al. 2011).  The following limits are recommended:  
60 Gy < 1/3; 45 Gy < 2/3; and 40 Gy < 100% of the heart.
Esophagus:  Esophagitis is an expected side effect of concurrent therapy programs.  This 
protocol will examine the relationship of toxicity with higher doses of radiation which 
encompass the entire esophageal circumference.  The outer wall of the esophagus will be 
contoured completely throughout the length of esophagus that is encompassed by a dose of 
radiation 46 Gy.
Brachial Plexus:  Brachial plexus doses should be kept under 66 Gy.  Patients who are believed 
to be at risk for brachial plexus injury with a dose of 66 Gy may be entered into this study, 
provided the planned administered dose is above 60 Gy.
Toxicities documented during radiation therapy will be recorded using the Common 
Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 (National Cancer Institute [NCI] 
2006) scale.  Toxicities arising more than 90 days since the completion of radiation therapy and 
attributed to radiation will be assessed according to CTCAE criteria and counted as late radiation 
toxicities.  As both arms use consolidation therapy, the toxicities encountered during these 
treatments and during the 30-day follow-up period will not be declared late radiation toxicities 
unless the events are confined to tissue within the radiation treatment volume.

5.2.1.1.6.8. Treatment Quality Assurance and Compliance with Protocol-Defined 

Radiation Prescription (Quality Control)

The sponsor (Lilly) plans to perform post hoc validation of the radiation treatment planning 
simulations.  This will address the quality control issues necessary to assure the validity of the 
primary analysis, and to permit an assessment of radiation compliance as defined in the protocol.
The sponsor will evaluate investigational sites using a mock case (‘dummy-run’) before 
enrollment of the first patient.  The sponsor will perform real-time review of the radiation 
prescription of the first entered patient to ensure radiation prescription is compliant with the 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 40

protocol requirements.  Once each site has had a real-time case approved without modification 
by central review, a 20% real-time random sample of subsequent cases will be reviewed.  This 
should be sufficient to ensure adherence to the radiation prescription defined in the protocol.  
These patients will commence protocol therapy without delay but may have their radiation field 
altered based on information obtained from the quality review.  All patients will have their 
radiation records reviewed, either in real time or at the completion of the study, to correlate the 
degree of local control and toxicity with adherence to the protocol radiation prescription.

5.2.1.1.6.9. Radiation Adverse Events and Interruption
The investigators will be advised to suspend the use of chemotherapy given with radiation if they 
believe that continuing chemotherapy administration will compromise delivery of full-dose 
radiation in an uninterrupted manner.
Reversible or permanent alopecia, bone marrow toxicity, skin pigmentation, and esophagitis are 
expected side effects of radiation therapy.  Radiation-induced myocarditis or transverse myelitis 
rarely occur at doses lower than 50 Gy.  Radiographic evidence of radiation-induced changes and 
subsequent fibrosis of the lung may occur within lung volumes receiving 20 Gy.  It is essential 
to spare as much normal lung as possible in order to avoid symptomatic lung injury.
Esophagitis
The first symptoms of acute esophagitis usually start in the second or third week of TRT, 
commonly at the dose of 18.0 to 21.0 Gy of standard fractionated RT (Wei et al. 2006), and 
include a sensation of difficult swallowing (dysphagia).  This may progress to painful 
swallowing of food and saliva (odynophagia) and later to constant pain not necessarily related to 
swallowing.  In severe cases, patients may not be able to swallow at all and may require 
intravenous hydration, feeding through a gastric tube and, in rare cases, parenteral nutrition.
Esophagitis complaints are common with combined modality therapy (Werner-Wasik et al. 
2002).  Esophagitis does not constitute a reason to interrupt or delay radiotherapy or 
chemotherapy, provided oral intake is sufficient to maintain hydration.  Patients should be 
advised to avoid alcoholic beverages and acidic or spicy foods and beverages.  Acute esophagitis 
symptoms may persist for 1 to 3 weeks after completion of RT.  If CTCAE Grade 4 esophagitis 
occurs and treatment is interrupted, every effort should be made to limit the interruption to 3 
treatment days or less.  Patients requiring hospitalization, placement of a feeding tube in the 
stomach, or intravenous feedings because of esophagitis may have their treatment interrupted in 
order to allow for healing of the esophageal lining.
Table JMIG.3 lists esophagitis grading and clinical states according to the CTCAE version 3.0.

5.2.1.2. Etoposide/Cisplatin/Radiation Therapy

5.2.1.2.1. Etoposide
Etoposide (etoposide phosphate, Eposin, Etopophos, VePesid, VP-16) is given by 
intravenous infusion per local practice guidelines slowly over a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes.  

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 42

Blood pressure is checked often during infusing, with the speed of administration adjusted 
accordingly.
Etoposide is supplied either as individual vials containing etoposide phosphate powder 
equivalent to 100 mg etoposide or concentrate for injection 20 mg/mL.  Prior to use, the content 
of each vial must be reconstituted and further diluted with sterile water containing 0.9% sodium 
chloride or 5% dextrose to final concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 mg/mL.  The diluted solution should 
be inspected visually for discoloration and particulate matter prior to administration.  
Investigational sites must not store any unused portion of a vial for future use, and must discard 
unused portions of product.
All materials including needles, syringes, vials, and other materials that have come into contact 
with etoposide should be separated and destroyed in accordance with local regulations.  
Unused/unopened vials may be returned to the manufacturer for disposal.  These materials 
should be appropriately packaged prior to their transport.
Etoposide should not be mixed with other antineoplastics or come into contact with aqueous 
buffers whose pH is above 8.
Unopened vials of etoposide phosphate should be stored at controlled room temperature 15ºC to 
25ºC (59ºF to 77ºF) in the original package to protect from light.

5.2.2.2.2. Vinorelbine/Cisplatin
Vinorelbine (vinorelbine tartrate, Navelbine) is administered by intravenous infusion over 
6 to10 minutes per local practice guidelines.  Each vial contains vinorelbine tartrate equivalent to 
10 mg (1-mL vial) or 50 mg (5-mL vial) vinorelbine in water for injection.  Vinorelbine injection 
must be diluted in either a syringe or iv bag using one of the recommended solutions (5% 
dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride solution).  Diluted vinorelbine may be used for up to 24 hours 
under normal room light when stored in polypropylene syringes or PVC bags at 5ºC to 30ºC

(41ºF to 86ºF).  Unopened vials are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored 
under refrigeration at 2ºC to 8ºC (36ºFto 46ºF) and protected from light in the carton.  Do not 
freeze.
Refer to Section 5.2.1.1.5 for cisplatin information.

5.2.2.2.3. Paclitaxel/Carboplatin
Paclitaxel (paclitaxel injection, Onxol, Taxol) is administered by intravenous infusion over 
3 hours per local practice guidelines.  All patients receiving this regimen should be premedicated 
at least 30 minutes prior to paclitaxel administration.  Premedication consisting of 
diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg, an H2-blocker, and dexamethasone is given in order to 
prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions.
Carboplatin (Paraplatin) is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes with standard 
antiemetics per local practice guidelines after paclitaxel.  Carboplatin dosing, using the Calvert 
formula, is often based upon a calculated creatinine clearance using serum creatinine as a 
surrogate for renal function.  Several assays are available to measure serum creatinine.  In the 
United States (US) and many parts of the world, most laboratories use methods that are 
standardized against reference material in which the creatinine value has been assigned by 
Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS).  After 31 December 2010, all clinical laboratories 
in the US, and some laboratories in countries outside the US (OUS), will use creatinine methods 
standardized relative to the IDMS reference material.
The recalibration of serum creatinine measurements against the IDMS reference material may 
result in slight differences in reported serum creatinine levels in the low range of normal.  
Consequently, measurement of serum creatinine relative to the IDMS standard could result in an 
overestimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in some patients with normal renal function.  
If the total carboplatin dose is calculated based on an estimated GFR using an IDMS-
standardized serum creatinine and the Calvert formula, carboplatin dosing could be higher than if 
the GFR had been directly measured, and could result in increased toxicity.
At sites where creatinine is determined by a method standardized to the IDMS reference 
material, the estimated GFR used in the Calvert formula to calculate area under the curve 
(AUC)-based dosing should not exceed 125 mL/min for patients who have not begun therapy.  
After 31 December 2010, all US sites and any other OUS site where the IDMS method is 
available should calculate carboplatin doses based upon serum creatinine values that were 
measured by the IDMS method.  At sites where the IDMS method is not available, for the 
estimated GFR used to calculate the Calvert formula, sites should continue to utilize the method 
that has been used in the conduct of the current study, or other trial specific directive if provided 
by Lilly.
The site is responsible to consult the local lab to determine what method of serum creatinine 
measurement is used by that laboratory.
The carboplatin dose will be calculated as the target AUC = 6 mg/ml x min, using the Calvert 
formula (Calvert et al. 1989; Attachment 6).

5.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
A computerized, interactive, voice-activated response system (IVRS) at a central location will 
control random assignment for all study sites.  The IVRS will assign patients to treatment arms 
according to a stratified method of randomization.  There will be a separate and independent 
randomization within each of 16 strata or subgroups, defined by all 16 combinations of values of 
the following prognostic factors:

 Baseline ECOG performance status (0 versus 1)
 Gender (female versus male)
 Stage of disease (IIIA versus IIIB)
 PET scan (yes versus no).

5.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study
Recent completed studies have demonstrated pemetrexed-platinum doublets perform with the 
same degree of efficacy as current standards of care for chemonaive patients with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC (Shepherd et al. 2001; Scagliotti et al. 2005, 2008; Zinner et al. 2005).  
Ongoing studies in patients with locally advanced NSCLC have shown that pemetrexed-platinum 
doublets can be given at full systemic doses when delivered concurrently with radical doses of 
TRT, something that cannot be done with contemporary chemotherapy regimens (Brade et al. 
2007; Gadjeel et al. 2008; Govindan et al. 2008).
Pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 combined with cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/ m2 was selected 
for Arm A for the present study based on the established efficacy of this regimen in advanced 
disease (Scagliotti et al. 2008) and the ability to deliver this therapy concurrently with radical 
doses of TRT (Gadjeel et al. 2008).
The dose and dose schedule of the combination of etoposide plus cisplatin and concurrent TRT 
were selected based on the trial reports of a number of investigators (Albain et al. 2002; Gandara 
et al. 2003; Hanna et al. 2007).
Consolidation treatment regimens are based on the etoposide regimen reported by Albain and 
colleagues (2002) or represent common treatment programs for metastatic disease.  Single-agent 
pemetrexed, as used in the consolidation arm, has been used as single-agent therapy for relapsed 
NSCLC (Hanna et al. 2004), and has been tested as maintenance therapy following initial 
treatment for metastatic NSCLC (Ciuleanu et al. 2008).  Four cycles of consolidation pemetrexed 
has been used following combined modality therapy for locally advanced NSCLC (Govindan et 
al. 2008).
5.4.1. Dose Delays/Dose Modifications
5.4.1.1. Concurrent Phase
For either treatment program, it is possible abnormal liver function tests may arise as a result of 
radiation to the liver, as could occur with malignancies involving the lower part of the right lung.  
If the investigator believes abnormal bilirubin or transaminase elevations are due to radiation and 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 45

not due to drug effects and that no dose modifications are necessary, continued full-dose 
chemotherapy may proceed only after prior agreement by either the principal systemic therapy 
investigator or his/her designee.

5.4.1.1.1. Pemetrexed/Cisplatin
Before starting a new cycle of treatment, the creatinine clearance of the patient must be 45 
mL/minute.  The cycle can be postponed up to 42 days from the last pemetrexed dose to allow 
the patient to recover from the toxic effects.  If the creatinine clearance has not recovered to 
45 mL/min counting 42 days from the last administered dose, then the patient must be 
withdrawn from the study therapy.
During the concurrent treatment, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 are 
administered intravenously on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.  Dose adjustments at the start of a 
subsequent cycle of study treatment will be based on nadir (lowest value) platelet and absolute 
neutrophil counts (ANC) from the preceding cycle of therapy.  Prior to treatment, ANC must be 
1.5  109 cells/L, and platelets must be 100  109 cells/L.  Treatment may be delayed to allow 
sufficient time for recovery.  Upon recovery, treatment should be administered according to the 
guidelines in Table JMIG.5 through Table JMIG.7 for hematologic, nonhematologic toxicities, 
and neurotoxicity, respectively.
In all circumstances, a delay in cisplatin will necessitate a delay in the administration of 
pemetrexed.  Delays are permissible to permit recovery of hematologic and renal function.  
While the usual procedure to permit a 1-week delay for recovery will be maintained, this 
protocol stipulates the principal systemic therapy investigator or his/her designee be notified if 
the recovery is insufficient to resume therapy after 1 week.  This is being done to ensure 
adequate oversight for this treatment program.

Nonhematologic Toxicity
In general, for nonhematologic toxicities greater than or equal to Grade 3, treatment should be 
delayed until resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s baseline value before resuming 
treatment at a reduced dose.  However, exceptions may be made for Grade 3 neurotoxicity or 
esophagitis.  In the case of neurotoxicity, the investigator and patient may decide to continue 
treatment at a reduced dose, with no delay required, as neurotoxicity may not resolve to baseline 
values. Adjustments for esophagitis should follow dose modifications as described in 
Table JMIG.9.

5.4.1.1.3. Radiation Treatment Interruptions









In case of interruptions due to machine breakdown or public holidays or any 
interruptions of therapy up to 7 days, radiation should be completed to the 
prescribed doses.  Total number of fractions and elapsed days should be carefully 
reported.
If an interruption of therapy is more than 7 days due to intercurrent illness, patient 
will be removed from the study and treated at the discretion of the investigator.
In the case of Grade 3 esophagitis related to the concomitant treatment, 
chemotherapy should be suspended if the investigator believes continued use will 
jeopardize the delivery of full-dose TRT, radiation is to be continued.  
Commencement of consolidation chemotherapy is permitted if there is resolution 
of the esophagitis to  Grade 2 within 5 weeks of the completion of TRT.
In case of Grade 3 radiation pneumonitis/lung infiltrates related to TRT, the entire 
treatment of the protocol is to be discontinued.

5.4.1.2. Consolidation Phase
To begin consolidation chemotherapy all previous nonhematologic toxicities, excluding 
neuropathy, must resolve to CTCAE Grade 2 or less.  Specific dose reductions for hematologic 
toxicities are noted for each consolidation treatment regimen.  A complete blood count (CBC) 
should be checked weekly while on study treatment.
Toxicities that cannot be attributed to radiation therapy (for example, myelosuppression, renal, or 
neurologic) and that led to dose reductions during the concurrent phase of the treatment program 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 52

will be carried over into the consolidation phase.  Other toxicities that are, in part, attributable to 
radiation and which led to dose reductions during the concurrent phase of therapy, will not be 
carried over to the consolidation phase provided the toxicity has recovered to  Grade 2.
For Grade 4 toxicity during the first cycle of consolidation chemotherapy, including febrile 
neutropenia, dose should be reduced by 25% and chemotherapy resumed when all toxicities have 
returned to Grade 2 or less.  If chemotherapy is held more than 3 weeks from the scheduled 
course of therapy, the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.

5.4.1.2.1. Pemetrexed

5.4.1.2.1.1. Hematologic Toxicities
The investigators will adjust doses of pemetrexed in a given cycle of therapy on the basis of 
nadir neutrophil and platelet counts from the preceding cycle.  Prior to the start of any cycle of 
chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following:  ANC 1.5 x 109/L; and platelets 
100 x 109/L; and creatinine clearance 45 mL/min.  Treatment may be delayed to allow 
sufficient time for recovery.  Upon recovery, patients should be re-treated using the guidelines in 
Table JMIG.11.

For nonhematologic toxicities considered related to pemetrexed  CTCAE Grade 3 (with the 
exceptions of CTCAE Grade 3 ALT or AST elevation, nausea, and vomiting), pemetrexed 
treatment should be delayed until resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s baseline value 
by the start of the cycle before proceeding.  Upon resolution, pemetrexed treatment will resume 
using the guidelines in Table JMIG.12.

weekends, bad weather, or other unforeseen circumstances.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 59

For the concurrent phase for patients on treatment Arm A, the definition of a cycle is 1 dose of 
pemetrexed plus 1 dose of cisplatin administered on Day 1 every 21 days.  For patients on 
treatment Arm B, the definition of a cycle is etoposide administered on Day 1 through Day 5 
plus 1 dose of cisplatin administered on Day 1 and Day 8 every 28 days.
During the consolidation phase, one cycle of therapy is defined as a 21-day period for Arm A 
(pemetrexed) and will continue up to 4 cycles.  For Arm B (platinum-based doublets of choice) 
the treatment will be administered up to maximum of 2 cycles.  The definition of a cycle is 
dependent upon the choice of the platinum-based doublet regimen.  Refer to Section 5.1.2 for the 
cycle length of each platinum-based doublet.
5.5.1. Special Treatment Considerations
Treatment may be delayed to allow a patient sufficient time to recover from study-drug-related 
toxicity.  A patient who cannot be administered study chemotherapy for an interval equal to or 
greater than 1 course of that regimen must be discontinued from study treatment, unless 
continuation is approved by Lilly.
Any patient who has had 2 dose reductions and who experiences a toxicity that would cause a 
third dose reduction must be discontinued from study treatment.
5.5.1.1. Clinically Significant Effusions
If a patient develops clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions (on the basis of 
symptoms or clinical examination) prior to the first dose of study treatment or during therapy, 
draining the effusion prior to dosing is required.  However, if the investigator determines that the 
effusion represents disease progression, the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.
5.5.1.2. Creatinine Clearance
Enrollment and dosing decisions should be based on calculated CrCl using the standard 
Cockcroft and Gault formula (Cockcroft and Gault 1976; see Attachment 5).
Local laboratory values used for serum creatinine may be used to calculate CrCl for enrollment 
or dosing decisions; however, if local laboratories are used to calculate CrCl, the same local 
laboratory must be used throughout the study.  In addition, a separate serum specimen must be 
collected before the initiation of treatment and whenever subsequent samples are collected for 
dosing decisions.  These additional samples will be sent to a central laboratory and used for 
subsequent safety analyses.  See Section 5.2.2.2.3 for details regarding the measurement of 
serum creatinine to calculate the carboplatin dose.
The CrCl should be 45 mL/min prior to the start of any cycle.  If a patient’s CrCl has not 
returned to 45 mL/min within 42 days after the last study therapy administration, the patient 
must be discontinued from the study treatment unless continuation is approved by Lilly.
5.5.1.3. Treatment Delays for Arm A Due to Insufficient Folic Acid or Vitamin B12

Supplementation

The first dose of study drug should be delayed until the patient has taken folic acid for at least 5 
of the 7 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1 and until the vitamin B12 injection has been administered.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 60

Subsequent doses should be delayed until the patient has taken folic acid for at least 14 of the 
21 days before Day 1 of the cycle.
5.6. Blinding
This is an open-label study.  Each patient will be aware of his/her own assigned treatment group.  
At each investigative site, all site personnel involved in treating and caring for study patients will 
have full knowledge of treatment assignment for those patients under their care.
5.7. Concomitant Therapy
Patients are allowed to receive full supportive-care therapies during the study, including 
hormone-replacement therapy.  Patients may receive nutritional support and undergo 
interventions such as esophageal dilatation.  Placement of gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) for non-
oral feeding should be considered in patients at high risk for chronic undernourishment because 
of severe swallowing impairment.  No other anticancer therapy, immunotherapy (for example, 
trastuzumab), hormonal cancer therapy, or experimental medications will be permitted while 
patients are participating in this study.  Any PD requiring other forms of specific antitumor 
therapy will be cause for discontinuation of study therapy.  Section 5.7.1 through Section 5.7.7
provides a discussion of the concomitant therapies that warrant special attention.
5.7.1. Colony-Stimulating Factors
Routine use of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) is not permitted during this study.  The ASCO 
guidelines for use of CSF should be followed (Smith et al. 2006).  Granulocyte or granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF/GM-CSF) may be used for patients who have 
ANC <0.5  109 cells/L, neutropenic fever, or documented infections while neutropenic.  
Duration of uncomplicated neutropenia before initiation of G-CSF treatment is left to the 
investigator’s discretion.  G-CSF must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to the start of the 
next cycle of chemotherapy.  Use of erythropoietin is allowed.
NOTE:  G-CSF is contraindicated during radiotherapy to the chest due to increased rate of 
complications and death (ESMO 2007).
5.7.2. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
Patients should not take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 2 days before, on 
the day of, and for 2 days following pemetrexed administration.  If a patient is taking an NSAID 
with a longer half-life (for example, naproxen, piroxicam, diflunisal, or nabumetone), the 
concomitant administration with pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 5 days prior to, on the 
day, and at least 2 days after receiving pemetrexed administration.  Concurrent use of aspirin is 
allowed, up to a maximum dose of 1.3 grams per day.
5.7.3. Leucovorin
Because folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation has reduced the number of episodes of 
CTCAE Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events associated with pemetrexed therapy, the sponsor 
does not anticipate the need for leucovorin as a rescue agent.  However, this section provides 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 61

information on leucovorin rescue if clinically needed.  The protocol allows leucovorin rescue in 
any of the following circumstances:

 CTCAE Grade 4 leucopenia lasting longer than 3 days
 CTCAE Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 3 days




immediately for CTCAE Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
immediately for bleeding associated with CTCAE Grade 3 thrombocytopenia
immediately for CTCAE Grade 3 or CTCAE Grade 4 mucositis.

The following doses and schedules are recommended for intravenous use:




leucovorin, 100 mg/m2 iv once; followed by
leucovorin, 50 mg/m2 iv every 6 hours for 8 days.

The investigator also may use appropriate doses of the oral formulation at his or her discretion.
5.7.4. Therapy for Diarrhea
In the event of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed:  
hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or severe 
(Grade 3 or 4) neutropenia, broad-spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed.  Patients with severe 
diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting must be hospitalized for 
intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances.
5.7.5. Therapy for Febrile Neutropenia
Patients experiencing febrile neutropenia, especially with diarrhea or dyspnea, should be 
managed in a hospital setting according to standard procedures, with the urgent initiation of 
intravenous antibiotic therapy.
5.7.6. Antiemetic Therapy
Nausea and/or vomiting should be controlled with adequate antiemetics.  The protocol allows 
patients to receive antiemetic therapy at the investigator’s discretion.  Antiemetic therapy should 
be administered according to standard local practice.
With the use of dexamethasone, single-agent pemetrexed is considered to have only mild to 
moderate emetic potential.
5.7.7. Drug-Drug Interactions
Pemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally as a result of tubular secretion and 
glomerular filtration.  Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (for example, 
aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporine) could result in delayed 
clearance of pemetrexed.  This combination should be used with caution.  Creatinine clearance 
should be closely monitored.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 62

Concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (for example, 
probenecid, penicillin) could also potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed.
5.7.8. Pleural Effusion
Patients who develop the presence of transudate fluid accumulations in third spaces; for example, 
ascites or pleural effusion, which can be detected clinically (during physical examination), and 
which cannot be adequately controlled by drainage or other procedures will be discontinued from 
study treatment.
5.8. Treatment Compliance
For Arm A, vitamin B12 supplementation will be administered as an intramuscular injection at 
the investigational sites.  As a result, patient compliance is ensured.  In the period before the first 
dose of study therapy, compliance with folic acid supplementation is required and should be 
documented by the investigative site personnel.  Sections 5.2.1.1.2 through 5.2.1.1.3 provide 
definitions of sufficient folic acid and vitamin B12 therapy.

6. Efficacy, Patient-Reported Outcome Measures, Safety 

Evaluations, Sample Collection, and Testing and 

Appropriateness of Measurements

Study procedures and their timing (including tolerance limits for timing) are summarized in the 
Study Schedule (Attachment 1).  Sites will assess tumor response in patients by using Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST; Attachment 4).
6.1. Efficacy Measures

6.1.1. Primary Efficacy Measure
The primary endpoint in this study is overall survival (OS).
Overall survival is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from 
any cause.  For each patient who is not known to have died as of the data inclusion cutoff 
date for a particular analysis, OS will be censored for that analysis at the date the patient 
was last known to be alive.
6.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures
The secondary efficacy measures include:  progression-free survival (PFS); tumor response rate; 
1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rate; first sites of disease failure in terms of relapse; patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) using swallowing function as measured by a swallowing diary.
Tumor response will be measured and recorded by using the RECIST Guidelines 
(Attachment 4; Therasse et al. 2000).  Refer to RECIST Guidelines for definitions of measurable, 
nonmeasurable, target, and nontarget lesions.
Best response is determined from the sequence of responses assessed.  For complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR), best response must be confirmed.  A second assessment must be 
performed 28 to 42 days after the original determination of CR or PR is made.  Confirmation 
must occur before the start of any new anticancer therapy not defined in this protocol.  Two 
objective status determinations of CR before progression are required for a best response of CR.  
Two determinations of PR or better before progression, but not qualifying for a CR, are required 
for a best response of PR.  Best response of stable disease (SD) is defined as disease that does 
not meet the criteria for CR, PR, or progressive disease (PD) and has been evaluated at least 
1 time, at least 6 weeks after baseline assessment.
Progression-free survival time is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first 
date of documented objective PD or of death from any cause.  For each patient who is not known 
to have died or to have had objective PD as of the data inclusion cutoff date for a particular 
analysis, PFS will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease 
assessment.  For patients who took any subsequent systemic anticancer therapy prior to 
progression or death, PFS will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free 
disease assessment prior to the date of the subsequent systemic anticancer therapy.

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 64

6.2. Patient-Reported Outcome Measures
The assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as symptoms of disease or 
complications of therapy is becoming an integral part of clinical trials of advanced lung cancer.
Reports from the meta-analyses of combined modality therapy have shown the major impact of 
this therapy has been an increase in esophagitis (Auperin et al. 2007).  This study will focus its 
efforts on assessing swallowing function as a means to assess the negative impact of combined 
modality therapy.
Issues with swallowing will be assessed weekly on the last day of the week while the patient is 
undergoing radiation therapy, immediately prior to consolidation, on Days 8 and 29 during 
consolidation therapy, and at Months 6, 9, and 12 during the follow-up period (Attachment 1).
The above described assessment schedule is not impacted by cycle delays.
6.2.1. Swallowing Diary
Patients will be provided with a swallowing diary similar to that used in the RTOG trials to 
record issues with swallowing using a 5-point categorical scale.  The levels are:  (1) no 
problems; (2) mild soreness; (3) swallowing solids with some difficulty; (4) inability to swallow 
solids; and (5) inability to swallow liquids.  Patients will rate swallowing over the previous 
24 hours.
6.3. Safety Evaluations
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study 
and for alerting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient.
The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patients during the study.
The investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health-care option, 
adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before completing the 
study.  The patient should be followed until the event is resolved or explained.  Frequency of 
follow-up evaluation is left to the discretion of the investigator.
Toxicity will be assessed in accordance with the CTCAE scale, version 3 (NCI 2006).
6.3.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting adverse events that are to be followed regardless of applicable 
regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  A clinical trial adverse event is any untoward 
medical event associated with the use of a drug or drug delivery system in humans, whether or 
not it is considered related to a drug or drug delivery system.
Lack of drug effect is not an adverse event in clinical trials because the purpose of the clinical 
trial is to establish drug effect.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 65

Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug or drug 
delivery system should be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast-feeding are collected for 
regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.
Study site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexisting 
conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in 
the study.  During the study, site personnel will record any change in the condition(s) and the 
occurrence and nature of any adverse events.
After the informed consent document is signed, all adverse events related to protocol procedures 
are reported to Lilly or its designee via eCRF.
All adverse events occurring after the patient receives the first dose of study drug must be 
reported to Lilly or its designee via eCRF.
Study site personnel will record any daily dosage that exceeds the maximum dosage in the 
protocol or in the relevant reference safety document (for example, clinical dosage section for 
humans in the Investigator Brochure), whichever is greater, via eCRF.
Investigators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each adverse event to protocol procedure, radiation therapy, studied disease state, 
study drug and/or drug delivery system via eCRF.
If a patient's dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an adverse event, study 
site personnel must clearly report to Lilly or its designee via eCRF the circumstances and data 
leading to any such dosage reduction or discontinuation of treatment.
Events leading to the clinical outcome of death due to disease progression will be included as 
part of the safety and efficacy analyses for this study and will not be reported to Lilly or its 
designee as adverse events via eCRF unless the investigator believes the event may have been 
caused by the study drug.
Any clinically significant findings, including labs, vital sign measurements, etc. that result in a 
diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its designee using the “Adverse Events/Preexisting 
Condition” page of the eCRF.
6.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse event collection begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has 
received study drug.  If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to 
receiving study drug, the event will NOT be collected unless the investigator feels the event may 
have been caused by a protocol procedure.
Study site personnel must alert Lilly or its designee of any serious adverse event (SAE) within 
24 hours of investigator awareness of the event via a Sponsor-approved method.  Alerts issued 
via telephone are to be immediately followed with official notification on study-specific SAE 
forms.  An SAE is any adverse event from this study that results in one of the following 
outcomes:

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 66









death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization
a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
considered significant by the investigator for any other reason.

Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
Study-specific clinical outcomes of death from PD should be reported as an SAE only if the 
investigator deems them related to use of the study drug.
Serious adverse events will be collected for 30 days after the last dose of study drug or radiation 
treatment, regardless of the investigator's opinion of causation.  Thereafter, SAEs are not 
required to be reported unless the investigator feels the events were related to either study drug, 
radiation treatment, or a protocol procedure.
6.3.2. Laboratory Tests
The schedule for laboratory testing is noted in Attachment 1, and the required tests are listed in 
Attachment 2.  While there are a number of blood tests, blood work being done is considered 
part of routine care.  Some blood work may be viewed as being done more often than might be 
required in usual care but this is occurring to ensure equal probability of ascertaining side effects 
in all patients.  Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) would normally be done prior to radiation 
therapy but would not normally be done after treatment unless clinically indicated.  Extra 
pulmonary function tests are being done as part of the comprehensive toxicity assessment.
Radiologic evaluations are being conducted in accordance with common clinical practice.  This 
includes CT scans at the end of ChRT, before consolidation therapy, after the completion of 
consolidation chemotherapy, and as part of scheduled follow-up.  The protocol has scheduled 
imaging during follow-up to minimize bias in assessment of the 2 treatment arms.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory report by signing or initialing and 
dating each report.
6.3.3. Safety Monitoring
The study site personnel will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study.
The Lilly clinical research physician will review safety data within time frames mandated by 
company procedures and will review trends, laboratory analytes, and adverse events at periodic 
intervals.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 67

6.3.4. Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical trials 
in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and to facilitate process and 
product improvements.
Complaints related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant drugs/drug delivery systems 
are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package 
insert.
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the following aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance with the instructions provided for this study:







recording a complete description of the product complaint reported and any 
associated adverse events using the study-specific complaint forms provided for 
this purpose
faxing the completed product complaint form within 24 hours to Lilly or its 
designee
determining when a drug is to be returned for investigation.

6.4. Sample Collection and Testing

6.4.1. Samples for Standard Laboratory Testing
Blood and urine samples will be collected at the times specified in the Study Schedule 
(Attachment 1).  Standard laboratory tests, including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
panels will be performed.  A pregnancy test will be performed (if applicable).  Other clinical 
laboratory tests will be analyzed by a local laboratory.  Attachment 2 lists the specific tests that 
will be performed for this study.  Investigators must document their review of each laboratory 
report.
Samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed within 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to 
comply with applicable laws, regulations, or laboratory certification standards.
6.4.2. Samples for Central Pathology Review
All sites involved in the Study JMIG will be expected to submit material for a central pathology 
review unless prohibited by local laws or regulations.  The sponsor plans to undertake a central 
pathology review to ascertain the level of agreement in the categorization of non-small lung 
cancer patients of other than predominantly squamous histology.  If sufficient material is 
available, pretreatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or tissue slides 
(if tissue blocks are unavailable) or cytology slides (if neither tissue blocks nor slides from 
biopsies are available) will be collected and sent to the central reference laboratory.  No 
additional biopsy will be performed if there is not sufficient material for central pathology 
review.  Patients will be entered into this study based on the local pathologic determination.  

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 68

Neither patients nor the sites will receive the results of the central pathology review of individual 
cases.
6.5. Appropriateness of Measurements
All efficacy and safety assessments used in this study are appropriate for an oncology study.  
Overall survival is an appropriate primary endpoint in a randomized Phase 3 study.  Progression-
free survival, objective response rate, and PROs are acceptable secondary endpoints and are 
clinically relevant in patients with locally advanced, Stage III NSCLC.  The CTCAE 
(version 3.0, NCI 2006) is an acknowledged method used to evaluate adverse events in oncology 
trials.

7. Data Quality Assurance

To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will do the following:




provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate
sponsor a start-up training session to instruct the investigators and study 
coordinators.  This session will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of 
the eCRFs, and study procedures

 make periodic visits to the study site


be available for consultation and stay in contact with the study site personnel by 
mail, email, and/or fax
review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer edits to detect errors in 
data collection
conduct a quality review of the database.





In addition, Lilly or its representatives may periodically check a sample of the patient data 
recorded against source documents at the study site.  The study may be audited by Lilly MQA or 
its representatives, and/or regulatory agencies at any time.  Investigators will be given notice 
before an audit occurs.
To ensure the safety of participants in the study, and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and patient medical 
records in the patient files as original source documents for the study.  If requested, the 
investigator will provide the sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable ethical 
review boards (ERBs) with direct access to original source documents.
7.1. Direct Data Entry and Computerized Systems
An electronic data capture system will be used in this trial.  The site maintains a separate source 
for the data entered by the site into the sponsor-provided electronic data capture system.
eCRF data will be encoded and stored in a clinical trial database, transferred to the sponsor’s 
data warehouse, using standard Lilly file transfer processes.
Data managed by a central vendor, such as laboratory test data or ECG data, will be stored
electronically in the central vendor’s database system.  Data will subsequently be transferred 
from the central vendor to the Lilly generic labs system.
Data from complaint forms submitted to Lilly will be encoded and stored in the global product 
complaint management system.

8. Sample Size and Statistical Methods

8.1. Determination of Sample Size
The study will enroll approximately 600 patients in 1:1 randomization (300 patients in Treatment 
Arm A and 300 patients in Treatment Arm B).  The primary analysis of OS will be performed for 
all randomized patients.  The primary null hypothesis is that there is no advantage in OS for the 
experimental arm (that is, a survival hazard ratio of 1.00).  There is 1 interim analysis and 1 final 
analysis for OS.  The interim analysis will occur when there are 165 deaths (alpha 
spend=0.000001, beta spend = 0.027).  The final analysis of OS will occur at a time so as to 
include at least 355 deaths, performed using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  The treatment arms 
will be compared using the standard (nonstratified) log-rank test.  Assuming the true OS hazard 
ratio is 0.74 for the patient population with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell 
histology, there will be a minimum of 80% statistical power for the log-rank test.
8.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans

8.2.1. General Considerations
Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of Eli Lilly and Company.  The 
interpretation of study results will be the responsibility of the Lilly clinical research physician 
and the statistician.  The Lilly clinical research physician and the statistician will also be 
responsible for the appropriate conduct of an internal review process for both the final study 
report and any study-related material to be authorized for publication.
Efficacy analyses will be conducted according to the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle with patients 
grouped as assigned to treatment. Safety analyses will include all enrolled patients receiving at 
least 1 dose of anticancer study treatment, grouped as treated.
All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, all tests of 
interactions will be conducted at a 2-sided level of 0.10, and all confidence intervals will be 
given at a 2-sided 95% level, unless otherwise stated.
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any other change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described 
in the clinical study report.  Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as 
deemed appropriate.
8.2.1.1. Qualifications for Efficacy Analysis
All randomized patients will qualify for the following analyses:

 OS with 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates, PFS, and objective response rate

8.2.1.2. Qualifications for Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)
All randomized patients that have provided baseline and at least 1 subsequent measurement of 
the swallowing diary will be evaluated for PROs.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 71

8.2.1.3. Qualifications for Safety Analysis
All randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug for Arm A 
(pemetrexed/cisplatin) or Arm B (etoposide/cisplatin) will be evaluated for safety.
8.2.2. Patient Disposition
A detailed description of patient disposition will be provided.  It will include:






a definition of patient qualification
a summary of data on patient discontinuation
a summary of data on overall qualification status of all patients
an account of all identified protocol violations.

All patients entered in the study will be accounted for in the summation.  The number of patients 
who do not qualify for analysis, who die, or who discontinue before treatment begins will be 
specified.
8.2.3. Patient Characteristics
Patient characteristics will include a summary of the following:





patient demographics
baseline disease characteristics
preexisting conditions.

Other patient characteristics will be summarized as deemed appropriate.
8.2.4. Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medications will be summarized for all randomized patients per treatment arm.
Supportive care interventions, including use of oxygen, parenteral and enteral nutrition, and 
esophageal dilatation will be summarized.
8.2.5. Treatment Compliance
Only authorized study personnel at the investigative sites will administer the study drugs 
assigned for each arm.  Study drugs for both arms are administered intravenously, and vitamin 
B12 supplementation for Arm A is given intramuscularly, only at the investigational site.  As a 
result, patient compliance with these therapies is ensured.
Before each dose of pemetrexed, a medical interview (consisting of yes/no questions) will be 
used to monitor compliance with folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone supplementation 
requirements.  Responses will be documented on the eCRF.
Dose omissions, reductions, and delays will be summarized for all randomized patients per 
treatment arm.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 72

8.2.6. Primary Outcome and Methodology
The primary outcome measure for this trial is OS.  All randomized patients will be included in 
the analysis of OS, which will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of death 
from any cause.  If a patient has not died at the time of the data inclusion cutoff date for the 
analysis, OS will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be still alive.  The primary 
analysis (described in Section 8.1) will be the comparison of OS between the 2 study treatment 
arms using a log-rank test at a 2-sided α=0.05.
8.2.7. Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The secondary efficacy endpoints are PFS, objective response rate, absolute survival rates 
at 1-, 2-, and 3-years, and the first sites of disease failure in terms of relapse within the 
radiation treatment field, at the edge of the radiation field, distant disease, or some 
combination of these.  Secondary analyses for OS will be conducted as supportive 
analyses of the primary analysis.
All randomized patients who were assigned to treatment will be included in the analysis of PFS 
and OS.  For each of the time-to-event endpoints, the following analyses will be performed:

 Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimation (Kaplan and Meier 1958) including generating 

K-M curve, quartiles, and interval estimation using 95% confidence intervals will 
be done for OS and PFS.  In addition, a log-rank test will be used to compare the 
PFS between the 2 treatment arms.

 Estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards models 

(Cox 1972) with assigned treatment as the only covariate and compare treatment 
arms for OS and PFS.

 Log-rank test stratified by the following prognostic variables:  baseline ECOG 
performance status (0 versus 1); gender (female versus male); stage of disease 
(IIIA versus IIIB); and PET scan (yes versus no).

 Cox regression model to obtain treatment effect after adjusting for potential 
prognostic variables (age <70 years versus 70 years), gender (male versus 
female), ECOG performance status (0 versus 1), PET scan (yes versus no), 
disease stage (IIIA versus IIIB), smoking status (never smoked versus smoked), 
ethnic origin (Caucasians versus non-Caucasians).
Note:  This analysis may exclude a cofactor from the list above from Cox models 
for 1 or more of the following reasons:  if there is an insufficient number of 
patients representing 1 level of that variable, if there has been insufficiently 
complete data collected for that variable (if several or more patients are missing 
data for that cofactor), or if that cofactor is consistently found to have no 
prognostic impact (p>0.1) on the time-to-event variables being analyzed.  For 
regulatory purposes, age will be categorized as <65 years versus 65 years.

Objective response rate will be compared between treatment arms based on an unadjusted, 
normal distribution approximation for the difference in rates.  A 95% confidence interval for the 
response rate of each arm will be calculated using an exact method.  Objective response rate will 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 73

be estimated by dividing the total number of confirmed CR and/or PR by the total number of 
patients randomized.
For each arm, compute the number and percent of randomized patients whose first sites of 
disease failure occurred in the following areas:  (1) relapsed within the radiation treatment field; 
(2) relapsed at the edge of the radiation field; or (3) relapsed at distant sites.  A 95% confidence 
interval for each area will be calculated using an exact method.
Patients who discontinue before the study endpoint is reached without PD or death due to any 
cause will have their overall tumor response assessed per protocol and will be included in the 
analysis.
8.2.8. Patient-Reported Outcomes Analyses
Number of patients with post baseline swallowing diary  score 4 will be calculated and 
compared between arms using Fisher’s Exact test. No adjustment will be made for the number of 
available assessments nor will there be any interpolation of missing assessments.  Descriptive 
summaries will include a frequency distribution for the number of completed assessments by 
treatment group.  Further exploration of these measures may be conducted as prespecified prior 
to database lock in the statistical analysis plan.
8.2.9. Safety Analyses
The safety evaluation will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study therapy.  
Safety analyses will include summaries of the following for each study phase:

drug exposure
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
serious adverse events (SAE)
discontinuations due to adverse events





 maximum CTCAE grades for laboratory and nonlaboratory adverse events





hospitalizations and blood transfusions
death
changes in weight
changes in PFTs.

The incidences of selected adverse events from the 2 treatment arms will be compared using the 
Fisher Exact test.
A scatter plot will be provided showing V20 for patients on the x-axis and CTCAE Grade (1 to 4) 
on the y-axis.  The correlation between V20 and CTCAE Grade may be explored.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 74

8.2.10. Subgroup Analyses
Baseline summaries, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox unadjusted analyses of OS, PFS, tumor response 
rate, and summaries of adverse events by maximum CTCAE Grade will be performed separately 
for subgroups based on age, gender, and ethnic origin.  For this analysis, age will be categorized 
into 2 groups (<65 years and 65 years).
8.2.11. Interim Analyses
One formal safety interim analysis is planned for this trial.  In order to minimize the operational 
and statistical bias that result from performing an interim analysis, the interim analysis for this 
study will be conducted under the auspices of a DMC.  The purpose of the DMC is to advise 
Lilly regarding the continuing safety of study participants and the continuing validity and 
scientific merit of the trial.  This interim safety review will be conducted when a minimum of 
6 months has elapsed since the completion of both the chemotherapy and any consolidation 
therapy for the first 100 patients.  This review will provide sufficient data for an accurate 
assessment of the safety, including toxicities such as radiation pneumonitis and esophageal 
complications.
In addition, DMC members will receive periodic SAE summaries 6 months after the start of the 
trial and every 4 months thereafter until the interim safety review.  If any safety signal is seen, 
DMC members may want to meet earlier than the planned safety interim.  Enrollment will 
continue during the safety interim period.  Subsequent to the interim safety review, the DMC 
will be provided with periodic SAE summaries at agreed-upon intervals.
While it is common for DMC to review interim efficacy results so that patients are not 
unnecessarily exposed to futile interventions that cannot achieve the desired result, the accrual 
pattern initially anticipated for this study was such that the required number of patients for this 
trial would have been enrolled and completed therapy before the requisite number of events 
would have occurred for the conduct of any meaningful interim efficacy analysis.  As the accrual 
has been slower than anticipated, it is possible to conduct an interim evaluation to ensure it is 
appropriate to continue to enter patients in this trial.  A futility analysis will occur when at least 
165 deaths have occurred to evaluate the merits of continuing to enroll patients. The DMC will 
be provided with guidance to recommend stopping for futility if the one-sided log-rank p-value is 
>0.5 (corresponding approximately to an observed HR of 1.00 under an exponential model).  For 
the interim analyses, a statistician independent of Lilly will be responsible for documenting the 
fully unblinded interim results and transferring that documentation to DMC members.  This 
independent statistician will also be available prior to and during DMC meetings (for example, 
by telephone) for any necessary clarifications of interim summaries and analyses.
Following the interim analysis at approximately 165 deaths, the DMC will advise the sponsor if 
they believe it is appropriate for the trial to continue as planned.  The results of the interim 
analyses will not be disseminated outside the DMC.  Study sites will not receive information 
about interim results unless investigators need to know these results for the safety of their 
patients.

Section 8.2.9 lists information of accumulated safety data to be performed for interim analyses.
Based on the recommendations of the DMC at the time of the formal interim analysis study 
JMIG was stopped for futility but patients were permitted to continue with assigned study 
therapy as no new safety concerns were noted. However, external advisors recommended to 
conduct safety analyses of the concurrent phase of the study to better understand the tolerability 
of the regimens under investigation, therefore the study team is amending the protocol to add this 
safety analyses. This additional safety analysis will occur after all patients have completed 
concurrent therapy.  This toxicity analysis will include all patients who received at least one dose 
of study therapy and will examine therapy delivered and safety for the concurrent phase of 
treatment by study arm:

drug exposure
radiation exposure including dose delivered and dose prescribed, PTV and V20



 TEAEs
 SAEs
 Discontinuations due to adverse events
 Maximum CTCAE grades for laboratory and nonlaboratory adverse events
 Changes in weight
 Changes in swallowing function.

The incidences of selected adverse events from the two treatment arms will be compared using 
the Fisher’s Exact test. Relationship between planned PTV and selected CTCAEs will be 
explored.
Toxicity prior to the commencement of the consolidation treatment program will be included in 
this analysis. Deaths during the concurrent phase will be pooled and not reported by treatment 
arm in order to maintain the integrity of the final analysis for survival at 355 deaths.  
To preserve the blinding of the study, a statistician independent of Lilly will be responsible for
the safety analyses and for transferring the reports to Lilly.

Informed Consent, Ethical Review, and Regulatory 

Considerations

Informed Consent

9.1.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the patient understands the risks and benefits of 
participating in the study, including answering any questions the patient may have throughout the 
study and sharing, in a timely manner, any new information that may be relevant to the patient's 
willingness to continue his or her participation in the trial.
The informed consent document (ICD) will be used to explain the risks and benefits of study 
participation to the patient in simple terms before the patient is entered into the study, and to 
document that the patient is satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of 
participating in the study and desires to participate in the study.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by each patient or 
legal representative.  This includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the ICD 
prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the administration of study drug.
As used in this protocol, the term "informed consent" includes all consent and assent given by 
patients or their legal representatives.
9.2. Ethical Review
Lilly must agree with all ICDs before they are submitted to the ERB and are used at investigative 
sites(s).  All informed consent documents must be compliant with the International Conference 
on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline on good clinical practice (GCP).  Informed consent obtained 
under special circumstances may occur only if allowed by local laws and regulations and 
performed in accordance with a written process approved by Lilly.
Documentation of ERB approval of the protocol and the ICD must be provided to Lilly before
the study may begin at the investigative site(s).  The ERB(s) will review the protocol as required.
Any member of the ERB who is directly affiliated with this study as an investigator or as site 
personnel must abstain from the ERB’s vote on the approval of the protocol.
The study site’s ERB(s) should be provided with the following:






the current Investigator’s Brochure or package labeling and updates during the 
course of the study
informed consent document
relevant curricula vitae.

9.3. Regulatory Considerations
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in 
the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with good clinical practices and the applicable 

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 77

Investigator Information

laws and regulations.  The investigator, head of the medical institution, or their designee will 
promptly submit the protocol to applicable ERB(s).
An identification code assigned by the investigator to each patient will be used in lieu of the 
patient's name to protect the patient's identity when reporting adverse events and/or other trial-
related data.
9.3.1.
Physicians with a specialty in oncology, or radiation oncology will participate as investigators in 
this clinical trial.
9.3.2. Protocol Signatures
After reading the protocol, each principal investigator will sign the protocol signature page and 
send a copy of the signed page to a Lilly representative.
9.3.3. Final Report Signature
The clinical study report coordinating investigator will sign the final clinical study report for this 
study, indicating agreement that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the report accurately 
describes the conduct and results of the study.  If this investigator is unable to fulfill this 
function, another investigator will be chosen by Lilly to serve as the clinical study report 
coordinating investigator.
The sponsor’s responsible medical officer will sign the final clinical study report for this study, 
confirming that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the report accurately describes the conduct 
and results of the study.

Note:  The use of the tests listed in the study schedule, or of other tests not listed, outside the prescribed schedule of events will be done if clinically indicated. 
a  Assessment to be performed as indicated.  Physical examination, assessment of performance status, and recording of weight should be performed with each 

clinic visit.  For Cycle 1 physical examination, the assessment prior to randomization may be used as Day 1 assessment.  The schedule of events defines visits 
for patients without disease progression to 24 months.  However, patients without disease progression who remain on study beyond 24 months should 
continue visits at 6-monthly intervals from 24 months until 60 months, and yearly thereafter. 

b  Perform prior to the infusion. 
c  Perform at baseline only. 
d  For radiologic tests, CT (including spiral CT) and MRI scans are the preferred methods of measurement.  At minimum, CT scans should have 5-mm 

contiguous cuts through the region of tumor and 5- to 10-mm cuts though the liver and upper abdomen.  Investigators must consistently use the same imaging 
modality as used at the baseline visit during follow-up period.  Other imaging noted in radiologic evaluation is chest x-rays, at the physician’s discretion. 
Baseline:  Should be done within 6 weeks prior to study enrollment. 
During Study Treatment:  Should be done at the end of ChRT and before consolidation therapy (approximately Week 9 to 10).  Imaging must be done 
within 5 working days of the appointment. 
Postdiscontinuation follow-up:  Patients without disease progression at 30 days postdiscontinuation will be evaluated with clinical, laboratory and imaging 
assessments at 6, 9, and 12 months post study entry for the first year of follow-up, every 4 months for Year 2, every 6 months for Year 3, and thereafter as 
clinically indicated. 
After the postdiscontinuation visit, patients will be followed as indicated above with the same imaging modality used at baseline if objective progression has 
not been documented.).  Clinical visits during follow-up can be ± 1 week of anticipated time with an extension to ± 2 weeks for anticipated holidays (statutory 
or planned by patient).  Protocol-mandated imaging during follow-up should be done within 5 working days of the appointment and must be within 
10 working days of the appointment.  Patients with documented objective disease progression will have information about their clinical status collected every 
90 days (±14 days) (refer to Section 5.1.3).  However, the frequency of clinical evaluations, treatment, and testing for patients with disease progression may 
be more frequent than 90 days and should be decided upon by the attending medical team with the best interests of the patient in mind. 

e  CT scans of the abdomen should include the entire liver and both adrenal glands. 
f  A bone scan is acceptable if no FDG-PET is available.

g  Grading as indicated and as needed based on reporting requirements.  After 30-day follow-up, collect only late radiation toxicities. 
h  Pregnancy test should be done within 1 week prior to randomization for women with childbearing potential.  Patients may be entered and enrolled on the basis 

of a local serum or urine pregnancy test; however, a serum pregnancy test must be confirmed by the central laboratory.  Repeat test as clinically indicated. 

i  Baseline:  Laboratory tests should be done within 2 weeks prior to randomization. 

Chemistry–include ALP, ALT, AST, BUN, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, and total bilirubin. 
Hematology–include CBC with differential and ANC. 

  During study treatment:  Blood samples prior to each cycle of chemotherapy may be collected up to 2 working days prior to day of schedule treatment.  
Weekly blood tests will continue until the anticipated end of the chemotherapy cycle even though the patient may have entered the recovery phase between 
concurrent and consolidation therapy. 
Chemistry–should be done as indicated for each cycle of chemotherapy including within 3 working days prior to Cycle 1 of consolidation therapy.  If doses 
are delayed, repeat lab testing before the cycle.  Test is not required during the recovery period unless deemed necessary by the clinical investigator. 
Hematology–should be monitored weekly through 30 days post discontinuation, except during recovery period, unless deemed necessary by the clinical 
investigator. 
Creatinine and magnesium–should be monitored weekly during combination therapy with cisplatin except during recovery.  Creatinine and magnesium 
testing during the recovery period may be conducted by the local lab at the investigator’s discretion.  Creatinine levels should be checked and sent to the 
central laboratory prior to the beginning of each cycle during the consolidation phase and prior to Day 8 cisplatin for patients on the VP-16 consolidation arm.  
If doses are delayed, repeat lab testing before the cycle.  Interim magnesium levels should be assessed according to local policies at a local laboratory during 
consolidation phase for patients receiving cisplatin. 

  Postdiscontinuation visit:  Approximately 30 days after patient discontinuation from the study treatment.  Blood samples can be collected up to 5 working 

days prior to visit during the follow-up period. 

j  Calculated CrCl should be done ≤ 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, as shown in the schedule of events while receiving chemotherapy, and as clinically 

indicated.  Calculated CrCl requires a serum creatinine to be used in the calculation of the CrCl level as per the Cockroft-Gault formula (Cockroft and Gault 
1976). 

k  Serum TSH levels should be measured at baseline, 12 and 24 months poststudy entry.  No TSH measurements are required after 24 months of follow-up. 
l  Should be received by central laboratory within 3 months after the patient is enrolled.  Patients with other than predominantly squamous cell carcinoma that is 

categorized by the local pathologist as “not otherwise specified” (NOS) are eligible. 

m  Patients will be reminded to fill out the diary on a weekly basis (each Friday) through the course of radiation, immediately prior to start of the consolidation 

phase, and on Days 8 and 29 during the consolidation phase.  Diaries will also be completed at follow-up visits.  Assessment schedule is not impacted by 
cycle delays. 

n  Assess per protocol guideline for each study drug and their supplementations.

Guidelines

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 98

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines (Therasse et al. 2000)
Measurability of Tumor Lesions at Baseline:
Measurable lesions:  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as 20 
mm with conventional techniques or as 10 mm with spiral CT scan (longest diameter to be 
recorded).
Nonmeasurable lesions:  All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm 
with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly nonmeasurable lesions.  
Lesions considered to be truly nonmeasurable include the following:  bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging 
techniques, and cystic lesions.
Documentation of “Target” and “Nontarget” Lesions at Baseline:
All tumor measurements will be recorded in centimeters using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the start of treatment but never more than 
28 days before beginning treatment.
Target:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinically).  If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic 
nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.
A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum longest diameter.  The baseline sum longest diameter will be used as the reference by which 
to characterize the objective tumor response.
Nontarget:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including small lesions (longest diameter <20 
mm with conventional CT scan, < 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and other non-measurable lesions 
should be identified as nontarget lesions and should be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence of absence of each should be noted throughout 
follow-up.
Method of Measurement:
The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Computed tomography (CT), or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm.  This applies to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Chest X-ray is acceptable as 
measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT 
scan or MRI is preferred.

LY231514

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 99

Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (for example, skin 
nodules, or palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.
Timing of Subsequent Tumor Assessments:
Radiological and physical assessments will be routinely reviewed as specified in the Study 
Schedule (Attachment 1).  All areas of disease must be re-evaluated at each subsequent 
assessment.  The same technique used at baseline must be used.  Chest x-rays are acceptable for 
a subsequent assessment if used at baseline, however CT scan or MRI is preferred.
If the patient’s disease has responded to therapy, the investigator must confirm the response.  It is 
recommended that confirmation of response occur 28 days and 42 days after the first evidence 
of response using the same radiological technique as at baseline.  The baseline sum of longest 
diameters of target lesions will be used as reference for confirmation of response.
Both measurable and nonmeasurable lesions should be evaluated at each restaging to determine 
whether they have completely resolved or persisted, or whether new lesions have appeared.
Response Criteria:
Patients will be assessed using the following criteria:

 Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all tumor lesions.
 Partial response (PR): Either a) at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum 
LDs or b) complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (but not 
worsening) of one or more nontarget lesions.  In either case, no new lesions 
may have appeared.

 Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 

sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD.
 Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target 
lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment 
started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

 Unknown:  Progression has not been documented and one or more target or 

nontarget sites have not been assessed.

Calvert Formula for Carboplatin Dose according to Renal Function

The Calvert formula to be used with Cockcroft-Gault formula for creatinine clearance:

Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/mL/min) x (CrCl + 25)(mL/min)

Where AUC = area under the concentration-time curve; CrCl = creatinine clearance.
Source:  Calvert et al. 1989.

Maximum carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC 6 (mg•min/mL)  (125 + 25) = 6  150 mL/min 
= 900 mg

Protocol Amendment H3E-MC-JMIG(f) 

Summary

Overview

Protocol H3E-MC-JMIG [Phase 3 Study of Pemetrexed, Cisplatin, and Radiotherapy Followed 
by Consolidation Pemetrexed versus Etoposide, Cisplatin, and Radiotherapy Followed by 
Consolidation Cytotoxic Chemotherapy of Choice in Patients with Unresectable, Locally 
Advanced, Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Other than Predominantly Squamous Cell
Histology] has been amended.  The new protocol is indicated by amendment (f) and will be used 
to conduct the study in place of any preceding version of the protocol.
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as follows:

 Paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen for the consolidation phase revised to 

include per local practice.

 Revised the pemetrexed section to refer to the IB (Safe Handling and 

Administration) or to the Summary of Product Characteristics for instructions 
on the reconstitution and administration of pemetrexed.  

 The method used to compare the change from baseline in swallowing function

revised in the patient-reported outcomes section.   

 Rationale and outline for the previously unplanned and unblinded safety analysis of 

the concurrent phase of therapy.

Materials and Supplies

5.2.
5.2.1.  Concurrent Phase
5.2.1.1.  Pemetrexed/Cisplatin/Thoracic Radiation Therapy
5.2.1.1.1. Pemetrexed
Pemetrexed for injection is a single-use, sterile, lyophilyzed powder packaged in a glass vial, 
containing pemetrexed disodium equivalent to either 100 mg or 500 mg of pemetrexed.  The 
vials contain a 2% excess to facilitate withdrawal of the label amount from the vial.
Each vial must be reconstituted with sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for injection to give a clear 
solution with a concentration of 25 mg/mL to 50 mg/mL according to the instructions provided 
in the package leaflet.  The reconstituted formulation is in the pH range of 6.6 to 7.8 and is 
chemically stable for 72 hours when refrigerated or at room temperature.  However, the drug 
product contains no antimicrobial agent and should be administered within 24 hours after 
reconstitution in the original vial.  Investigational sites should discard unused portions.  
Responsible individuals should inspect vial contents for particulate matter before and after they 
withdraw the drug product from a vial into a syringe.

Patient-Reported Outcomes Analyses

Investigational site personnel cannot administer the concentrated solution without further 
dilution.  For purposes of clinical administration, site personnel must dilute an appropriate 
quantity of the contents of the reconstituted vial into an infusion solution of 100 mL with 0.9% 
sodium chloride solution for injection.  After dilution, the shelf-life of the product is 24 hours at 
room temperature.  Pemetrexed is not sensitive to light.  Vials of pemetrexed contain no 
antimicrobial preservative, and are single use.  Site personnel must not store any unused portion 
for future use, and must discard unused portions of product.
Pemetrexed is incompatible in solution with acidic medications or media, and investigational 
sites must not mix or administer pemetrexed simultaneously with other medications through the 
same infusion line.  Site personnel should flush the infusion line before administration of any 
concomitant medication.  Pemetrexed is compatible with standard polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 
administration sets and intravenous solution bags.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
before administration, whenever solution and container permit inspection.
For instructions on reconstitution and administration of pemetrexed, refer to the IB (Safe 
Handling and Administration) or to the Summary of Product Characteristics.
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country’s regulatory requirements.
8.2.8.
For each patient, the percentageNumber of patients with post baseline swallowing diary 
assessments with scores score 4 will be calculated and compared between arms.  Scores may be 
reported using an AUC method and compared with a z-Fisher’s Exact test. No adjustment will be 
made for the number of available assessments nor will there be any interpolation of missing 
assessments.  Descriptive summaries will include a frequency distribution for the number of 
completed assessments by treatment group.  Further exploration of these measures may be 
conducted as prespecified prior to database lock in the statistical analysis plan.
8.2.11.
One formal safety interim analysis is planned for this trial.  In order to minimize the operational 
and statistical bias that result from performing an interim analysis, the interim analysis for this 
study will be conducted under the auspices of a DMC.  The purpose of the DMC is to advise 
Lilly regarding the continuing safety of study participants and the continuing validity and 
scientific merit of the trial.  This interim safety review will be conducted when a minimum of 
6 months has elapsed since the completion of both the chemotherapy and any consolidation 
therapy for the first 100 patients.  This review will provide sufficient data for an accurate 
assessment of the safety, including toxicities such as radiation pneumonitis and esophageal 
complications.
In addition, DMC members will receive periodic SAE summaries 6 months after the start of the 
trial and every 4 months thereafter until the interim safety review.  If any safety signal is seen, 
DMC members may want to meet earlier than the planned safety interim.  Enrollment will 

Interim Analyses

H3E-MC-JMIG(f) Clinical Protocol

Page 112

continue during the safety interim period.  Subsequent to the interim safety review, the DMC 
will be provided with periodic SAE summaries at agreed-upon intervals.
While it is common for DMC to review interim efficacy results so that patients are not 
unnecessarily exposed to futile interventions that cannot achieve the desired result, the accrual 
pattern initially anticipated for this study was such that the required number of patients for this 
trial would have been enrolled and completed therapy before the requisite number of events 
would have occurred for the conduct of any meaningful interim efficacy analysis.  As the accrual 
has been slower than anticipated, it is possible to conduct an interim evaluation to ensure it is 
appropriate to continue to enter patients in this trial.  A futility analysis will occur when at least 
165 deaths have occurred to evaluate the merits of continuing to enroll patients. The DMC will 
be provided with guidance to recommend stopping for futility if the one-sided log-rank p-value is 
>0.5 (corresponding approximately to an observed HR of 1.00 under an exponential model).  For 
the interim analyses, a statistician independent of Lilly will be responsible for documenting the 
fully unblinded interim results and transferring that documentation to DMC members.  This 
independent statistician will also be available prior to and during DMC meetings (for example, 
by telephone) for any necessary clarifications of interim summaries and analyses.
Following the interim analysis at approximately 165 deaths, the DMC will advise the sponsor if 
they believe it is appropriate for the trial to continue as planned.  The results of the interim 
analyses will not be disseminated outside the DMC.  Study sites will not receive information 
about interim results unless investigators need to know these results for the safety of their 
patients. 
Section 8.2.9 lists information of accumulated safety data to be performed for interim analyses.
Based on the recommendations of the DMC at the time of the formal interim analysis study 
JMIG was stopped for futility but patients were permitted to continue with assigned study 
therapy as no new safety concerns were noted. However, external advisors recommended to 
conduct safety analyses of the concurrent phase of the study to better understand the tolerability 
of the regimens under investigation, therefore the study team is amending the protocol to add this 
safety analyses. This additional safety analysis will occur after all patients have completed 
concurrent therapy.  This toxicity analysis will include all patients who received at least one dose 
of study therapy and will examine therapy delivered and safety for the concurrent phase of 
treatment by study arm:

drug exposure
radiation exposure including dose delivered and dose prescribed, PTV and V20



 TEAEs
 SAEs
 Discontinuations due to adverse events
 Maximum CTCAE grades for laboratory and nonlaboratory adverse events
 Changes in weight
 Changes in swallowing function.

Page 113

The incidences of selected adverse events from the two treatment arms will be compared using 
the Fisher’s Exact test. Relationship between planned PTV and selected CTCAEs will be 
explored.
Toxicity prior to the commencement of the consolidation treatment program will be included in 
this analysis. Deaths during the concurrent phase will be pooled and not reported by treatment 
arm in order to maintain the integrity of the final analysis for survival at 355 deaths.
To preserve the blinding of the study, a statistician independent of Lilly will be responsible for 
the safety analyses and for transferring the reports to Lilly.
