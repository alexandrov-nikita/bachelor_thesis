Protocol Synopsis 

TITLE:  A Phase III, Randomized, Open-Label, Comparative Study of 
DOXIL®/CAELYX™  versus Topotecan HCl in Patients with Epithelial Ovarian 
Carcinoma Following Failure of First-Line, Platinum-Based Chemotherapy 

OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 
DOXIL/CAELYX versus topotecan HCl in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma 
following failure of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy.   

PRIMARY ENDPOINT:  Time to progression following treatment with either 
DOXIL/CAELYX or topotecan. 

SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: Response rate, time to response, duration of response, 
health-related quality of life assessment, survival, and quality-adjusted survival following 
treatment with either DOXIL/CAELYX or topotecan. 

PATIENT POPULATION:  Up to a total of 460 protocol-eligible patients (in order to 
obtain 370 evaluable patients), with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure of 
first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy. 

STUDY DESIGN: This is a randomized, open-label, comparative study of 
DOXIL/CAELYX versus topotecan in the treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian 
carcinoma following failure of first line chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen.  
Patients entering the trial will be stratified prospectively for platinum-sensitivity and 
bulky disease.  Protocol-eligible patients, with measurable or measurable and evaluable 
disease, who have received no more than one prior regimen, which was platinum-based, 
will be randomized to receive either a one-hour intravenous infusion of 
DOXIL/CAELYX, 50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks, or topotecan, 1.5 mg/m2/day as a 30 minute 
infusion for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks.  Patients will be treated for up to one year.  
Patients with ongoing clinical benefit may continue study drug upon approval of the 
sponsor.  

Patients will undergo appropriate radiologic imaging (x-ray, CT scan, MRI) to document 
baseline disease, as well as a chest x-ray and an assessment of left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) by MUGA scan within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. 
Patients will be followed weekly for hematologic toxicities.  Radiologic imaging will be 
repeated every 8 weeks to assess disease status.  Patients who achieve complete or partial 
response will have the radiologic imaging repeated 4 weeks later to confirm the initial 
observation of response.  All patients will be followed for a minimum of one year for 
survival.

LVEF will be assessed by MUGA at baseline, when the cumulative anthracycline dose 
reaches 300 mg/m2, and after every 2 cycles of DOXIL thereafter. 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

STATISTICAL RATIONALE AND ANALYSIS:  A statistical rationale for the number 
of patients has been provided using the proportional hazard model.  Two interim analyses 
are planned after approximately 200 and 280 evaluable patients have either experienced 
disease progression or have been on study for at least 6 months. 

SAFETY:  Physical examinations, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and patient 
monitoring for adverse events.

1.0  Introduction 

 

 

1.1  Background and Rationale 

 

1.1.1  Ovarian Cancer 

In the United States and European countries, ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of 
death due to gynecologic malignancies.  Approximately 26,700 women in the U.S. alone 
will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1996, with an estimated 14,800 deaths due to the 
disease.1  Although the median age at diagnosis is 59 years, the highest age-related 
incidence is seen in women in their mid-to-late 70s.  Survival correlates most strongly 
with surgical staging, and 5-year survival rates for Stages I, II, III, and IV are 74%, 58%, 
30%, and 19%, respectively.  Ovarian cancer is rarely detected in an early stage; 75% to 
85% of patients are first diagnosed with advanced disease (Stages III and IV).2, 3  

The extent of disease in ovarian cancer patients is generally described as either "early 
stage" or "late stage."  For patients with advanced-stage (Stage III or IV) disease, 
combined modality therapy, consisting of aggressive surgical debulking followed by 
platinum-based combination chemotherapy, is the standard of care. 4   With carboplatin- 
or cisplatin-based therapy, a response rate of 60% to 80%  is seen, with a complete 
response rate of 30% to 50%.5,6  Platinum-based multidrug chemotherapy produces a 
slightly better overall response rate, but no difference in survival.  Median survival is 18 
to 24 months, and 5-year survival for patients with Stage III and IV disease is 15% to 
20%.5 As a result of recent GOG studies, paclitaxel and cisplatin therapy is considered by 
many to be the new standard of care for patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.7  
The majority of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer  have a complete clinical 
response (defined by normal physical exam, CT studies, and CA 125) following surgical 
debulking and post-operative chemotherapy.8  However, only 50% of these patients have 
a complete pathological response (defined by negative biopsy specimens obtained during 
second-look laparotomy). 9  

Platinum-sensitivity, which is defined by response to first-line platinum-based therapy, is 
predictive of the response to subsequent retreatment with a platinum-containing regimen.  
Patients who have disease progression during treatment or those who have had stable 
disease in response to initial platinum-based therapy or who relapse within 6 months are 
considered to have platinum-refractory disease.  On the other hand, patients with 
recurrent disease are designated as potentially "platinum-sensitive" if they have a 
progression-free interval of greater than 6 months after response to first-line platinum-
based chemotherapy.  These patients have a 20% to 30% chance of responding to

retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and they are also likely to respond to non-
platinum regimens.  In general, a worse prognosis is seen for those patients with 
progressive disease during their initial chemotherapy, residual bulky disease after initial 
therapy, or recurrent disease within 6 months of treatment.  Such patients are much less 
likely to respond to subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.10, 11  

Patients with recurrent disease have usually been exposed to platinum (cisplatin and/or 
carboplatin) and/or an alkylator, with or without an anthracycline, or paclitaxel.  While a 
patient with recurrent disease is rarely cured, some patients can be rendered disease-free 
for variable periods of time, even years.  In the majority of patients with recurrent disease, 
radiographic evidence of persistent disease, with or without chemical evidence or 
findings on physical examination, will be present.  In other instances, evidence of disease 
may be present only on physical examination or suspected on the basis of a rising 
CA-125.12  

CA-125 levels may be elevated in up to 80% of ovarian malignancies. Because serum 
CA-125 levels may also be elevated or fluctuate in the presence of non-malignant 
conditions, measurement of CA-125 has not proven to be useful as a screening test. 
However, decreasing levels are often associated with response to therapy and increasing 
levels with tumor progression. 12  

 

 

1.1.2  Chemistry and Pharmacology of DOXIL/CAELYX 

The anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin has a broad spectrum of antineoplastic action 
and a correspondingly widespread degree of clinical use.  In addition to its role in the 
treatment of breast cancer, doxorubicin is indicated in the treatment of Hodgkin’s Disease 
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, hepatocellular and gastric carcinoma, small cell cancer of 
the lung, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, as well as cancer of the ovary, bladder, and 
thyroid.  Unfortunately, toxicity often limits the therapeutic activity of doxorubicin and 
may preclude adequate dosing. 

The conventional formulation of the drug is rapidly cleared from the bloodstream and has 
a very large volume of distribution, which may contribute to the drug's toxicity.  High 
cumulative doses of doxorubicin generally must be avoided because of the potential for 
cardiotoxicity, while individual doses are often limited by myelosuppression.  Alopecia 
typically develops and persists throughout treatment.  Severe acute nausea and vomiting, 
stomatitis, and esophagitis are additional adverse effects of doxorubicin that may 
necessitate dose-reduction or discontinuation of the drug.  A doxorubicin formulation 
with improved tolerability would increase the drug's therapeutic ratio and thus enhance its 
efficacy.

Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 
Liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin may reduce both the nonspecific drug delivery to 
normal tissues as well as the high peak plasma levels of free drug responsible for its 
toxicity.  At the same time, a liposomal formulation may deliver doxorubicin to tumors 
with improved specificity.  DOXIL®/CAELYX™ is a doxorubicin formulation in which 
the drug is encapsulated in liposomes (STEALTH® liposomes) that escape instant 
recognition and uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system.  As a result, the 
formulation has a long circulation time, and the liposomes can eventually become 
extravasated through the abnormally permeable vessels characteristic of many tumors.  
Once concentrated in tumors, the liposomes of DOXIL/CAELYX can deliver high levels 
of doxorubicin to malignant cells, without affecting normal tissue. 13 

On-going clinical studies with DOXIL/CAELYX suggest a favorable toxicity profile 
when compared with standard anthracyclines.  Evaluation of the long-term cardiac effects 
of DOXIL/CAELYX, as compared to the conventional formulation of doxorubicin, is on-
going.  There is evidence suggesting that DOXIL/CAELYX is less cardiotoxic than 
conventional doxorubicin.  Histologic examination of cardiac biopsies from patients who 
received cumulative doses of DOXIL/CAELYX from 440 to 840 mg/m2, and had no prior 
exposure to anthracyclines, revealed significantly less cardiac toxicity than in matched 
doxorubicin controls (p < 0.001). 14 In addition to diminished cardiac toxicity, diminished 
gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea/vomiting), decreased incidence of alopecia, and a shorter 
depth and duration of granulocytopenia have been noted. 13 

 

 

1.1.3  Rationale for the Use of DOXIL/CAELYX 

Doxorubicin has not had a role as a salvage agent for ovarian cancer after cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy; response rates have been low and toxicity has been substantial.  Moreover, 
a reduced sensitivity to doxorubicin in a clonogenic assay in tumors obtained from 
patients after initial doxorubicin treatment has been described.15  It is unclear what 
accounts for this decreased sensitivity, and one possibility is enhanced multi-drug 
resistant 1 (MDR1) expression.16 

Liposomal encapsulation may overcome resistance mediated by MDR1.17,18  Furthermore, 
several animal studies have shown that STEALTH® liposomal doxorubicin (DOXIL/ 
CAELYX) is tolerated at higher doses than free doxorubicin.  Preclinical studies have 
shown a clear superiority of DOXIL/CAELYX over free doxorubicin against human 
ovarian cancer xenografts in nude mice.19 

DOXIL/CAELYX has been studied extensively in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's 
sarcoma (N = 1200) and in patients with solid tumors (N = 200).  There are well-
documented cases of anthracycline failure in some Kaposi's sarcoma patients who have 
subsequently responded to DOXIL/CAELYX at a dose of 20 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.  In

this population, 43 patients were identified as having progressed on prior chemotherapy 
with Adriamycin.  Of those 43 patients, response rates ranged from 27% to 52% 
depending on the method of measurement.20 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

In two separate Phase I dose-escalation studies, 56 patients with breast, prostate, ovarian, 
non-small-cell lung (NSCL), melanoma, mesothelioma, pancreatic, GI, uterine, renal cell, 
sarcoma, head and neck, or colorectal cancer were treated with DOXIL/CAELYX in 
doses of 20-80 mg/m2.21  Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis were dose-
limiting at 70 mg/m2 and above.  Skin toxicity manifested primarily as palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia (PPE) was dose-limiting after repetitive doses, but tolerable at doses of 
50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks.  Patients with carcinomas of the breast, ovary, prostate and head 
and neck showed responses or improvement based on tumor markers. 

Substantial clinical activity has been demonstrated in patients with ovarian carcinoma 
refractory to platinum and paclitaxel treated with DOXIL/CAELYX.22  Of 35 patients 
enrolled in a Phase II study in which DOXIL/CAELYX was administered in a dose of 50 
mg/m2, 9 patients achieved responses: 1 patient achieved a Complete Response, 6 
patients achieved partial responses, and 2 patients achieved unconfirmed partial 
responses.  The duration of response ranges from 3.1 months to 10.7 months, with a 
median time to progression of 6.0 months.  While median survival has not yet been 
reached, the 6-month survival is 77 - 80%. 

Preliminary results of the use of DOXIL/CAELYX in 60 patients with breast cancer have 
been reported recently.23  These patients received DOXIL/CAELYX in doses of 60 
mg/m2 every 3 weeks, as well as a better tolerated dose of 45 mg/m2 every 4 weeks.  
Response occurred in 16/43 evaluable patients, with 3 CRs and 13 PRs. The trial is on-
going.  Thus far, 72 patients have been enrolled in this study, and 55 are evaluable; 
responses have been seen in 31% of those patients. 

 

 

1.1.4  Rationale for the Use of Topotecan 

Topotecan is a semi-synthetic, water soluble topoisomerase I inhibitor which has recently 
been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer after failure of first-line therapy.  
Topotecan inhibits the enzyme topoisomerase I, which facilitates DNA replication.  The 
enzyme Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single 
strand breaks.  Because the enzyme’s activity is not linked to proliferative activity, 
inhibitors of topoisomerase I theoretically would be effective in solid tumors with a low 
proliferative index as well as rapidly proliferating cells.24 

On April 19, 1996, FDA’s Oncology Drug Advisory Committee recommended approval 
of topotecan for the treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after

failure of initial or subsequent chemotherapy.  In the registration trial, 226 women with 
ovarian cancer who had failed platinum therapies were randomized either to topotecan or 
to Taxol.  Because the median time to response for topotecan-treated patients was 9 to 12 
weeks in 3 clinical trials, a minimum of 4 courses of the drug is recommended.  In the 
comparison trial, 19.6% of topotecan patients had a complete or partial response, 
compared with 12.3% of Taxol-treated patients.  Of the topotecan-treated patients, 5.4% 
achieved CR, whereas 3.5% of the Taxol-treated arm achieved a CR.  The median 
duration of response was 22.2 weeks for the topotecan-treated arm, versus 12 weeks for 
the Taxol-treated arm.  The median time to progression was 23.1 weeks for the topotecan-
treated patients, compared to14 weeks for the patients on the Taxol-treated arm of the 
study.25 

 

1.2  Objective 

The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of DOXIL/CAELYX 
versus topotecan HCl in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure of 
first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy. 

 

1.3  Study Design 

This is a randomized, open-label, comparative study of DOXIL/CAELYX versus 
topotecan in the treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure 
of first-line chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen.  In order to obtain 370 
evaluable patients, it is expected that up to 460 patients will be enrolled.  Patients 
entering the trial will be stratified prospectively for platinum-sensitivity and bulky 
disease.  Protocol-eligible patients, with measurable, or measurable and evaluable 
disease, who have received no more than one prior regimen which is platinum-based, will 
be randomized to receive either a one-hour intravenous infusion of DOXIL/CAELYX, 
50 mg/m2 every 28 days, or topotecan, 1.5 mg/m2/day as a 30 minute infusion for five 
consecutive days every 21 days.  Patients will be treated for up to one year.  Patients with 
ongoing clinical benefit may continue study drug upon approval of the sponsor.  

Patients will undergo appropriate radiologic imaging (x-ray, CT scan, MRI) to document 
baseline disease, as well as a chest x-ray and an assessment of left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) by MUGA scan within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. 
Patients will be followed weekly for hematologic toxicities.  Radiologic imaging will be 
repeated every 8 weeks to assess disease status.  Patients who achieve complete or partial 
response will have the radiologic imaging repeated 4 weeks later to confirm the initial 
observation of response.  All patients will be followed for a minimum of one year for 
survival.

Primary endpoint is time to progression following treatment with either 
DOXIL/CAELYX or topotecan HCl. 

Secondary endpoints are response rate, time to response, duration of response, survival, 
quality-adjusted survival, and health-related quality of life assessment following 
treatment with either DOXIL/CAELYX or topotecan. 

Safety will be assessed by examination of adverse events, clinical laboratory data, and 
vital signs (See Schedule of Events, pages vi and vii).

2.4  Randomization 

Randomization will be 1:1 between the two treatment regimens.  Patients will be 
stratified by platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease.  Platinum-sensitivity is defined by 
response to first-line platinum-based therapy.  Patients will be assigned to either 
DOXIL/CAELYX or topotecan and, once randomized, will receive the same drug until 
disease progression.  (For definitions, see Sec. 8.4) 

Any patient who withdraws from the study prior to completion of 2 cycles of therapy will 
be replaced, but in such cases the patient number will not be reassigned SEQUUS will 
generate random treatment assignments for each stratum, as well as a set of replacement 
patient numbers.

4.0  Administration of Study Drug 

 

4.1  Investigational Drug Supply 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

Topotecan for injection is commercially available and is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized, 
buffered, light yellow to greenish powder available in single-dose vials. Each vial 
contains topotecan hydrochloride equivalent to 4 mg of topotecan as free base. The 
reconstituted solution ranges in color from yellow to yellow-green and is intended for 
administration by intravenous infusion.  

Each topotecan 4 mg vial is reconstituted with 4 mL Sterile Water for injection. The 
appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution is then diluted in either 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Intravenous Infusion or 5% Dextrose Intravenous Infusion prior to 
administration. Because the lyophilized dosage form contains no bacterial preservative, 
the reconstituted product should be used immediately.  

See APPENDIX V (Topotecan Package Insert) for further storage and handling 
instructions.  

DOXIL/CAELYX will be supplied by SEQUUS in sterile vials, each containing 20 mg 
doxorubicin hydrochloride at a concentration of 2.0 mg/mL.  The study drug must be 
refrigerated at 2° to 8° C.  See Appendix IV (Instructions for Drug Storage and 
Administration of DOXIL/CAELYX) for further storage and handling instructions. 

 

4.2  Dose, Administration and Treatment Schedule 

Treatment with either drug will be continued for up to 1 year in the absence of disease 
progression. 

 

 

4.2.1  Topotecan 

Patients randomized to receive topotecan will be given the drug in a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on day 1 of a 
21-day cycle.  

 

 

4.2.2  DOXIL/CAELYX 

Patients randomized to receive DOXIL/CAELYX will be given the drug in a dose of 50 
mg/m2 over 1 hour every 4 weeks.  See Appendix IV (Instructions For Drug Storage and 
Administration of DOXIL/CAELYX).

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

 

 

4.3.1  Topotecan 

See Appendix V (Topotecan Package Insert). 

 

 

 

4.3.1.1  Hematologic 

Monitoring of bone marrow function is essential.  Prior to the administration of the first 
course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count of > 1500 cells/mm3 
and a platelet count of > 100,000 cells/mm3.   Bone marrow suppression, primarily 
neutropenia, is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan. Neutropenia is not cumulative 
over time. In the event of severe neutropenia during any course, the dose should be 
reduced by 0.25 mg/m2 for subsequent courses.  Alternatively, in the event of severe 
neutropenia, G-CSF may be administered following the subsequent course (before 
resorting to dose reduction) starting from day 6 of the course (24 hours after completion 
of topotecan administration).  

 

 

 

4.3.1.2  Renal Function Impairment 

No dosage adjustment appears to be required for treating patients with mild renal 
impairment (Clcr 40-60 mL/min). Dosage adjustment to 0.75 mg/m2 is recommended for 
patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr 20-39 mL/min).  Insufficient data are 
available in patients with severe renal impairment to provide a dosage recommendation.  

 

 

4.3.2  DOXIL/CAELYX 

See Appendix VI (Guidelines For DOXIL/CAELYX Dose Modification) and Appendix 
VII (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria). 

 

 

 

4.3.2.1  Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia 

In the case of palmar/plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), the dosing intervals may be 
increased if necessary for patients to tolerate therapy.  For patients exhibiting Grade 1 
PPE, continue treatment at the same dose at 4-week intervals if the patient has not 
previously experienced Grade 3 or 4 skin toxicity.  If the patient has experienced a Grade 
3 or 4 toxicity that has now resolved to Grade 1, hold study drug for an additional week.  
If Grade 1 toxicity persists when the dose has been delayed for 2 weeks (6 weeks since 
the last dose), then reduce the study drug dose by 25% and continue dosing at 4-week 
intervals.  If Grade 2 or greater PPE is present on the scheduled day for dosing, hold 
treatment for 1 week.  If the patient still exhibits PPE of Grade 2 or greater after treatment 
has been delayed for 1 week, hold treatment for an additional week.  If the patient

continues to exhibit Grade 2 toxicity after the dose has been delayed for 2 weeks (6 weeks 
since the last dose), then resume treatment at 4-week intervals with DOXIL/CAELYX at 
a 25% reduced dose.  For Grade 3 and 4 toxicity persisting 2 weeks beyond the next 
scheduled dose (6 weeks since the last dose), discontinue study drug therapy. 

Whenever PPE symptoms persist for 6 weeks or longer, the investigator may elect to 
follow the dose modifications outlined above or to withdraw the patient from the study, 
based on an overall risks/benefits analysis. 

 

 

 

4.3.2.2  Hematologic Toxicities 

If a patient develops Grade 2 or 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, study drug will be 
withheld until both are resolved to Grade 1 (ANC > 1500, platelets > 75,000) after which 
study treatment will resume with no dose modification.  If prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia 
(ANC < 500 for > 7 days or failure of ANC to recover by 22 days) thrombocytopenia 
(platelet count < 25,000) develops, wait until both are resolved to Grade 1 and resume 
treatment  with either of the following options:  A) Resume DOXIL/CAELYX with a 
25% reduction in dose; or B) Continue full dose DOXIL/CAELYX therapy with cytokine 
support. The prophylactic use of cytokines is discouraged in conjunction with the first 
dose of DOXIL/CAELYX, but their use is endorsed in subsequent cycles under specific 
circumstances: in patients with prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/mm3 for 
> 7 days, or failure of ANC to recover within 22 days); or the occurrence of febrile 
neutropenia in a prior cycle of treatment. 

 

 

 

4.3.2.3  Bilirubin 

If the total bilirubin rises to > 1.2 (>20 µmol/L) but < 3.0 mg/dL (<50 µmol/L) in the 
prior cycle, a 25% reduction of the DOXIL/CAELYX dose will be required.  If the 
bilirubin rises to > 3 mg/dL (50 µmol/L) and is considered to be unrelated to 
DOXIL/CAELYX, the dose of DOXIL/CAELYX must be reduced by 50%.  If the 
elevation of bilirubin to > 3 mg/dL is considered to be related to DOXIL/CAELYX, the 
patient should be withdrawn from the study. 

 

 

 

4.3.2.4  Stomatitis 

In the case of stomatitis, the dosing intervals may be increased if necessary for patients to 
tolerate therapy.  For patients exhibiting Grade 1 stomatitis, continue treatment at the 
same dose at 4-week intervals if the patient has not previously experienced Grade 3 or 4 
toxicity.  If the patient has experienced a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that has now resolved to 
Grade 1, hold study drug for an additional week.  If Grade 1 toxicity persists when the 
dose has been delayed for 2 weeks (6 weeks since the last dose), then reduce the study

drug dose by 25% and continue dosing at 4-week intervals.  If Grade 2 or greater 
stomatitis toxicity is present on the scheduled day for dosing, hold treatment for 1 week.  
If the patient still exhibits stomatitis toxicity of Grade 2 or greater after treatment has 
been delayed for 1 week, hold treatment for an additional week.  If the patient continues 
to exhibit Grade 2 toxicity after the dose has been delayed for 2 weeks (6 weeks since the 
last dose), then resume treatment at 4-week intervals with DOXIL/CAELYX at a 25% 
reduced dose.  For Grade 3 and 4 toxicity persisting 2 weeks beyond the next scheduled 
dose (6 weeks since the last dose), discontinue study drug therapy. 

Whenever stomatitis symptoms persist for 6 weeks or longer, the investigator may elect to 
follow the dose modifications outlined above or to withdraw the patient from the study, 
based on an overall risks/benefits analysis. 

 

 

 

4.3.2.5  Other (GI, skin, neurologic, etc.) 

For all other Grade 3 and 4 events, a 25% reduction of the DOXIL/CAELYX dose is 
recommended, once the toxicity has resolved to < Grade 2.

(Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days, or failure of ANC to recover within 22 days); or 
the occurrence of febrile neutropenia in a prior cycle of treatment.   

6.0  Adverse Experiences 

 

6.1  Definitions 

An adverse event is any unfavorable, harmful or unintended change involving function, 
structure, or chemistry that occurs during the study, regardless of drug relationship, 
including any intercurrent illness, injury, toxicity, sensitivity or sudden death. 

Any new adverse event that was not evident at screening/baseline or that increases in 
intensity or frequency, or changes in character is to be reported on the Adverse Event 
Case Report Form. 

A pre-existing condition is one that is present prior to or at the start of the study and is to 
be reported as part of the patient's medical history.  It should be reported as an adverse 
event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during study 
treatment. 

Lack of efficacy is a worsening of the disease being studied or lack of desired effect of 
the study drug.  If followed as an efficacy parameter, it should not be recorded as an 
adverse event. 

 

6.2  Reporting Adverse Events 

All adverse events that occur at any time during the study, including the post-treatment 
period as defined in the protocol after drug administration is discontinued, are to be 
reported in the patient’s Case Report Forms.

Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 
Each patient will be evaluated by the investigator or study coordinator at each visit during 
the study for any new or continuing symptoms since the previous visit.  Any symptoms 
changing in character or in intensity should be noted.  Any clinically significant adverse 
event reported by the patient or caregiver or noted by the investigator or study coordinator 
will be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form.  The intensity will be 
evaluated, relationship to study drug will be determined, and any necessary management 
will be recorded in the patient's medical record. 

Intensity will be evaluated using the following criteria: 

Mild (Grade 1):  The patient is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated.  
The event is of little concern to the patient and of little clinical significance.  The event is 
not expected to have any effect on the patient’s overall health or well-being. 

Moderate (Grade 2):  The patient has discomfort enough to cause interference with or 
change in usual activities.  The event is of some concern to the patient’s health or 
well-being and may require medical intervention and/or close follow-up. 

Severe (Grade 3):  The adverse event interferes considerably with the patient’s usual 
activities.  The event is of definite concern to the patient and/or poses substantial risk to 
the patient’s health or well-being.  The event is likely to require medical intervention 
and/or close-follow-up and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.  Hospitalization and 
treatment may be required. 

Life-Threatening (Grade 4):  The patient is incapacitated.  The event poses substantial 
risk to the patient’s immediate health or well-being. 

Relationship to study drug will be assessed using the following criteria: 

Related:  The drug is reasonably suspected as the cause of the event after considering 
basic illness, concurrent illness, concomitant medications, and other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient.  In addition, the event follows a logical sequence from 
administration of the study drug as follows.  The event improves or disappears after 
stopping or reducing the dose, and/or reappears after additional drug exposure; or the 
event is an unusual event that is known to be associated with the drug or this class of 
compound, and cannot be reasonably explained by other therapy or the patient's physical 
condition. 

Not Related:  The event does not meet the criteria above, and the event is known to be 
associated with the clinical conditions or other medications taken by the patient.

7.0  Health-related Quality of Life 

 

7.1  Background and Objectives 

The availability of extensively used and psychometrically validated disease-specific 
health-related quality of life (HQL) instruments for the use in ovarian cancer clinical 
trials is limited.  However, several studies have measured the HQL of cancer patients 
with a variety of diagnoses, using the European Organization for the treatment of Cancer 
Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30).26, 27, 28  The limitation of this 
questionnaire is that it is a general cancer HQL instrument.  A disease-specific modular 
approach is recommended and is frequently used in clinical trials.29  Disease-specific 
modules provide a more comprehensive method for the measurement of HQL in patients 
with a specific diagnosis, i.e., ovarian cancer. 

Using the modular approach and to address the specific needs of this study (ovarian 
cancer and DOXIL/CAELYX toxicities), an ovarian cancer checklist (questions #31-35) 
has been developed and used by the NCIC.30, 31 In addition to this module, 
DOXIL/CAELYX side effect questions (questions#46-48), as well as topotecan side 
effect questions (questions#36-37), and general chemotherapy side effects questions 
(questions#38-45) have been added. There are four other questions featured in this 
questionnaire. The first concerns sexual activity (question#49), the second and third 
concern pain control (questions#50-51). The final question is a global question of 
subjective significance (question #52). This was added to aid in interpreting the meaning 
of the degree of change in terms of clinical relevance for global quality of life. Because of 
the intent of this question, question #52 is only included in all visits after the baseline 
visit.

CONFIDENTIAL 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Doxorubicin HCl Liposome Injection 
SEQUUS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 2.0) instrument contains the following HQL dimensions:  
physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, 
social functioning, and global quality of life/health status.  Symptom scales/items include 
questions related to fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, 
appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact. 

The objective for collecting health-related quality of life data in this study is to obtain 
pilot data and information about the use of the HQL questionnaire for patients with 
ovarian cancer, as well as monitor this patient population for changes during treatment 
when compared to baseline in measuring the effects of chemotherapy on HQL in this 
clinical trial.  The HQL questionnaire is comprised of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 
2.0) and the ovarian cancer checklist/toxicity questions and subjective significance 
question (see Appendix VII). 

7.2  Schedule of HQL Evaluations 

 
Patients will complete the HQL questionnaire prior to study entry, every cycle, at the end 
of treatment visit.  The HQL questionnaire will be completed by the patient on the day of 
the visit corresponding to the physical exam, prior to treatment.  Patients should arrive 20 
to 30 minutes earlier to allow time to complete the questionnaire in the clinic.  
Demographic information will be recorded by the study personnel on the HQL 
questionnaire.  The patient will complete the HQL questionnaire while waiting in the 
reception area to see the physician and before any medical assessments are taken.  The 
HQL questionnaire must be completed at the clinic and not taken home for completion. 
 
The investigator is responsible for adherence to this protocol and to the Questionnaire 
Administration Guidelines for Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire (Appendix 
VIII).  HQL questionnaire will be retrieved by the SEQUUS Study Monitor. 
 
8.0  Study Analysis 

Pretreatment radiographic response evaluations are to be done within the 30-day period 
prior to first dose of study drug.  This 30 day period defines the patient’s disease state at 
baseline which will be compared to subsequent response assessments.  Because the 
primary efficacy endpoint is time to progression, it is imperative that all patients have 
their baseline and subsequent disease assessments completed according to the protocol. 
The lesion measurements resulting from tumor imaging recorded on the case report form 
(CRF) will be those approved by the Principal Investigator after discussion with the 
radiologist and/or appropriate study site staff members.

8.1  Definitions of Disease 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

 

8.1.1  Measurable Disease:  Bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly 

 
defined margins by 1) plain X-ray with at least one diameter > 0.5 cm (bone lesions are 
not included) or, 2) CT, MRI or other imaging scan with both diameters greater than the 
distance between cuts of the imaging study, or 3) palpation with both diameters > 2cm. 

 

8.1.2  Evaluable Disease:  Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with 

 
margins not clearly defined, lesions with both diameters < 0.5 cm, lesions on scan with 
either diameter smaller than the distance between cuts, palpable lesions with either 
diameter < 2 cm.  Malignant ascites or pleural effusion in conjunction with serum levels 
of  CA-125 > 100 U/mL in the absence of cirrhosis. 

 

 
by indirect evidence only (e.g. serum tumor markers or other lab values). 

8.1.3  Nonevaluable Disease:  Pleural effusions, ascites, disease documented 

 

8.2  Definitions of Response 

If an organ has too many measurable lesions to measure at each evaluation, choose 3 to be 
followed before the patient has entered the study.  The remaining measurable lesions in 
that organ will be considered evaluable for determination of disease status.  All 
measurable and evaluable sites must be assessed using the same methodology as at 
baseline. A durable response must persist for 2 separate measurements taken 4 weeks 
apart. 

 

 
and evaluable disease.  No new lesions.  No disease-related symptoms.   

8.2.1  Complete Response (CR):  Complete disappearance of all measurable 

 

8.2.2  Partial Response (PR):  Applies only to patients with a > 50% decrease 

 
in the sum of the products of bidimensional perpendicular diameters of all measurable 
lesions.  No progression of evaluable disease.  No new lesions.  

 

 

8.2.3  Stable Disease (SD):  Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression. 

 

8.2.4  Progressive Disease (PD):  A > 50% increase in the sum of the 

 
products of bidimensionally measured lesions over the smallest sum obtained at best 
response (over baseline, if no decrease); OR reappearance of any lesion which had 
disappeared; OR clear worsening of any evaluable disease; OR failure to return for 
evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer); 
OR appearance of any new lesion/site.  For bone disease, increased up take on the scan

8.4  Stratification 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

Eligible patients will be stratified on the basis of baseline platinum-sensitivity and bulky 
disease.  Platinum-sensitivity is defined by response to first-line platinum-based therapy.  
Patients who respond to initial platinum-based therapy and who have a progression-free 
interval of greater than 6 months off treatment are defined as platinum-sensitive.  On the 
other hand, patients who progress during treatment or who have stable disease in response 
to initial platinum-based therapy or who relapse within 6 months of cessation of therapy 
are defined as platinum-refractory. 

Patients will also be stratified on the basis of the presence or absence of bulky disease.  
Bulky disease is defined as the presence of a tumor mass which is greater than 5 cm in 
size. 

 

8.5  Patient Populations 

 

 

8.5.1  Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) 

 
The ITT Patient Population is defined as all patients who were randomized and received 
at least a partial dose of study drug. 
 
The evaluable patient population is defined as all patients who were randomized, meet the 
enrollment criteria, and received at least 2 cycles of study drug. 
 

8.6  Data Analysis And Statistical Consideration 

8.5.2  Evaluable Population 

 

 

8.6.1  Data Analysis 

Assessment of demographic and baseline characteristics such as age (continuous 
variable), age (< 65yr versus ≥ 65yr), race, Karnofsky performance status (< 80% versus 
≥ 80%), previous therapy (carboplatin versus cisplatin), and ascites (presence or absence), 
will be done to ensure the comparability between the two treatment groups at the time of 
analysis.  Differences between the two treatment groups for categorical data will be tested 
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests, adjusting for platinum-sensitivity and 
bulky disease.  For continuous variables, a three-way analysis of variance will be 
performed with effects for treatment, platinum-sensitivity, bulky disease, and all two-way 
interactions involving the treatment group.  Stratified log-rank test (stratified by 
platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease) will be used as the primary analysis, and the 
proportional hazard model will be used as secondary analyses to test for treatment 
differences in all time-to-event data.

The primary efficacy analysis is a comparison of time to progression between the two 
treatment regimens for the evaluable patient population.  Secondary efficacy analyses 
include response rate, time to response, duration of response, health-related quality of 
life, survival, and quality-adjusted survival.  Statistical analyses will be performed on the 
secondary efficacy parameters for the intent-to-treat (ITT) and the evaluable patient 
populations.  All statistical tests in these analyses will be 2-sided for all variables except 
the time to progression variable.  For all variables, an overall 5% level of significance 
will be used for treatment difference, and 10% level for interaction, with adjustments for 
the 2 planned interim analyses (Section 8.7). 

 

 

8.6.2  Time to Progression, Time to Response and Survival Analyses 

The distribution of overall time to event will be estimated for each treatment using the 
Kaplan-Meier method.  The two treatments will be compared using the stratified log-rank 
test as a primary analysis.  The stratified generalized Wilcoxon test will also be provided. 

In addition, the proportional hazard model will be used  to estimate the overall hazard 
ratio (with 95% one-sided confidence interval) between the two treatment groups and to 
evaluate the effect of covariates.  The main covariates included in this analysis are 
platinum-sensitivity, baseline CA-125, Karnofsky performance status, bulky disease, 
drug-free interval after last dose of first-line therapy (≤ 6 months, > 6 to ≤18 months, and 
>18 months), age, prior therapy (carboplatin versus cisplatin), and the presence or 
absence of ascites at baseline.  Other covariates may also be assessed. 

 

 

8.6.3  Response Analysis 

Comparison of response rates (CR + PR) between the two treatment groups will be 
conducted using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis stratified by platinum-sensitivity, 
and bulky disease.  The response rates will also be summarized using two-sided 95% 
confidence intervals on the difference in the response rates.  

 

 

8.6.4  Duration of Response 

The stratified log-rank statistic will be used for comparison of the duration of response 
curves between the two treatment groups for  responders.  The stratified generalized 
Wilcoxon test will also be provided. 

The proportional hazard model will be used to evaluate the hazard ratio between the 
2 treatment groups and to evaluate the effect of the covariates.

8.6.5   Analysis of HQL Data 

 

CONFIDENTIAL 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

Calculation of each HQL domain scale for the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 2.0), will be 
performed according to the scoring guidelines for each of the HQL measures. The HQL 
analysis will focus on scales measuring physical functioning, pain, nausea, fatigue, and 
global quality of life. 

Change from baseline for the two treatment groups will be compared using general linear 
models.  If a large proportion of HQL data is missing in the later stages of the study, the 
analyses may be limited up to the week where a reasonable proportion of HQL data is 
available.  The covariates considered in the primary analysis may be included in the 
models for HQL as well.   

Furthermore, the number of patients who maintain or improve their baseline HQL scores 
will be tabulated. 

            

8.6.6  Analysis of Q-TWiST 

Quality-adjusted survival will be calculated using the Quality-adjusted Time Without 
Symptoms of disease and Toxicity of treatment (Q-TWiST) method. The purpose of this 
analysis is to evaluate the trade-off between increased toxicity versus improved 
progression-free survival between the treatment groups. 

For each patient, overall survival will be partitioned into 3 periods of time corresponding 
to different health states moving from treatment to death.  These health states are:  
1) Toxicity (Tox) – time with toxicity defined as the time spent with grade 3 or 4 adverse 
events due to study drugs; 2) Time without symptoms of disease and toxicity due to 
treatment (TWiST) – time without either toxicity or progression; and 3) Progression 
(Prog) – total time following documented disease progression until death. 

Standard survival analysis techniques will be used to estimate the mean duration, 
restricted to the follow-up interval of the study, for each of the health states Tox, TWiST, 
and Prog.  Estimates will be obtained for each treatment group separately. 

The average quality-adjusted survival time for each treatment arm will be calculated 
according to the formula below: 

Q-TWiST = U (Tox) x Duration (Tox) + U (TWiST) x Duration (TWiST) + U(Prog) x Duration (Prog), 

where U denotes the health-state specific utility coefficients.

Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 
In addition, Q-TWiST analysis incorporating time with good quality of life and time with 
bad quality of life instead of the time with Tox and TWiST may be explored.  Good or 
bad quality of life will be determined by the Global Quality of Life scale.  Pain, Nausea, 
and Fatigue in the EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scales may also be explored to define the 
duration of maintained good quality of life.   

 

 

8.6.7  Statistical Power and Sample Size Considerations 

In a randomized clinical trial, it has been shown that median time to progression is 
23 weeks for topotecan-treated patients.  We will consider DOXIL/CAELYX to be at 
least as efficacious as topotecan, if the progression-free survival rate of DOXIL/CAELYX 
at 23 weeks, is not more than 10% less than that for topotecan. Therefore, the statistical 
hypotheses of interest to test are as follows: 

H0:  Stopotecan(23) - SDOXIL/CAELYX(23) ≥ 10% 

versus 

H1:  Stopotecan(23) - SDOXIL/CAELYX(23) < 10%,  

where S(23) denotes the progression-free survival rate at 23 weeks. 

Under the proportional hazards model, DOXIL/CAELYX can be considered to be as 
efficacious as topotecan if  

Median time to progression for DOXIL/CAELYX ≥ 23*(ln(.5)/ln(.4)) = 17.4 weeks. 

If the enrollment phase is completed in 24 months, followed by a therapy period of 
6 months to observe for disease response or progression, a total of 350 evaluable patients 
are required, 175 in each treatment group, to assure with a probability of 80% that the 
lower 95% one-sided confidence limit of the hazard ratio of topotecan to 
DOXIL/CAELYX (or median time to progression ratio of DOXIL/CAELYX to 
topotecan) will not fall below 0.757. 

There are 2 additional factors to consider that influence the number of patients required.  
Two planned interim analyses will be conducted (Section 8.7), requiring approximately 
5% more patients to be enrolled.  Second, up to 20% of randomized patients may not be 
evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoints, therefore the number of patients needed to 
be randomized (1:1) is up to 460, depending on evaluability rate.

8.7  Interim Analysis 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

Two interim analyses and a final analysis are planned.  The first and second interim 
analyses may be conducted once 200 and 280, respectively, of the evaluable patients have 
been enrolled and all such patients have either experienced disease progression or have 
been on study for at least 6 months. Enrollment will continue while the interim analyses 
are being conducted. A final analysis will be conducted at the end of the study when 
approximately 370 evaluable patients have either experienced disease progression or have 
been on study for at least 6 months. 

The O’Brien-Fleming-type spending function was utilized to determine the appropriate 
boundaries for the group sequential approach and were calculated using EaSt software.34  
In accordance with this approach, the nominal α levels needed to maintain an overall 
significance level of 0.05 are 0.008, 0.022, and 0.042 for the first, second, and final look 
at the data, respectively.  The study is planned to be terminated if the O’Brien-Fleming 
boundary is crossed at any of the interim analyses (first interim analysis: p=0.008; second 
interim analysis: p=0.022).  When a decision has been made to terminate the study, all 
data will be brought in-house and final statistical analyses will be performed. 

The primary efficacy parameter for the interim analyses is time to progression. 

The log-rank test stratified for platinum sensitivity and bulky disease will be considered 
the primary efficacy analysis for the interim as well as final analyses. The hazard ratio 
and corresponding one-sided (1-α)% confidence interval from a proportional hazard 
regression model will also be presented. In addition, response rates will also be calculated 
as a supplemental analysis to support the primary efficacy parameter results.  Response 
rates for each of the enrollment stratum will be calculated.  Treatment group differences 
will be tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for platinum-
sensitivity and bulky disease. 

The interim analyses may also include an analysis of HQL data and quality-adjusted 
survival time. 

 

8.8 Additional 

 
As stated in the protocol, the end of planned treatment analysis was the final formal analysis to 
be conducted on Doxil Protocol 30-49.  However the analyses conducted for this report 
yielded results that could be clarified by additional analyses.  While the overall survival 
time did not differ between the Doxil and topotecan groups, there was a statistically 
significant survival advantage for Doxil in the subgroup of platinum sensitive patients.

At the time of data cutoff for this planned end of treatment report, over 50 % of the 
platinum sensitive patients were still alive.  ALZA will conduct an additional set of 
survival and progression free survival analyses when 90% of the patients have either died 
or been lost to follow-up.  These analyses will be for the purpose of assessing whether the 
survival advantage in the platinum sensitive group sustained, and examining the overall 
survival differences between the Doxil and topotecan groups.

received will also be provided where appropriate . 

9.0  Study Administration and Investigator Obligations 

 

9.1  Institutional Review Board 

This study must have the approval of a properly constituted  Hospital Ethics Committee, 
Regional Ethics Committee  or other Institutional Review Board (IRB). 

Before the investigational drug will be shipped to the investigator, the investigator will 
provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB approval letter stating that the study protocol 
and informed consent form have been reviewed and approved by the IRB. 

All serious and clinically important adverse experiences must also be reported to the IRB 
by the investigator. 

 

9.2  Informed Consent 

It is the responsibility of the investigator to design the Informed Consent form using 
appropriate National or Regional Guidelines (equivalent to the American Federal 
Guidelines (Federal Register--July 27, 1981, or 21 CFR Part 50). 

The consent form must be approved by the Institutional Review Board.  A copy of the 
approved form must be submitted to the Sponsor prior to the initiation of the study.  State 
and local laws, and/or institutional requirements may require the disclosure of additional 
information on the informed consent form.

SEQUUS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 
A copy of the informed consent form must be given to the patient.  The investigator must 
keep each patient’s signed consent form on file for inspection by a regulatory authority at 
any time. 

 

9.3  Drug Accountability 

The investigator will not supply DOXIL/CAELYX to any patient not enrolled in the 
study, or to any physicians or scientists except those designated as co-investigators. 

For sites in Europe, the investigator is expected to comply with the Declaration of 
Helsinki, adopted June, 1964 and amended in Tokyo, October, 1975; Venice, October, 
1983 and Hong Kong, September, 1989 (refer to Appendix IX). 

The investigator must ensure that personnel who administer the study drugs to patients 
understand the dosing procedures.  The investigator or pharmacist will record drug 
distribution on a log form provided with each shipment. 

Each shipment of drug supplies for a study will contain an investigational drug 
Transmittal and Receipt Form to assist the investigator in maintaining current and 
accurate inventory records. 

Records should cover receipt, dispensing, and the return of study drug supplies. 

The investigational Transmittal and Receipt Form will be included routinely for all 
studies, and will identify for each shipment the subject identification code (if applicable), 
the lot number, and the quantity of vials contained in the shipment. 

Upon receipt of the investigational drug, the pharmacist shall visually inspect the 
shipment and verify the number and condition of vials received.  The lower portion of the 
investigational transmittal and receipt form shall be completed and signed by the 
pharmacist.  A copy of the signed form is to be filed with the inventory/drug 
accountability records.  The original completed form is to be mailed back to SEQUUS, in 
the envelope provided with the drug shipment. 

The drug supply will be packaged and shipped in insulated containers. Only authorized 
personnel should have access to the drug.  For accurate accountability, the following 
information must be noted when drug supplies are used during the course of the study:  
the identification code of the subject to whom the drug is dispensed, the lot number of the 
drug dispensed for that subject, and the date(s) and quantity of drug dispensed. Inventory 
records must be readily available for inspection by the study monitor and are open to 
FDA inspection at any time.

Return of all drug supplies must be coordinated with the Clinical Research Associate 
(CRA) prior to shipment.  When unused drug supplies are to be returned, the pharmacist 
should record the number of vials and lot numbers being returned in their inventory log, 
and complete the Return Authorization Form provided by SEQUUS.  Further instructions 
for return will be provided by SEQUUS. 

Study Protocol:  SEQUUS-30-49 
Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

Upon completion of this study the investigator and pharmacist should verify and sign that 
all unused drug supplies have been returned and that no drug supplies remain in the 
investigator’s possession.  If all drug supplies are not returned, the investigator and 
pharmacist must include an explanation and document this in the accountability records.  
A copy of the inventory sheets and drug accountability information must be returned to 
the Sponsor at the end of the study. 

 

9.4  Record Retention 

It is the responsibility of the investigator and the study staff to maintain a comprehensive 
and centralized filing system of all documentation relevant to the study.  Such 
documentation includes: 
•  Case Report Forms—must be legible, accurate, and up-to-date. 
•  Patient Files—should substantiate the data entered in the Case Report Forms with 

regard to laboratory data, patient histories, treatment regimens, etc. 

•  Patient Exclusion Record—should record the reason any patient was screened for the 

study and found to be ineligible. 

•  Drug Dispensing Log—should record the total amount of investigational drug 

received and returned to the Sponsor, and the amount distributed and returned.  This 
information must agree with the information entered in the Case Report Forms. 
Informed Consent Forms—completed consent forms from each patient must be 
available and verified for proper documentation. 
Informed Consent Log—must identify all patients entered into the study such that the 
patients can be identified by audit. 

• 

• 

Protocols, amendments, IRB approvals, FDA-1572 forms, all correspondence, and any 
other documents pertaining to the conduct of the study, must be kept on file by the 
Principal Investigator for a minimum of 2 years after notification by the Sponsor of either 
NDA approval or discontinuation of the IND.

Instructions For Drug Storage and 
Administration of DOXIL/CAELYX 

 

HOW SUPPLIED 
 
DOXIL/CAELYX is supplied in vials as a liquid.  Each vial contains 20 mg 
doxorubicin HCl.   
 
Do not use if a precipitate or foreign matter is present. 
 
Do not use if vial seal is breached. 

 

 

STORAGE OF MATERIAL 
 
Store DOXIL/CAELYX in a refrigerator at 2° to 8°C.  Avoid freezing. 

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
 
The vial contains 2.0 mg/mL doxorubicin HCl, unless specified otherwise on the label.  
Determine the volume of DOXIL/CAELYX to be administered (based upon the dose 
specified in the protocol). 
 
Take the appropriate volume of DOXIL/CAELYX up into a sterile syringe.  Aseptic 
technique must be strictly observed since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present 
in DOXIL/CAELYX.  Each vial is single use only. 
 
Dilute the DOXIL/CAELYX in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (D5W).  For doses > 12 mg 
and < 90 mg, dilute in 250 mL of D5W.  For doses > 90 mg, dilute in 500 mL of D5W.  
Once the DOXIL/CAELYX has been diluted it must be kept refrigerated at 2° to 8°C and 
administered within 24 hours of mixing.  Ordinarily, the drug will be administered by 
intravenous infusion over 1 hour.  However, because of occasional acute reactions to the 
first dose, that initial infusion can be administered more slowly if necessary.  Infusion 
may be given through a peripheral vein or a central line.

HANDLING AND DISPOSAL 
 
DOXIL/CAELYX should not be mixed with other drugs until specific compatibility data 
are available.  
 
The presence of any bacteriostatic agent, such as benzyl alcohol, may cause precipitation 
of DOXIL/CAELYX. 
 
Caution should be exercised in handling DOXIL/CAELYX solution. The use of gloves is 
recommended. If DOXIL/CAELYX comes into contact with skin or mucosa, immediately 
wash thoroughly with soap and water. 
 
DOXIL/CAELYX should be handled and disposed of in a manner consistent with other 
anti-cancer drugs.

Introduction 
 
Guidelines for administering the Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (HQLQ) 
during this clinical study are presented in this document.  The questionnaire will be 
completed by the patients during their scheduled visits. 
 
These guidelines assume that an appropriate person has been designated to facilitate self-
administration of the questionnaires and enter the data with each investigator's office, and 
that a procedure has been established for recording the patient's initials and identification 
number, visit date, and site code on the questionnaire, as well as reviewing the 
questionnaire for completeness. 
 
Foreign Speaking Patients, Visual Problems 
 
Patients must be able to read the language of their country in order to complete the 
HQLQ.  If a patient is not able to speak the language of their country, check if the patient 
is able to read the language of their country, and if so, give the patient the questionnaire. 
 
The Questionnaire was prepared under the assumption that patients would not have 
problems reading a questionnaire that has normal-size type.  In general, if a clinical study 
is expected to have a large number of patients who have visual problems, a large-type 
version of the questionnaire also should be prepared.  If the questionnaire is to be given to 
a large number of patients who are unable to read, then an interviewer-administered 
version of the form and accompanying script for the interviewer must be developed.   
 
When Should the Questionnaire Be Administered? 
 
The Questionnaire should be administered before the patient sees the physician, so that 
the interaction between the patient and physician will not influence the patient's answers 
to the questionnaire.  Ideally, the questionnaire also should be administered before the 
patient is asked about adverse experiences and concurrent illnesses, again so that any 
discussions of health problems do not influence the patient's answers to the questionnaire.  
It is important that the Questionnaire be administered and the adverse event questions be 
asked in the same order in all study sites.

Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

 
 
How Should the Questionnaire Be Introduced? 
 
A sample script for introducing the questionnaire is given below.  This is one possible 
script that could be used.  Staff members at each study site can reword this script so that it 
sounds more like their natural style of speech and fits the setting of the clinical site. 
 
“Your doctor would like to better understand how you and other patients in this study 
feel, how well you are able to do your usual activities, and how you rate your health.  To 
help us understand these things about you and other patients better, please complete this 
questionnaire about your health. 
 
The questionnaire is easy to fill out.  The instructions are on the front cover [point to 
them].  You should read each question and then circle the appropriate number that 
matches your answer.  Remember, this is not a test and there are no right or wrong 
answers.  Choose the answer that best describes the way you feel.  I will quickly review 
your questionnaire when you are done to make sure that all the questions have been 
answered. 
 
You should answer these questions by yourself.  Spouses or other family members should 
not help you when you answer the questionnaire.  I will be nearby in case you want to ask 
me any questions.  Please return the questionnaire to me when you are done.” 
 
What To Do if the Patient Asks for Clarification of Survey Items 
 
Some patients may ask what specific questions mean.  If this happens, the staff member 
can assist the patient by rereading the question for them verbatim.  If the patient asks 
what something means, do not try to explain what the question means, but tactfully 
suggest that the patient use their own interpretation of the question.  All patients should 
answer the questions based on what they think the questions mean, or the study results 
may be biased.

Questionnaire Completion 
 
When the patient returns the questionnaire, check that all the questions have been 
answered.  If the questionnaire is not complete, tell the patient that some of the questions 
weren't answered.  If the patient does not quickly volunteer to answer these items, ask the 
patient whether she had any difficulty completing the questionnaire. 

If the patient says that she had trouble understanding a question, ask the patient why  she 
had difficulty with that item.  Reread the question for her verbatim, but do not attempt to 
explain or reword the question, as explained before.  If the patient is still unable to 
complete the question, accept the questionnaire as incomplete. 
 
Some patients may be confused by the response choices.  They may want to respond with 
"I don't know" or some other response choice that is not on the questionnaire.  If that 
happens, try to tactfully help the patient choose one of the response categories by saying 
something like:  "I know it may be hard for you to pick an answer, but which of these 
answers do you think comes closest to the way that you are thinking or feeling?"  If the 
patient still can't select an answer, accept the questionnaire as incomplete. 
 
Occasionally, patients may not report having difficulty with a question or with the 
response choices, but still may hesitate or refuse to answer an item or items.  If this 
happens, accept the questionnaire as incomplete. 
 
For questions that are incomplete, please indicate for that question, directly on the 
questionnaire “patient prefers not to answer”. 
 
The questionnaire should also be reviewed for these common errors; should the patient 
still be unable to select a single answer, then the following rules will apply: 
 
(1) 

If a respondent circles two responses and the responses are adjacent to each other, 
choose the lower number. 

 
(2) 

 

 
 

If a respondent circles two responses for an item and they are not adjacent to each 
other, code the lower number.

Appendix IX (cont.) 

If a respondent circles three or more responses for an item, code that item 
“missing”. 

If a respondent answers the “yes/no” items by writing in “yes” or “no”, code the 
answer as though “yes” or “no” had been circled. 

If a respondent places a circle or mark between two responses, code the lower 
number. 

 
Please review the specific DOs and DON'Ts of Questionnaire Administration in Table 1.  
If a patient asks for interpretation of their responses or asks for their score on the 
questionnaire, tell respondents that you are not trained in how to score or interpret the 
questionnaire.  Emphasize that their answers are to be kept confidential. 
 
Completed Questionnaires 
 
In general, when questionnaires like the SF-36 or EORTC QLQ-C30 are administered in 
clinical settings, the patient is thanked once she has completed the questionnaire and the 
staff member has checked it for completeness.  A draft script for thanking the patient is 
provided below.  Again, the staff member should reword this to sound like their natural 
speech. 
 
“Thank you for taking the time to complete this survey.  We will be asking you to 
complete this survey again during this study.” 
 
Depending on the visit week, the second sentence can be modified to say the number of 
additional times the survey will be administered, or to say that this is the last time that the 
survey will be administered.  Because the patient is providing other information during 
her visit, a specific thank you for completing the HRQL Questionnaire may not be 
appropriate in this study. 
 
Physician/Staff Review of Questionnaires 
 
The physician should not be allowed to review the questionnaire.  Physicians may be 
interested in knowing the results for their patients, especially if they know that quality of

life questionnaires are currently being used in some physician's practices.  However, 
allowing the physician to review the survey introduces a potential bias into the study, 
since a physician might discuss the results with patients or somehow influence patient's 
answers on subsequent administrations of the survey.  Even if a physician does not mean 
to do this, the potential for inadvertently doing so exists. 
 
Staff members who administer the questionnaire and enter the data also should not 
discuss the results with patients.  If a patient asks about her results, the staff member 
should say that the results are being analyzed as part of the study and that staff members 
at the individual sites cannot interpret the results.  The patient also could be reminded that 
the Questionnaire is not a test and that there are no right or wrong answers. 
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting and QOL Assessment 
 
Site personnel should not attempt to reconcile QOL responses and adverse events, unless 
specifically instructed by protocol.

DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 

 

Recommendations guiding medical doctors in biomedical research involving human 
subjects 
 
Adopted  by  the  18th  World  Medical  Assembly,  Helsinki,  Finland,  June  1964  and 
amended  by  the  29th  World  Medical  Assembly,  Tokyo,  Japan,  October  1975  the  35th 
World  Medical  Assembly,  Venice,  Italy,  October  1983  and  the  41st  World  Medical 
Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
It  is  the  mission  of  the  physician  to  safeguard  the  health  of  the  people.  His  or  her 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this mission. 
 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with 
the world, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International 
Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the patient's interest 
when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and 
mental condition of the patient". 
 
The  purpose  of  biomedical  research  involving  human  subjects  must  be  to  improve 
diagnostic,  therapeutic  and  prophylactic  procedures  and  the  understanding  of  the 
aetiology and pathogenesis of disease. 
 
In  current  medical  practice  most  diagnostic,  therapeutic  or  prophylactic  procedures 
involve hazards. This applies especially to biomedical research. 
 
Medical  progress  is  based  on  research  which  ultimately  must  rest  in  part  on 
experimentation involving human subjects. 
 
In the field of biomedical research a fundamental distinction must be recognized between 
medical research in which the aim is essentially diagnostic or therapeutic for a patient, 
and  medical  research,  the  essential  object  of  which  is  purely  scientific  and  without 
implying direct diagnostic of therapeutic value to the person subjected to the research.

APPENDIX X  (cont.) 

 
Special  caution  must  be  exercised  in  the  conduct  of  research  which  may  affect  the 
environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 
 
Because  it  is  essential  that  the  results  of  laboratory  experiments  be  applied  to  human 
beings to further scientific knowledge and to help suffering humanity, the World Medical 
Association has prepared the following recommendations as a guide to every physician in 
biomedical research involving human subjects. They should be kept under review in the 
future. It must be stressed that the standards as drafted are only a guide to physicians all 
over  the 
  world.  Physicians  are  not  relieved  from  criminal,  civil  and  ethical 
responsibilities under the laws of their own countries. 
 
I - BASIC PRINCIPLES 
 
1.  Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted 
scientific  principles  and  should  be  based  on  adequately  performed  laboratory  and 
animal experimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature. 

 
2.  The  design  and  performance  of  each  experimental  procedure  involving  human 
subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be 
transmitted  for  consideration,  comment  and  guidance  to  a  specially  appointed 
committee  independent  of  the  investigator  and  the  sponsor  provided  that  this 
independent committee is in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country 
in which the research experiment is performed. 

 
3.  Biomedical  research  involving  human  subjects  should  be  conducted  only  by 
scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent 
medical  person.  The  responsibility  for  the  human  subject  must  always  rest  with  a 
medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even though 
the subject has given his or her consent. 

 
4.  Biomedical  research  involving  human  subjects  cannot  legitimately  be  carried  out 
unless  the  importance  of  the  objective  is  in  proportion  to  the  inherent  risk  to  the 
subject.

Amendment #3: March 26, 2001 

CONFIDENTIAL 

 

APPENDIX X  (cont.) 

 
5.  Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by 
careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the 
subject or to others. Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over 
the interests of science and society. 

 
6.  The  right  of  the  research  subject  to  safeguard  his  or  her  integrity  must  always  be 
respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject and 
to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and 
on the personality of the subject. 

 
7.  Physicians  should  abstain  from  engaging  in  research  projects  involving  human 
subjects  unless  they  are  satisfied  that  the  hazards  involved  are  believed  to  be 
predictable.  Physicians  should  cease  any  investigation  if  the  hazards  are  found  to 
outweigh the potential benefits. 

In  publication  of  the  results  of  his  or  her  research,  the  physician  is  obliged  to 
preserve the accuracy of the results. Reports of experimentation not in accordance 
with  the  principles  laid  down  in  this  Declaration  should  not  be  accepted  for 
publication. 

In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed 
of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the 
discomfort it may entail. He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to 
abstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw his or 
her  consent  to  participation  at  any  time.  The  physician  should  then  obtain  the 
subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. 

 
10.  When  obtaining  informed  consent  for  the  research  project  the  physician  should  be 
particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship to him or her or may 
consent  under  duress.  In  that  case  the  informed  consent  should  be  obtained  by  a 
physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent 
of this official relationship.

APPENDIX X  (cont.) 

 
11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal 
guardian  in  accordance  with  national  legislation.  Where  physical  or  mental 
incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a 
minor,  permission  from  the  responsible  relative  replaces  that  of  the  subject  in 
accordance  with  national  legislation.    Whenever  the  minor  child  is  in  fact  able  to 
give a consent, the minor's consent must be obtained in addition to the consent of the 
minor's legal guardian. 

 
12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration 
are complied with. 

 
II - MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH PROFESSIONAL CARE 
      (Clinical research) 
 
1. 

In  the  treatment  of  the  sick  person,  the  physician  must  be  free  to  use  a  new 
diagnostic  and  therapeutic  measure,  if  in  his  or  her  judgement  it  offers  hope  of 
saving life, reestablishing health or alleviating suffering. 

 
2. 

 
3. 

 
4. 

 
5. 

 
 

The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed 
against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 

In  any  medical  study,  every  patient  -  including those of a control group, if any - 
should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. 

The  refusal  of  the  patient  to  participate  in  a  study  must  never  interfere  with  the 
physician-patient relationship. 

If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific 
reasons  for  this  proposal  should  be  stated  in  the  experimental  protocol  for 
transmission to the independent committee (I, 2.).

APPENDIX X  (cont.) 

 

The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective 
being  the  acquisition  of  new  medical  knowledge,  only  to  the  extent  that  medical 
research is justified by its potential diagnostic or therapeutic value for the patient. 

 
III  -  NON-THERAPEUTIC  BIOMEDICAL  RESEARCH  INVOLVING  HUMAN 

SUBJECTS (Non-clinical biomedical research) 

In  the  purely  scientific  application  of  medical  research  carried  out  on  a  human 
being, it is the duty of the physician to remain the protector of the life and health of 
that person on whom biomedical research is being carried out. 

The subjects should be volunteers - either healthy persons or patients for whom the 
experimental design is not related to the patient's illness. 

The  investigator  or  the  investigating  team  should  discontinue  the  research  if  in 
his/her or their judgement it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual. 

In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence 
over considerations related to the well-being of the subject.

Platinum-Based Chemotherapy 

 
Rationale for clinical changes: 
 
The criteria for assessing the relationship of the study drug to an adverse experience was 
revised to reflect the current SEQUUS standard criteria. 
 
After consultation with Dr. 
Life Questionnaire, we have amended the question content to reflect symptoms seen 
within this group of patients and to look more closely at side effects that may be 
encountered.

Section 6.2, Reporting Adverse Events 
Probably Related:  An event that follows a logical sequence from 
administration of the drug, improvement or disappearance after 
stopping or reducing the dose (dechallenge), and/or reappearance of 
the event after repeated exposure (rechallenge), or an unusual event 
that is known to be associated with the drug or this class of compound, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by other therapy or the patient's 
physical condition. 
Possibly Related:  An event that follows a plausible sequence and it is 
reasonable to suspect drug causation after considering basic illness, 
concurrent illness, concomitant medications, and other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.

After… “with a specific diagnosis, i.e., ovarian cancer”: 
Using the modular approach and to address the specific needs of this 
study (ovarian cancer and DOXIL/CAELYX toxicities), an ovarian 
cancer checklist (questions #31-43, 47-53) has been developed and 
used by the NCIC.30, 31  In addition to this module, DOXIL/CAELYX 
side effect questions (questions #44-55), as well as a global question of 
subjective significance (question #54) were also included.  The latter 
was added to aid in interpreting the meaning of the degree of change in 
terms of clinical relevance for global quality of life.  Because of the 
intent of this question, Question #54 is only included in all visits after 
baseline assessment.

A Phase III, Randomized, Open-Label, Comparative Study of 
DOXIL/CAELYX versus Topotecan HCl in Patients with 
Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma Following Failure of First-Line, 
Platinum-Based Chemotherapy 

 
Rationale for clinical changes: 
The Principal Investigator will determine the lesion measurement reported on the CRF for 
study analysis after discussion with the radiologist and/or appropriate study site staff 
member. This clarification specifies who has final responsibility for assessing lesion 
sizes. 

Progressive disease based on measurement of tumor size is defined as "A > 50% increase, 
or an increase to 10 cm2 (whichever is smaller) in the sum of the products of 
bidemensionally measured lesions over the smallest sum obtained at best response (over 
baseline, if no decrease)…." The practice of defining progressive disease as an increase of 
tumor size to 10 cm2 has not been applied by investigators for a number of valid reasons: 

• 

• 

In many cases the baseline and/or smallest sum obtained at best response is greater 
than 10 cm2, so the rule cannot be applied. 

In other cases the baseline and/or smallest sum obtained at best response is close to 
10 cm2 (e.g., 9 cm2) and an increase to 10 cm2 was considered within the range of 
measurement error and not considered progressive disease. 

Therefore the definition of disease progression was refined to an increase of > 50% in 
tumor size.

Analysis of Q-TWiST 

Furthermore, the number of patients who maintain or improve their 
baseline HQL scores will be tabulated. 
8.6.6 
Quality-adjusted survival will be calculated using the Quality-adjusted 
Time Without Symptoms of disease and Toxicity of treatment (Q-
TWiST) method. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the trade-
off between increased toxicity versus improved progression-free 
survival between the treatment groups. 
For each patient, overall survival will be partitioned into 3 periods of 
time corresponding to different health states moving from treatment to 
death.  These health states are:  1) Toxicity (Tox) – time with toxicity 
defined as the time spent with grade 3 or 4 adverse events due to study 
drugs; 2) Time without symptoms of disease and toxicity due to 
treatment (TWiST) – time without either toxicity or progression; and 
3) Progression (Prog) – total time following documented disease 
progression until death. 
Standard survival analysis techniques will be used to estimate the 
mean duration, restricted to the follow-up interval of the study, for 
each of the health states Tox, TWiST, and Prog.  Estimates will be 
obtained for each treatment group separately. 
The average quality-adjusted survival time for each treatment arm will 
be calculated according to the formula below: 
Q-TWiST = U (Tox) x Duration (Tox) + U (TWiST) x Duration (TWiST) + U(Prog) x 
Duration (Prog), 
where U denotes the health-state specific utility coefficients. 
In addition, Q-TWiST analysis incorporating time with good quality of 
life and time with bad quality of life instead of the time with Tox and 
TWiST may be explored.  Good or bad quality of life will be 
determined by the Global Quality of Life scale.  Pain, Nausea, and 
Fatigue in the EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scales may also be 
explored to define the duration of maintained good quality of life.

The O’Brien-Fleming-type spending function was utilized to determine 
the appropriate boundaries for the group sequential approach and were 
calculated using EaSt software.34  In accordance with this approach, 
the nominal α levels needed to maintain an overall significance level 
of 0.05 are 0.008, 0.022, and 0.042 for the first, second, and final look 
at the data, respectively.  The study is planned to be terminated if the 
O’Brien-Fleming boundary is crossed at any of the interim analyses 
(first interim analysis: p=0.008; second interim analysis: p=0.022).

0.008, 0.022, and 0.042 for the first, second, and the final look at the 
data, respectively.  The decision to stop the trial at the interim analyses 
will be based on crossing the rejection boundaries provided above.  
The actions described below will be taken if: 
1)  The lower limit of the one-sided (1-α)% CI does not exceed 0.757 
in the first or second interim analysis, the study will continue as 
planned. 
2)  The lower limit of the one-sided (1-α)% CI exceeds 0.757, then 
All CRF data will be collected for the patients that comprised the 
interim analysis. 
All secondary analyses will be conducted.

If the results of the secondary analyses confirm that treatment with 
DOXIL/CAELYX produces a favorable outcome compared to 
topotecan treatment, the following change in study design will occur:  
Patients currently in the treatment phase who were randomized to 
receive the topotecan regimen may, at the discretion of the 
investigator, being to receive treatment with DOXIL/CAELYX

also be presented. In addition, response rates will also be calculated as 
a supplemental analysis to support the primary efficacy parameter 
results.  Response rates for each of the enrollment stratum will be 
calculated.  Treatment group differences will be tested using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for platinum-
sensitivity and bulky disease. 
The interim analyses may also include an analysis of HQL data and 
quality-adjusted survival time.

8.8 Additional Analyses  
 
As stated in the protocol, the end of planned treatment analysis was the final 
formal analysis to be conducted on Doxil Protocol 30-49.  However the 
analyses conducted for this report yielded results that could be clarified by 
additional analyses.  While the overall survival time did not differ between the 
Doxil and topotecan groups, there was a statistically significant survival 
advantage for Doxil in the subgroup of platinum sensitive patients.  At the time 
of data cutoff for this planned end of treatment report, over 50 % of the 
platinum sensitive patients were still alive.  ALZA will conduct an additional set 
of survival and progression free survival analyses when 90% of the patients 
have either died or been lost to follow-up.  These analyses will be for the 
purpose of assessing whether the survival advantage in the platinum sensitive 
group sustained, and examining the overall survival differences between the 
Doxil and topotecan groups. 
 
Rationale: These analyses will be for the purpose of assessing whether the survival 
advantage in the platinum sensitive group sustained, and examining the overall 
survival differences between the Doxil and topotecan groups.
