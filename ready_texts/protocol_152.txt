Objectives and Variables 

 

Objective 
To compare gefitinib with carboplatin / paclitaxel 
doublet chemotherapy given as first line treatment 
in terms of symptom improvement 
Exploratory Objectives 
To compare gefitinib with carboplatin / paclitaxel 
doublet chemotherapy given as first line treatment 
in terms of health care resource use in a subset of 
patients 
To investigate baseline biomarker data to ascertain 
if there are any biomarkers that differentiate for a 
relative treatment effect when comparing 
randomised treatment arms.   
 

Outcome Variable 
Symptom improvement as measured by the 
Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS) of the FACT-L 
questionnaire 
 
Health care resource use including: inpatient 
hospital visits, outpatient visits, emergency 
room visits, major medical procedures. 

Biomarkers as below: 
- Expression, activation and dimerisation of 
EGFR and other HER family receptors and 
associated pathways including downstream 
signalling pathways 
- Somatic (non-inheritable) mutation and copy 
number analyses of genes of the ErbB family, 
their signalling pathways and associated 
pathways which are thought to be influenced by 
gefitinib in tumour cells 
- RNA expression profile (including candidate 
marker genes).  
 

 

Study design 
This is an open-label, randomised, multicentre Phase III study.  Patients will be randomised to 
receive either gefitinib followed by carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy (Arm A) or 
carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy (Arm B) in a 1:1 ratio.   

Patients will continue on their randomised first line treatment (gefitinib or carboplatin / 
paclitaxel) until objective progression of disease (PD) is documented or discontinuation of 
treatment for other reason (eg, toxicity, patient refusal).  Upon objective PD or cessation of 
first line treatment, patients will continue to be followed for survival.  Patients progressing on 
the gefitinib arm will receive carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy as second line 
study treatment. 

Following progression on carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy in either arm, 
subsequent care and treatment is at the discretion of the treating physician. All subsequent 
chemotherapy, radiation, surgical or other anti-cancer treatments are to be recorded for both 
arms until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent or final data cut-off for 
analysis.

A retrospective independent review of scans used in the assessment of tumours by RECIST 
criteria may be conducted. Tumour assessment scans, including unscheduled visit images (CT, 
MRI, plain x-ray), may be collected and a Contract Research Organisation (CRO) appointed 
to perform central review. The central review may be used in supplementary analyses for 
RECIST based study endpoints. 
Target patient population 
This study will recruit male or female never smokers (defined as having smoked less than 100 
cigarettes in their lifetime [Park JY et al 2000]) or light ex-smokers (defined as having ceased 
smoking at least 15 years before Day 1 of study treatment and having smoked 10 pack-years 
or fewer) aged 18 years or older with a World Health Organization (WHO) Performance 
Status (PS) 0-2, and measurable disease according to RECIST criteria.  Patients must have 
histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (Stage IIIB, not curable with surgery or 
radiotherapy, or Stage IV) adenocarcinoma lung, and not have received any previous 
chemotherapy excluding post operative non-platinum based adjuvant chemotherapy. 

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration 
Gefitinib 250 mg once daily in oral tablet form, administered continuously. 

Comparator, dosage and mode of administration 

Carboplatin AUC 5.0 or 6.0 on day 1 every 3 weeks 

And 

Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks 

Duration of treatment 
Gefitinib will be administered daily until objective PD or other criteria for discontinuation are 
met.  Second line carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy should be administered for a 
maximum of 6 cycles 

First line carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy should be administered for a 
maximum of 6 cycles.  Chemotherapy will be discontinued if there is objective PD or other 
criteria for discontinuation are met.  Patients who complete chemotherapy cycles without 
documented objective PD should continue to attend clinic visits and tumour assessments until 
PD is documented.   

If patients are not able to receive their allocated first line treatment for any reason other than 
objective PD (e.g., AEs, worsening Performance Status or worsening of disease-related 
symptoms without radiological changes that qualify for PD by RECIST criteria) they must 
continue to undergo tumour assessment until objective PD is documented.  Survival follow-up 
will begin upon documentation of PD.  All subsequent chemotherapy, radiation, surgical or 
other anti-cancer therapy are to be recorded until death.

Outcome variables 
See objectives and variables table above for outcome variables. 

Statistical methods 
The primary statistical analysis will be performed in the ITT population and will compare the 
PFS between first line gefitinib and first line carboplatin / paclitaxel using a proportional 
hazards model adjusted for performance status (0-1 vs 2), smoking history (never vs light ex-
smoker), and gender.  The hazard ratio (gefitinib: carboplatin/paclitaxel) will be estimated 
together with its 95% confidence interval and p-value.  The null hypothesis of survival 
inferiority will be rejected and non-inferiority will be concluded if the upper 95% confidence 
limit lies below 1.2. 

If the null hypothesis of progression-free survival inferiority is rejected and if the upper 95% 
confidence limit for the hazard ratio lies below 1.0 then superior PFS for gefitinib will be 
declared. 

Overall survival on gefitinib followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel compared to 
carboplatin/paclitaxel will also be analysed in the same manner.  The confidence interval for 
the hazard ratio will be examined to determine what survival differences can and cannot be 
ruled out.   

1212 patients will be randomised and followed for progression free survival until 944 
progression events have occurred.  Using this number of events would give 80% power at the 
5% 2-sided significance level to conclude non-inferiority.  The patients will then continue to 
be followed up for survival until 944 deaths have occurred.

INTRODUCTION 

Background 

1.1 
Globally, lung cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with an estimated 
worldwide incidence of lung cancer in 2002 of 1.35 million, accounting for 1.18 million 
deaths.  In Eastern Asia alone it affected approximately 488700 patients and accounted for 
417700 deaths (GLOBOCAN 2002: Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide 
[database online]). 

The majority (approximately 80%) of all lung cancer cases are of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) histology (Landis SH et al 1999) and surgery offers the best chance of cure 
(Mountain CF et al 2000).  However, despite surgery significant numbers of patients still 
relapse with systemic disease and the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy provides a modest 
4% increase in overall survival (Hotta K et al 2004).  In addition, forty to fifty per cent of lung 
cancer cases are diagnosed at a stage that is not amenable to curative surgery, with either 
locally advanced or distant metastatic disease.  The median survival for advanced Stage IIIB 
or newly-diagnosed Stage IV NSCLC patients is approximately 7 to 8 months with 
chemotherapy, while the one-year survival rate is 35% (Ginsberg RJ et al 1997). 

Platinum-based chemotherapy has become established as the standard first-line treatment for 
advanced NSCLC with improvements in survival demonstrated over best supportive care 
(27% reduction in the risk of death equivalent to an absolute improvement in survival of 10% 
at one year and increased median survival of 1.5 months [Non-small Cell Lung Cancer 
Collaborative Group 1995]).  Carboplatin / paclitaxel has emerged as one of the most 
commonly used regimens in first-line therapy.  However, the prognosis in advanced NSCLC 
remains extremely poor; approximately one-third of newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC 
patients never receive any chemotherapy, likely to be a reflection of the fact that prognosis 
with chemotherapy remains poor and the side effect profile is intolerable and/or unacceptable 
to patients (IRESSA™ Marketing Opportunity Assessment 2004). 

Gefitinib is a novel agent designed to target signalling through the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR), and has demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with advanced NSCLC 
after failure of prior chemotherapy (Fukuoka M et al 2003, Kris MG et al 2003, Thatcher N et 
al 2005).  Use of EGFR-TKIs concurrently with standard chemotherapy in the first-line setting 
has not demonstrated any efficacy benefit in four large Phase III Studies (Gatzemeier U et al 
2004; Giaccone G et al 2004; Herbst RS et al 2004a, Herbst RS et al 2004b).  Experience with 
gefitinib as first-line monotherapy in Taiwan and Korea has shown promising antitumour 
activity (Chang GC et al 2005, Lee DH et al 2005).  However, gefitinib has not yet been 
evaluated as first-line therapy in Phase III studies. 

Gefitinib has a well established, generally mild side effect profile in comparison with the 
severe burden of toxicity associated with standard chemotherapy.  The tolerability profile for 
gefitinib is characterised by generally low grade, reversible, non-cumulative diarrhoea and 
skin reactions.  In contrast, toxicities associated with chemotherapy agents used to treat

NSCLC, eg, neuropathy, myelosuppression and other haematological toxicity, are not reported 
with gefitinib. 

For detailed safety information see the current Investigator Brochure. 

Rationale 

1.2 
Clinical results from Study 0709 (ISEL) (a large, placebo-controlled study in patients with 
previously treated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC) identified certain subgroups of 
patients, in particular non-smokers and patients of Asian racial origin, who derive greater 
clinical benefit from gefitinib therapy.  This finding is consistent with the Phase II data for 
gefitinib, extensive published literature for gefitinib and data from the BR-21 study of another 
EGFR TKI erlotinib (Tsao MS et al 2005).  The explanation for the increased efficacy in these 
subgroups is unknown.  However, the design of this study reflects these consistent findings in 
terms of the patient population selected.  It is recognized that further advances in the 
understanding of the molecular biology have the potential to better select or predict those 
patients who would benefit beyond, or in addition to, clinical characteristics.  Therefore, the 
collection of tumour samples for biomarker analysis will be an important component of the 
current study. 

This study has been designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of gefitinib compared to 
standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced adenocarcinoma lung in a selected 
population of patients most likely to derive benefit from gefitinib therapy.  Through study of 
the molecular biology, the study aims to identify those patients or patient sub-populations 
most likely to benefit as well as those unlikely to benefit from treatment with gefitinib.

STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 

Overall study design and flow chart 

3.1 
This Clinical Study Protocol has been subjected to a peer review according to AstraZeneca 
standard procedures. 

This is an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, Phase III study comparing gefitinib to 
carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIB or stage IV 
adenocarcinoma lung in the first-line setting.  A total of 1212 patients (606 per treatment 
group) are expected to be randomised during an 20-month recruitment.  Patients will be 
recruited by investigational centres throughout Asia (approximately 75 centres in total).  It is 
estimated that approximately 200 patients will be recruited in Japan, approximately 300 
patients in China and approximately 712 patients will be recruited from elsewhere in Asia.  

This study will recruit male or female never smokers defined as having smoked less than 100 
cigarettes in their lifetime (Park JY et al 2000) or light ex-smokers (defined as having ceased 
smoking at least 15 years before Day 1 of study treatment and having smoked 10 pack-years 
or fewer) aged 18 years or older with a World Health Organization (WHO) Performance 
Status (PS) 0-2, and measurable disease according to RECIST criteria.  Patients must have 
histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (Stage IIIB, not amenable to local therapy, 
or Stage IV) adenocarcinoma lung, and not have received any previous chemotherapy 
excluding post operative non-platinum based adjuvant chemotherapy.

Drug Substance Gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839)   
Study Code D791AC00007  
Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
All patients will be asked to provide optional tumour samples for biomarker analysis (see 
Appendix D).  

Eligible patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either: 

• 

• 

Arm A, gefitinib 250 mg daily (oral tablet) followed by carboplatin / paclitaxel 
doublet chemotherapy 

or 

Arm B, carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy  

In arm A, gefitinib will be administered daily until objective progressive disease (PD) or other 
criteria for discontinuation are met. It is the protocol intent that, in arm A, patients progressing 
on gefitinib will be treated with carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy.  Investigators 
may, however, decide to treat with another approved therapy of their choice if they feel the 
patient is unsuitable to receive carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy.  

In arm B, first line carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy will be administered for a 
maximum of 6 cycles.  Chemotherapy will be discontinued if objective progressive disease 
(PD) or other criteria for discontinuation is met.  Patients who complete all chemotherapy 
cycles without documented objective PD should continue to attend clinic visits and undergo 
tumour assessments until objective PD is documented. 

Upon documentation of objective PD on first line randomised treatment, all patients will enter 
survival follow-up.  All subsequent chemotherapy, radiation, surgical or other anti-cancer 
therapies are to be recorded until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent or 
final data cut-off for analysis.  

If a patient is not able to receive their allocated first line treatment for any reason other than 
objective PD (eg, worsening Performance Status or symptomatic deterioration without 
radiological changes that qualify for PD by RECIST criteria) they must continue to undergo 
tumour assessments every 42 days (6 weeks) until objective PD is documented.  Survival 
follow-up will begin upon documentation of objective PD. 

Following progression on carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy in either arm A or B, 
further care and treatment is at the discretion of the treating physician. 

The primary objective of this study is to compare gefitinib with carboplatin / paclitaxel 
doublet chemotherapy given as first line treatment in terms of progression free survival in 
selected NSCLC patients. 

The primary analysis of progression free survival will be performed after 944 progression 
events have occurred, which is expected to occur after approximately 6 months of follow-up.  
Extended follow-up for survival outcome is also planned, and all patients will continue to be

followed until 944 patients have died, which is expected to occur after a further 12 months 
approximately.  

One interim analysis is planned after 150 progression events have occurred, which is expected 
to occur after approximately 11 months of recruitment. 

Health care resource use up to disease progression will be collected for health economics 
evaluation in selected markets. 

The study flow chart (Figure 1) demonstrates the study design and the study plans (Table 2 
and Table 3) illustrate the number and timing of planned visits for this study.  The principal 
investigator/sub-investigator should adhere to the study plan, procedures, and perform 
tests/observations in accordance with the protocol.  Any assessments after screening should be 
performed within the window period defined in Table 4.  If the date of the patient’s visit does 
not conform to the scheduled study plan and window period, the investigator must promptly 
consult with the AstraZeneca study team representative, reschedule the visit, and make an 
appropriate record of the decision.   

Tumour assessment using RECIST will be performed at baseline then every 42 days (6 weeks) 
± 7 days (1 week)  from randomisation. It is important to follow the assessment schedule as 
closely as possible.  Patients will be evaluated until progression, and will then be followed for 
survival until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent or final data cut-off for 
analysis. 

Following data cut-off for the primary endpoint (when 944 progression events have occurred) 
data collection will be limited to survival status and subsequent anti-cancer treatments 
collected every 56 days (8 weeks). SAEs will be collected for those patients continuing on 
study treatment or second line treatment provided by the Sponsor. Patients without 
documented objective disease progression at the data cut-off for the primary endpoint, should 
continue to undergo tumour assessments according to local practice until progression is 
identified and recorded in the patient notes. NB tumour assessments should not be recorded in 
the eCRF. See the study plan for full details. 

Following data cut-off for the survival endpoint (when 944 deaths have occurred), data 
collection will be limited to SAEs for those patients continuing on study treatment or second 
line treatment provided by the Sponsor. SAE’s occurring between the data cut off and the end 
of study will be collected on the eCRF.  

A steering committee comprised of participating investigators and AstraZeneca personnel 
(statistician and physician) will be established to oversee the ongoing conduct of this study. 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), which is comprised of a panel of 
experts and opinion leaders who will be independent of AstraZeneca will meet to review the 
interim analysis. The IDMC may also request additional data updates during the course of the 
study.

There are no mandated clinic visits for patients receiving second line carboplatin / paclitaxel study treatment. Survival 
information should be collected every 56 days until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow up or closure of the study 
(after 944 deaths).  Any further anti-cancer treatment(s) are to be collected until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow 
up or final data cut off for analysis (after 944 deaths).  The Statement of Death eCRF should be submitted when a patient has 
died.

Concurrent medications  Prior radiotherapies and chemotherapies should also be collected at baseline.  Concurrent medications should be collected up 
to the end of the 28 day safety follow-up period only. For markets participating in the optional Health Care Resource use sub 
study, concurrent medications must be collected up to either the end of the 28 day safety follow-up OR the date of 
progression - whichever is latest. 
If assessments were performed within 7 days prior to the first dose of randomisation treatment and the patient meets the 
eligibility criteria, these assessments do not need to be repeated during visit 2. 
Including height, weight, heart rate, temperature, blood pressure and respiratory system exam. Arterial oxygen pressure and 
pulse oximetry may be performed according to local practice. The only physical examination / vital signs data that will be 
collected in the eCRF is weight at screening. Performance status will be assessed at screening only and will be collected in  
the eCRF. 
Laboratory/vital sign abnormalities should not be reported as adverse events (AEs) unless any criterion for a serious adverse 
event (SAE) is fulfilled, the laboratory/vital signs abnormality causes the patient to discontinue from study treatment, or  the 
investigator insists the abnormality should be reported as an AE.   
Clinical Chemistry, including creatinine clearance calculated from serum creatinine by Cockcroft-Gault formula or 24 hour 
urine collection (according to local practice), should be performed at screening and every 21 days until day 127, then every 
42 days until objective progressive disease (PD) or other criteria for discontinuation is met. 
Haematology assessments required are platelets, ANC, WBC, and Haemoglobin. Patients receiving warfarin or coumarin 
derivatives should also have an INR assessment performed at screening and subsequently as clinically indicated. 
Assessments should be conducted at screening, randomisation (day 1), day 8 and day 15, then every 21 days and 31 days 
calculated from day 1 until day 127, then every 42 days until  objective progressive disease (PD) or other criteria for 
discontinuation is met. For both arms, any abnormal levels should be followed up to resolution. 
Urinalysis is to be performed as part of the screening visit.  This procedure needs only to be repeated if clinically indicated 
or if 24 hour urine collection is to be used to calculate creatinine clearance. 
Pre-menopausal women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to 
randomisation.  In the event of suspected pregnancy during the study, the test should be repeated.  If the results are positive, 
AstraZeneca must be notified immediately. 
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is to be performed as part of the screening visit. This procedure needs only to be repeated if 
clinically indicated. 
A CT scan should be performed at screening to assess for any evidence of  pulmonary fibrosis. The CT performed for 
tumour assessment can be used for this assessment. Subsequent CT scans/X-rays should be performed as clinically indicated

Baseline tumour 
assessment  

The baseline assessment must be able to adequately define all areas of disease.  The specific imaging modality should be a 
CT or a MRI scan and should include chest and upper abdomen, extending to the liver and adrenal glands (see Appendix C).  
This assessment does not need to be repeated if it is performed within 21 days prior to the start of study treatment, unless the 
investigator has a reason to believe that there has been a change in the patient’s tumour burden.  If imaging is repeated 
before the start of study treatment, the most recent assessment would then be recorded as the screening tumour assessment. 
Tumour assessments should be performed every 42 days calculated from visit 2, with a window of +/- 7 days.  The same 
imaging modality as used during screening (baseline) should be utilized and should include chest and upper abdomen, 
extending to the liver and adrenal glands.  The RECIST criteria must be followed (see Appendix C).  Any other areas in 
which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  Any patient who discontinues study treatment for 
reasons other than objective PD must continue to have post baseline tumour assessments as protocolled. 
Tumour sample collection is optional but should be done whenever possible. Details of sample requirements and collection 
are documented in Appendix D 
Patients randomised to receive gefitinib must begin taking study drug within 72 hours (to allow for weekends).  Gefitinib 
will be dispensed every 3 months.  
QoL will be collected at randomisation (Visit 2), day 8 (Visit 3), day 22 (Visit 5) and at 21 day intervals until day 127.  QoL 
will continue to be collected every 42 days during pre-progression follow up. In order to minimise inconvenience to the 
patient QoL may be scheduled to take place at the same time as the RECIST assessments during pre progression follow up. 
QoL will be collected at discontinuation.   
In participating markets, RUSE will be collected at day 22 (Visit 5) and at 21 day intervals until day 127 and then every 42 
days thereafter until disease progression.   It is not necessary to collect RUSE at screening or randomisation.  
AEs and SAEs must be collected from the time informed consent is obtained.  Any ongoing AE or SAE at discontinuation of 
first line gefitinib study treatment and during 28 day follow-up period must be monitored until resolution.  Patients who 
receive second line paclitaxel / carboplatin study treatment (see Section 3.5.4) should continue to be monitored for safety 
according to normal local practice. Any SAEs for these patients should be reported as described in Section 4.7.1. Following 
the primary analysis data cut off SAEs should continue to be reported until 28 days after discontinuation of study therapy, no 
new non-serious AEs should be collected. 
Second line carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy should be administered every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles.   
Dose modifications and/or delays should be managed according to the scheme in Section 3.10.  
Following progression on carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy or discontinuation for other reasons, further anti-
cancer treatment should be according to local practice (see Section 3.10). All further chemotherapy, radiation, surgical or 
other anti-cancer treatments are to be recorded until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow up or final data cut off for 
analysis (after 944 deaths). 
Upon documentation of objective PD or cessation of first line study therapy for other reasons, survival status should be 
collected every 56 days from progression until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow up or final data cut off for 
analysis (after 944 deaths). This may be collected by telephone contact. 
This assessment will no longer be collected post primary analysis data cut off.

investigator insists the abnormality should be reported as an AE.   
Clinical Chemistry, including creatinine clearance calculated from serum creatinine by Cockcroft-Gault formula or 24 hour 
urine collection (according to local practice), should be performed at screening and on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle.  
Haematology assessments required are platelets, ANC, WBC, and Haemoglobin. Patients receiving warfarin or coumarin 
derivatives should also have an INR assessment performed at screening and subsequently as clinically indicated.. 
Assessments should be conducted weekly for the first cycle of chemotherapy, then on days 1 and 10 for subsequent 
chemotherapy cycles. The last  scheduled haematology assessment for patients on the Carboplatin / paclitaxel is the day 10 
assessment of the last cycle of chemotherapy. For both arms, any abnormal levels should be followed up to resolution. 
Urinalysis is to be performed as part of the screening visit.  This procedure needs only to be repeated if clinically indicated or 
if 24 hour urine collection is to be used to calculate creatinine clearance. 
Pre-menopausal women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to 
randomisation.  In the event of suspected pregnancy during the study, the test should be repeated.  If the results are positive, 
AstraZeneca must be notified immediately. 
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is to be performed as part of the screening visit. This procedure needs only to be repeated if 
clinically indicated. 
A CT scan should be performed at screening to assess for any evidence of  pulmonary fibrosis. The CT performed for tumour 
assessment can be used for this assessment. Subsequent CT scans/X-rays should be performed as clinically indicated 
The baseline assessment must be able to adequately define all areas of disease.  The specific imaging modality should be a

CT or a MRI scan and should include chest and upper abdomen, extending to the liver and adrenal glands (see Appendix C).  
This assessment does not need to be repeated if it is performed within 21 days prior to the start of study treatment, unless the 
investigator has a reason to believe that there has been a change in the patient’s tumour burden.  If imaging is repeated before 
the start of study treatment, the most recent assessment would then be recorded as the screening tumour assessment. 
Tumour assessments should be performed every 42 days calculated from visit 2, with a window of +/- 7 days.  No 
adjustment should be made to this schedule for dose delays.  The same imaging modality as used during screening (baseline) 
should be utilized and should include chest and upper abdomen, extending to the liver and adrenal glands.  The RECIST 
criteria must be followed (see Appendix C).  Any other areas in which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately 
imaged.  Any patient who discontinues study treatment for reasons other than objective PD must continue to have post 
baseline tumour assessments as protocolled. 
Tumour sample collection is optional but should be done whenever possible. Details of sample requirements and collection 
are documented in Appendix D.  
Carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy should be administered every 21 days (one cycle) for a maximum of 6 cycles.   
Dose modifications and/or delays should be managed according to the scheme in Section 3.10. 
QoL will be collected at randomisation (Visit 2), day 8 and day 22 of the first cycle of chemotherapy, then day 22 of each 
subsequent cycle calculated from day of infusion. QoL will be collected at discontinuation.  Patients who do not have 
objective disease progression upon completion of all protocolled cycles of chemotherapy or discontinuation from study 
medication will continue to complete QoL questionnaires at 42 day intervals calculated from the date of the first day of the 
last chemotherapy cycle received.  In order to minimise inconvenience to the patient, QoL completion may be rescheduled to 
take place at the same time as the RECIST assessments during pre progression follow up. 
In participating markets, health care resource use will be collected on day 22 of cycles 1 to 6, calculated from day of 
infusion, thereafter every 42 days until progression.  It is not necessary to collect health care resource use at screening or 
randomisation.   
AEs and SAEs must be collected from the time informed consent is obtained.  Any ongoing AE or SAE at discontinuation 
and during survival follow-up must be monitored until resolution. Following the primary analysis data cut off, SAEs should 
continue to be reported until 28 days after discontinuation of study therapy, no new non-serious AEs should be collected. 
Upon documentation of objective PD or cessation of study therapy for other reasons, further anti-cancer treatment should be 
according to local practice (see Section 3.5.4). All further chemotherapy, radiation, surgical or other anti-cancer treatments 
are to be recorded until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow up or final data cut off for analysis  (after 944 deaths). 
Upon documentation of objective PD or cessation of study therapy for other reasons, survival status should be collected 
every 56 days from progression until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow up or final data cut off for analysis (after 
944 deaths). This may be collected by telephone contact. 
This assessment will no longer be collected post primary analysis data cut off.

Unscheduled visits 

3.1.2 
As per Section 3.10 and Table 4, patients on the carboplatin / paclitaxel arm may attend for a 
scheduled treatment visit but have treatment delayed for up to 14 days due to toxicity.  This 
should be considered as an unscheduled visit, and assessments recorded on the appropriate 
Unscheduled Visit eCRFs, ie the scheduled visit will be delayed in line with treatment.  If the 
patient resumes carboplatin / paclitaxel within 14 days, the dosing visit should be considered 
as the next scheduled visit and all eCRFs completed accordingly. 

Rationale and risk/benefit assessment  
Rationale for study design, doses and control groups 

3.2 
3.2.1 
The design of this study meets standard criteria according to ICH guidance for robust trial 
design, namely, randomisation, and the inclusion of standard therapy as the control group.  
Blinding is not feasible due to differences in the method of administration of the two treatment 
regimens. 

32(86) 

Revised Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839)   
Study Code D791AC00007  
Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
Platinum-based chemotherapy has become established as the standard first-line treatment for 
advanced NSCLC with no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of one regimen over 
another (Kelly K et al 2001, Schiller JH et al 2002).  Carboplatin / paclitaxel has emerged as 
one of the most commonly used regimens, including wide use across Asia , and has 
consequently been chosen as the comparator for this study, at doses considered to be 
appropriate for this population (Kubota K et al 2004). 

Standard anti-tumour efficacy variables for advanced NSCLC studies are included in the study 
design (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products 2003).  The primary endpoint for the 
study is progression-free survival (PFS).  It is acknowledged that survival is the key clinical 
outcome in the treatment of first-line NSCLC.  Within the proposed clinical study, long-term 
follow-up is planned to collect survival outcome.  However, the interpretation of overall 
survival will be confounded by the additional treatments patients are expected to receive 
following progression of their disease.  A prolongation of PFS time is a clinically meaningful 
outcome representing a direct benefit to the patient.  Therefore, progression-free survival has 
been chosen as a clinically meaningful outcome measure that is largely unaffected by the 
effects of subsequent therapy.  Evaluation of safety, quality of life and symptoms will also be 
of importance in this treatment setting if gefitinib 250 mg is shown to be no worse than 
chemotherapy in terms of PFS. 

The inclusion and exclusion criteria reflect the intention to recruit a selected study population 
from Asian countries with adenocarcinoma lung who have either never smoked or were 
previously light smokers.  The ability to predict the subgroup of patients who rapidly, 
dramatically and durably benefit from gefitinib therapy while avoiding the side effects of 
conventional therapy is an area of active translational and clinical research as clinicians and 
researchers seek to optimise therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC.  The clinical results 
from Study 0709 and the Phase II studies of gefitinib identified certain subgroups of patients, 
in particular non-smokers and patients of Asian racial origin, who derive greater clinical 
benefit from gefitinib therapy.  The inclusion of patients who were previously light smokers 
has also been allowed based on data from Study 0709 and the published literature (Pham D et 
al 2005, Sugio K at el 2005) suggesting that the favourable biological factors associated with a 
response to gefitinib is related to the amount of exposure to smoke, with the benefit 
decreasing as smoke exposure increased. 

A non-inferiority design has been chosen because it is of interest to show gefitinib is at least 
as effective as chemotherapy given the side effect profile of gefitinib is modest and non-life 
threatening in comparison with the severe burden of toxicity associated with standard 
chemotherapy. The non-inferiority limit chosen for PFS is a hazard ratio of 1.2, which 
translates to up to 1 month shortfall on gefitinib if the PFS on carboplatin/paclitaxel is 6 
months.  This was felt to be the maximum shortfall that would be acceptable taking into 
account the potential advantages of a generally well tolerated oral agent compared to standard 
intravenous chemotherapy.  For overall survival, given the relatively short life expectancy of 
this population of patients, a shortfall greater than 7 weeks was felt to be clinically significant 
given that chemotherapy is offered despite only relatively modest improvements in overall 
survival compared to BSC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group 1995).

To ensure no patients are denied the current standard of care, carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet 
chemotherapy will be provided following discontinuation of gefitinib.  This will allow an 
evaluation of the relative effect on overall survival of introducing gefitinib before doublet 
chemotherapy compared to initiating treatment with doublet chemotherapy.  Subsequent 
treatment following discontinuation of chemotherapy is at the investigator’s discretion to 
minimise any differences in post-chemotherapy failure treatment between the randomised 
groups. 

Risk/benefit and ethical assessment 

3.2.2 
Gefitinb has a favourable safety profile in advanced NSCLC patients and is generally well 
tolerated.  It is not typically associated with cytotoxic adverse events.   

AEs tend to be predictable and manageable, and are generally reversible and non-cumulative, 
with the most common AEs being rash-type events and diarrhoea.  Notably, in a large placebo 
controlled phase 3 study (Study 0709), there was little difference between the treatment arms 
in terms of the frequency of reporting SAEs, CTC Grade 3 or 4 events, and AEs leading to 
death.  No safety concerns were raised in special populations.  The AE profile in study 0709 is 
consistent with the established safety profile for gefitinib.  The data from this large phase III 
placebo controlled study confirm the favourable tolerability profile of gefitinib in advanced 
NSCLC.   

In study 0709, gefitinib was associated with some improvement in overall survival relative to 
placebo, although the magnitude of this improvement was less than anticipated and 
consequently failed to reach statistical significance.  Despite this, the likelihood that this 
increase in overall survival was due to a true effect of gefitinib was 95.6%.  In pre-planned 
subgroup analyses, study 0709 demonstrated a significant survival improvement for patients 
receiving gefitinib therapy compared with placebo for never-smokers of tobacco and also for 
patients of Asian origin.  Median overall survival was prolonged by 2.8 months in never-
smokers of tobacco (from 6.1 months for patients receiving placebo to 8.9 months for 
gefitinib-treated patients) and by 4.0 months in patients of Asian origin (from 5.5 months to 
9.5 months).

Discontinuation of patients from study treatment or assessment and 
termination from study 

Definitions 
Discontinuation from study treatment is when a patient no longer receives study medication 
but continues to be followed up for progression or for survival. 

Termination from study is when no further study assessments will be performed and no 
further data, including survival data, will be collected.  

It is important to determine the wishes of the patient to differentiate between discontinuation 
from study medication or assessments or termination from the study when consent is 
withdrawn. 

3.3.5.1  Criteria for discontinuation from study treatment  
Patients may be discontinued from study treatment and assessments at any time.  Specific 
reasons for discontinuing a patient from study treatment in this study are: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Patient has received maximum number of protocolled carboplatin / paclitaxel 
cycles. 

Dose delay or interruption for > 14 days 

Symptomatic deterioration as judged by the investigator 

Voluntary discontinuation by the patient who is at any time free to withdraw from 
study treatment or assessments, without prejudice to further treatment

considered to involve any risk or discomfort to the patient. 

3.3.5.2  Criteria for termination from study 
Patients may terminate the study at any time.  Specific reasons for termination from the 
treatment phase of the study are:  

• 

• 

• 

Voluntary withdrawal by the patient who is at any time free to terminate his/her 
participation in the study, without prejudice to further treatment 

Patient lost to follow-up 

Death 

In addition to the above, patients will terminated from study during the screening phase for: 

• 

Incorrect enrolment (ie, the patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion 
criteria) of the study, 

and may be terminated during the screening phase for: 

• 

Safety reasons as judged by the investigator and/or AstraZeneca 

3.3.5.3  Criteria for termination from biomarker research aspects of the study 
A patient may withdraw from the biomarker research aspects of the study at any time, 
independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study 
described in this protocol.  Voluntary withdrawal by the patient will not prejudice further 
treatment. See Appendix D for details. 

3.3.5.4  Procedures for discontinuation from study treatment 
Patients who discontinue from first line study treatment should always be asked about the 
reason(s) for their discontinuation and the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they should be 
seen and assessed by an investigator.  AEs should be followed up,  Quality of Life (QoL) (and 
Resource Use (RUSE) questionnaires where applicable) completed and investigational 
products should be returned by the patient.  The investigator should immediately notify 
AstraZeneca of a patient’s discontinuation from first line study treatment.

Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
All patients who have CTCAE grade 3 or 4 laboratory values at the time of discontinuation 
from first line study treatment must have further tests performed.  The results are to be 
recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) when the laboratory values 
have returned to the baseline CTCAE grade, unless these values are not likely to improve 
because of the underlying disease.  In these cases, the investigators must record their opinions 
in the patient’s medical records.  Laboratory abnormalities should not be reported as adverse 
events unless any criterion for a serious adverse event (SAE) is fulfilled, the laboratory 
abnormality causes the patient to discontinue from the study, or the investigator insists the 
abnormality should be reported as an AE. Following the primary analysis data cut off no 
further laboratory assessments should be added to the eCRF. 

Upon discontinuation from first line study treatment all on-going AEs and SAEs must be 
followed until resolution, unless in the investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to 
resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease.  

After discontinuation from first line study treatment, patients must be followed up for any new 
AEs for 28 calendar days after the last dose of study drug.  All new AEs occurring during this 
28 calendar day period must be recorded (if SAEs they must be reported to AstraZeneca 
within 24 hours) and followed up for resolution as above. Following the primary analysis data 
cut off SAEs should continue to be reported until 28 days after discontinuation of study 
therapy, no new non-serious AEs should be collected.   

Any patient who discontinues from first line study treatment for reasons other than objective 
PD should continue, where possible, to undergo objective tumour assessments every 42 days 
(6 weeks) in order to collect information on progression of disease.  These patients should also 
be followed up for QoL and RUSE every 42 days until objective PD. When objective PD has 
been documented, follow up information for survival should be collected at least every 
56 days (8 weeks) by contact with the patient, patient’s family, or by contact with the patient’s 
current physician. Telephone contact is allowed. All subsequent chemotherapy, radiation, 
surgical or other anti-cancer therapies are to be recorded until death, loss to follow-up, 
withdrawal of informed consent or final data cut-off for analysis.  

Patients without documented objective disease progression at the data cut-off for the primary 
endpoint, should continue to undergo tumour assessments according to local practice until 
progression is identified and recorded in the patient notes. NB tumour assessments should not 
be recorded in the eCRF. No further QoL or RUSE assessments should take place. The 
survival follow-up phase for these patients will commence following the primary analysis data 
cut off. 

Patients in arm A discontinuing from second line carboplatin / paclitaxel study treatment must 
be followed up for any new SAEs for 28 calendar days after the last dose of study drug.  All 
new SAEs occurring during this 28 calendar day period must be reported to AstraZeneca 
within 24 hours and followed up for resolution.  All on-going SAEs must be followed until 
resolution, unless in the investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the 
patient’s underlying disease.

3.4 
3.4.1 
Eligible patients will receive either gefitinib (arm A) or carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet 
chemotherapy (arm B) as first line study treatment.  Patients in arm A will be treated with 
carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy as second line therapy.  Investigators may, 
however, decide to treat with another approved therapy of their choice if they feel the patient 
is unsuitable to receive second line carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy.   

(a) 

Gefitinib 

AstraZeneca will supply gefitinib to the investigator as brown, film-coated, round shaped 
tablets for use as 250-mg tablets (formulation number 
gefitinib can be found in the IB. 

).  Descriptive information for 

Tablets will be packed in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child-resistant 
closures.  Each bottle of gefitinib will contain 100 tablets sufficient for 12 weeks.  Gefitinib 
will be dispensed to the patient in the AstraZeneca packing provided.  The packaging includes 
bottles, caps, and a label.  Bottle tampers should not be broken prior to dispensing study drug 
to a patient. 

(b) 

Chemotherapy 

Carboplatin and paclitaxel are manufactured and available commercially.  Descriptive 
information can be found in the approved product labelling.  AstraZeneca will provide 
carboplatin / paclitaxel according to normal local practice for use in this protocol.

Doses and treatment regimens 

Gefitinib 

The gefitinib dose level for this study is 250 mg daily.  One tablet of gefitinib will be taken at 
each administration, about the same time everyday, with or without food.  If the patient 
forgets to take a dose, they should take the last missed dose as soon as they remember, as long 
as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose is due. 

Study treatment will be dispensed to patients on Day 1 and every 84 days (12 weeks) 
thereafter during the treatment period until the patient has documented objective PD or other

criteria for discontinuation are met as described in Section 3.3.5.  Patients randomised to 
receive gefitinib should begin taking their study treatment within 72 hours of randomisation.  

(b) 

Carboplatin / paclitaxel 

Patients will receive paclitaxel 200mg/m2 intravenous (iv) over 3 hours on Day 1, 
immediately followed by carboplatin AUC 5.0 or 6.0 IV over 15-60 minutes, repeated in 
cycles of  3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles. Patients should begin their first line study treatment 
within 72 hours of randomisation. The dose of carboplatin will be based on the Calvert 
Formula, and the Cockroft-Gault formula or 24 hour urine collection for creatinine clearance 
may substitute for the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the Calvert formula. 

Cockcroft-Gault Formula:  

 

 

 
 

 

 

Males: creatinine clearance = (140 – patient’s age) x (patient’s weight in kilograms) 
 

         72 x patient’s serum creatinine in mg/dl  

   

 

 

Females: Multiple the result from the equation by 0.85

Labelling 

3.4.3 
Each package of gefitinib will have an investigational-use label permanently affixed to the 
outside and will be clearly marked as per market specific local regulations, stating that the 
drug is for clinical study use only and should be kept out of the reach of children.  Instructions 
stating that the tablets should be taken as a single dose orally at the same time each day will be 
included. 

Package labels will include the study number and caution and dosing instructions.  Bottle 
labels will also contain blank lines for the patient’s enrolment code (E-code) and the date the 
bottle is dispensed.  The investigator should record this information at the time the bottle is 
dispensed.  Each label will also include a tear-off portion that should be applied to the 
appropriate accountability form upon dispensing.

Gefitinib must be kept in a secure place under appropriate storage conditions.  A description 
of the appropriate storage and shipment conditions are specified on the investigational product 
bottle label and in the IB. 

Storage 
Gefitinib 

Carboplatin and paclitaxel  

(b) 
Carboplatin and paclitaxel should be stored in accordance with the approved product labelling.   

Accountability 

3.4.5 
It is the investigator’s/institution’s responsibility to establish a system for handling study 
treatment so as to ensure that: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Deliveries of such products from AstraZeneca are correctly received by a 
responsible person (eg, a pharmacist) 

Deliveries are recorded 

The drug is prescribed only by the investigator or co-investigators named in the 
delegation of responsibility log 

Study treatments are handled and stored safely and properly 

Study treatments are dispensed only to study patients in accordance with the 
protocol 

Patients must return all unused medication and empty containers to the investigator 

At the end of the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage 
and destroyed/returned stock.  Any discrepancies must be accounted for.  Certificates of 
delivery and return must be signed, preferably by the investigator or a pharmacist. 

After drug accountability has been completed by the study monitor, all unused or returned 
study drug should be sent for destruction as per local regulations.  

(a) 

Gefitinib drug accountability  

Each time a bottle of gefitinib is dispensed to a patient, the individual dispensing the study 
drug should enter the date and the patient’s E-code on the tear-off portion of the label, attach 
the label to the patient drug accountability form, and initial the relevant box on the form.  
Patient drug accountability forms will be checked by the monitor. 
(b) 
Each time chemotherapy is administered to a patient, the administrator should complete the 
date of administration, the chemotherapeutic products administered, dosage, and product lot

numbers on the appropriate eCRF.  All pre-medications administered should also be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF. 

Guideline for dispersing whole gefitinib tablet(s) 

3.4.6 
The tablet should not be crushed.  Experimentation has shown that a gefitinib tablet will break 
up into a fine dispersion within 10 to 15 minutes when it is dropped whole into drinking water 
at room temperature.  The dispersion is chemically stable providing this process occurs 
immediately prior to administration to or by the patient.   

The following procedure is recommended for administering a dispersed whole tablet to 
patients who are unable to swallow: 

Procedure 
Drop the gefitinib tablet into an appropriate container (ideally glass to help confirm removal 
of all the dispersed material) containing approximately 50 mL of drinking water (or water for 
injection or purified water) at room temperature.  Stir the liquid occasionally to ensure 
complete break-up of the tablet.  When the tablet has broken up into a fine dispersion 
(approximately 10 to 15 minutes) it can be administered.   

To ensure delivery of the whole dose, rinse the container with a similar amount of drinking 
water (or water for injection or purified water)  to ensure removal of any material adhering to 
the walls of the container and administer the additional fluid to the patient.  Administration to 
the patient should occur immediately after dispersion is complete. 

Method of assigning patients to treatment groups 

3.5 
Patient eligibility will be established before treatment randomisation.  Patients will be 
randomised strictly sequentially, as patients are eligible for randomisation.  If a patient is 
terminated from the study, the patient number will not be reused, and the patient will not be 
allowed to re-enter the study. 

Screening 

3.5.1 
As patients are screened for the study they must be allocated an E-code.  The E-code is a 7 
digit number made up of the centre number and the patient number within that particular 
centre eg, the first patient screened at centre number 0025 would be assigned the E-code 
E0025001, the second patient screened would be E0025002 and so on.  This number is the 
patient’s unique identifier and is used to identify the patient on the eCRFs.  All screened 
patients are assigned an E-code irrespective of whether or not they are subsequently 
randomised to receive study treatment. 

Randomisation 

3.5.2 
Eligible patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either: 

• 

Arm A, gefitinib followed by carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy 

43(86) 

Revised Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839)   
Study Code D791AC00007  
Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 

or 

• 

Arm B, carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy 

Once a patient’s eligibility has been confirmed, the investigator (or nominated assistant) 
should contact the Randomisation Centre by telephone for the issue of a patient randomisation 
code and allocation of randomised study treatment.  Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 basis 
using dynamic balancing (Pocock SJ et al 1975) with respect to performance status (0-1 vs 2), 
smoking history (never vs light ex-smokers), gender and centre.  The number of light ex-
smokers randomised into the study will be restricted to 25%.   The Randomisation Centre will 
inform the investigator of the patient randomisation number to be allocated.  The patient 
randomisation code will correspond to a randomised treatment allocation. 

Patients must begin their study treatment within 72 hours following the date of randomisation 
(to allow for weekends).  If a patient discontinues from this study, the E-code and 
randomisation number will not be reused. 

Duration of treatment  

3.5.3 
Arm A: 
Gefitinib will be administered daily until objective PD or other criteria for discontinuation is 
met.  If a patient is not able to receive their allocated treatment for reasons other than 
objective PD (eg, worsening Performance Status or worsening of disease-related symptoms 
without radiological changes that qualify for PD by RECIST criteria) they must continue to 
undergo tumour assessments every 42 days (6 weeks) until objective PD is documented.  
These patients should also be followed up for QoL and RUSE every 42 days until objective 
PD.  Survival follow-up will begin upon documentation of objective PD. 

Patients without documented objective disease progression at the data cut-off for the primary 
endpoint, should continue to undergo tumour assessments according to local practice until 
progression is identified and recorded in the patient notes. NB tumour assessments should not 
be recorded in the eCRF. No further QoL or RUSE assessments should take place. The 
survival follow-up phase for these patients will commence following the primary analysis data 
cut off.   

It is the protocol intent that patients progressing on gefitinib will be treated with carboplatin / 
paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy. Carboplatin / paclitaxel will be provided by AstraZeneca 
according to local practice, if started within 90 days of objective disease progression. 
Investigators may, however, decide to treat with another approved therapy of their choice if 
they feel the patient is unsuitable to receive second line carboplatin / paclitaxel.  

If objective disease progression is recorded according to RECIST (Appendix C) but the 
Investigator considers the patient is still deriving clinical benefit, following consultation with 
the AstraZeneca Physician gefitinib may be continued until there is no further clinical benefit.

Supply, labelling, storage dosing, and accountability of second line carboplatin / paclitaxel 
will be as described in Section 3.4. Second line carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy 
should be administered for a maximum of 6 cycles. Chemotherapy will be discontinued if 
objective PD or other criteria for discontinuation is met. 

There are no protocolled clinic visits for patients receiving second line carboplatin / paclitaxel. 
Patients should continue to be monitored for safety according to normal  local practice. Any 
SAEs for these patients should be reported as described in Section 4.7.1. Upon discontinuation 
of second line anti-cancer therapy, Investigator assessment of best response will be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF. 

Arm B: 
Carboplatin / Paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy should be administered for a maximum of 6 
cycles. Chemotherapy will be discontinued if objective PD or other criteria for discontinuation 
is met.  Patients who complete all planned chemotherapy cycles without documented objective 
PD should continue to attend clinic visits and undergo tumour assessments until objective PD 
is documented.  

Patients without documented objective disease progression at the data cut-off for the primary 
endpoint, should continue to undergo tumour assessments according to local practice until 
progression is identified and recorded in the patient notes. NB tumour assessments should not 
be recorded in the eCRF. No further QoL or RUSE assessments should take place. The 
survival follow-up phase for these patients will commence following the primary analysis data

patients should also be followed up for QoL and RUSE every 42 days until objective PD.  
Survival follow-up will begin upon documentation of objective PD.   

Subsequent anti-cancer therapies 

3.5.4 
Following progression on carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy in either arm, further 
care and treatment is at the discretion of the treating physician. 

Upon discontinuation of second line anti-cancer therapy, Investigator assessment of best 
response will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 

Survival follow-up 

3.5.5 
Follow-up for survival should occur every 56 days (8 weeks) by contact with the patient, the 
patient’s family, or by contact with the patient’s current physician until death or final data cut 
off for analysis.  Telephone contact is allowed.  All subsequent chemotherapy, radiation, 
surgical or other anti-cancer therapies are to be recorded until death, loss to follow-up, 
withdrawal of informed consent or final data cut-off for analysis.

3.7.1 
Except for the study treatments specified in this protocol, no systemic treatment or 
radiotherapy (except for palliative radiotherapy for symptomatic, non-target lesions) known to 
have an effect on NSCLC may be provided while receiving study treatment.  

Bisphosphonates may be used for treatment of bone pain or hypercalcaemia. 

Pre-medication for carboplatin and paclitaxel 

3.7.2 
All pre-medication for first line chemotherapy should be collected in the eCRF 

3.7.2.1  Pre-medication for paclitaxel 
Prior to receiving paclitaxel, it is strongly recommended that patients receive pre-medication 
with: 

• 

• 

• 

Dexamethasone 20 mg orally 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel infusion 

Diphenhydramine 50 mg iv (or equivalent) 1 hour before paclitaxel infusion 

Ranitidine 50 mg or famotidine 20 mg 1 hour before paclitaxel infusion. 

3.7.2.2  Pre-medication for carboplatin 
Prior to receiving carboplatin, it is strongly recommended that patients receive pre-medication 
with intravenous ondansetron or oral medication in this class of antiemetics.  For patients with 
delayed post chemotherapy emesis, follow up oral HT3 antagonists is recommended. 

Other concomitant treatment  

3.7.3 
3.7.3.1  Gefitinib  
No concomitant use of the following items is allowed: phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, 
barbiturates, or St John’s Wort.  These drugs induce cytochrome P450, subfamily IIIA 
(nifedipine oxidase), polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) and may decrease the levels of gefitinib. 

Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, itraconazole) may result in increased levels of 
gefitinib.  This exposure may be clinically relevant since adverse experiences are related to 
dose and exposure.

Study Code D791AC00007  
Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
Co-administration of drugs that cause significant sustained elevations in gastric pH ≥ 5 may 
reduce plasma concentrations of gefitinib and therefore may reduce efficacy.  For further 
information see the current IB.  

Further elevations of International Normalized Ratio (INR) and/or bleeding events have been 
reported in some patients taking warfarin (coumarin derivatives) while on gefitinib.  INR 
monitoring is required for any patient on warfarin (coumarin derivative) treatment, or 
receiving any other product requiring INR monitoring while on this study. 

In vitro studies have shown that gefitinib has limited potential to inhibit cytochrome P450, 
family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6).  In a clinical study in patients, gefitinib was 
co-administered with metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate).  This resulted in a small (35%) 
increase in exposure to metoprolol, which is not considered to be clinically relevant. 

3.7.3.2  Carboplatin and paclitaxel  
The renal effects of nephrotoxic compounds may be potentiated by carboplatin 
(PARAPLATIN® Prescribing Information 2004) 

The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 iso-enzymes CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4.  In the absence of formal clinical drug inter-action studies, caution should be 
exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with known substrates or inhibitors of 
the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. 

3.7.3.3  Both treatment arms 
Other medication, which is considered necessary for the patient’s safety and well-being, may 
be given at the discretion of the investigator(s).  The administration of all medication 
(including investigational products) up to the end of the 28 day safety follow-up period must 
be recorded on the appropriate sections of the eCRFs. Post primary analysis data cut off no 
further concomitant medications should be recorded on the eCRF. NB Anti-cancer therapies 
should continue to be recorded as per usual until the survival analysis data cut off. 

Treatment options post study completion

At the closure of this study, study drug will be provided by AstraZeneca to those patients who 
are still deriving clinical benefit from treatment.

Treatment compliance 

Gefitinib treatment compliance 

Patients will self-administer gefitinib.  The centre designee will query the patient for treatment 
compliance at each visit.  All patients must return the bottle of gefitinib at each scheduled visit 
when a new bottle is dispensed.  The centre designee will conduct a tablet count of any 
remaining tablets in the bottle and will determine if the patient is following their treatment 
dose schedule.  Compliance will be assessed by tablet count and the information will be 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  After the tablet count, the remaining tablets will not be

returned to the patient but will be retained by the centre until reconciliation is completed by 
the study monitor. 

(b) 

Carboplatin and Paclitaxel treatment compliance  

Carboplatin and paclitaxel administration must be documented.  Information including the 
date of administration, dosage, and product lot numbers must be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRFs.   

Management of Toxicity - Gefitinib 

3.9 
In all cases where the gefitinib dose has been interrupted or the patient discontinued due to 
unusual or unusually severe toxicity considered related to gefitinib, the investigator must 
contact the AstraZeneca study physician. 

Gefitinib dose interruption  

3.9.1 
Dose interruptions should be used as the first approach to managing toxicity.  Repeat dose 
interruptions are allowed as required, for a maximum of 14 days on each occasion.  Dose 
reductions are not permitted in this study.   

3.9.2  Management of skin toxicity 
Patients with poorly tolerated skin toxicity may be managed by providing a brief (maximum 
of 14 days) interruption of gefitinib; the daily dose of gefitinib should then be reinstated.  
However, the rash may improve without the need for interrupting gefitinib therapy. 

There is no standard, known or established treatment proven effective for drug-related skin 
rashes or skin changes due to gefitinib.  Most commonly, a pustular rash has been observed, 
which frequently improves even when the same dose of gefitinib therapy is continued 
uninterrupted.   

Investigators have had varying degrees of success with a variety of agents used to manage 
skin rashes.  These include mild to moderate strength steroid creams, either topical or 
systemic antihistamines and occasionally retinoid creams.  The need for oral or topical 
antibiotics is a clinical decision of the investigator and should be preceded by a culture of 
affected areas and, if indicated, a dermatology consultation.  The use of oral steroids for 
dermatological conditions should be discussed with an AstraZeneca study physician.  Dry skin 
can be managed with simple emolients. 

3.9.3  Management of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity 
If gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is not appropriately managed this may be associated with the 
development of dehydration.  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice promptly in 
the event of developing severe or persistent diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or anorexia.

Date 29 January 2010 
3.9.3.1  Nausea and/or vomiting 
In patients who have vomiting and are unable to retain gefitinib, every attempt should be 
made to control the nausea and vomiting.  The dose of gefitinib may be repeated if vomiting 
occurs within 30 minutes of taking the tablet. 

3.9.3.2  Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea has been successfully managed with anti-diarrhoeal agents such as loperamide. 

• 

• 

• 

CTCAE grade 1-2 diarrhoea.  No specific supportive care is usually needed or 
indicated.  Oral fluid intake should be encouraged 

CTCAE grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea.  If this occurs immediate supportive care 
measures should be initiated, gefitinib should be interrupted for up to a maximum of 
14 days until resolution, or the diarrhoea has decreased in severity to CTCAE grade 
1.  If CTCAE grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea recurs, and in the investigator’s opinion cannot 
be controlled by further drug interruptions and optimal symptomatic management, 
then gefitinib should be discontinued. 

If a CTCAE grade 4 diarrhoea is associated with hemodynamic collapse, gefitinib 
should be discontinued, the investigator should notify the AstraZeneca study 
physician, and it should be reported as a SAE. 

Liver transaminases 

3.9.4 
Asymptomatic increases in liver transaminases have been observed.  Gefitinib should be used 
cautiously in the presence of mild to moderate increases of liver transaminases.  
Discontinuation of gefitinib should be considered if the changes are severe. 

Ophthalmology 

3.9.5 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice promptly in the event of developing any eye 
symptoms. 

3.9.6  Management of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including interstitial pneumonitis, is a common complication of 
lung diseases including advanced lung cancer, regardless of treatment.  It has also been widely 
observed in clinical studies in which chemotherapy (incidence generally ranges from 3 to 6%) 
and/or radiotherapy (incidence generally ranges from 10 to 15%) has been used for the 
treatment of advanced lung cancer.   

ILD, which may be acute in onset, has been observed uncommonly in patients treated with 
gefitinib.  These patients usually present with a fairly acute onset of dyspnoea sometimes 
associated with cough or low grade fever.  This may become quite severe within a short period 
of time and usually results in hospitalisation.  Radiological investigations, often including CT 
scan, frequently show pulmonary infiltrates or interstitial shadowing with ground glass 
appearance.  There is often respiratory distress with arterial oxygen de-saturation.  Cultures

are frequently negative for bacterial growth.  In a number of cases, the event has responded to 
steroid therapy but this is not always so and some cases have been fatal.  Patients with 
concurrent idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia, pneumoconiosis, radiation 
pneumonia or drug-induced pneumonia, have been observed to have an increased mortality 
rate from this condition. 

If patients present with an acute worsening or new onset of respiratory symptoms such as 
dyspnoea, cough and fever, gefitinib should be interrupted and the patient promptly 
investigated for ILD.  If ILD is confirmed, gefitinib should be discontinued and the patient 
treated appropriately.   

3.9.6.1  Guidelines for the assessment of patients developing new onset or worsening of 

respiratory symptoms 

If, during the course of the study, a patient develops new onset, or worsening of existing 
respiratory symptoms then gefitinib should be temporarily interrupted and investigations 
undertaken to define the aetiology of these symptoms.  

Clinical investigation (radiological studies and pulmonary function studies) should be strongly 
considered.  Specialist pulmonary consultation should also be considered.  Further clinical 
management will be dictated by the results of these investigations and the patient’s clinical 
condition. 

• 

• 

Clinical presentation and investigations indicate a diagnosis other than ILD:  
patients should receive appropriate therapy, which will vary according to the 
specific diagnosis made (eg, intercurrent infection, progressive disease, pulmonary 
oedema, pulmonary embolus).  Depending on the clinical situation, gefitinib may or 
may not need to be discontinued.  This will be at the discretion of the investigator 
but if there is any uncertainty, the investigator should contact AstraZeneca.  

Clinical presentation and investigations indicate/suggest a diagnosis of ILD: 
gefitinib should be discontinued and an attempt should be made to define the extent 
of and a specific aetiology for the ILD (eg, radiation pneumonitis, viral or fungal 
infections, pulmonary fibrosis).  This is likely to require high resolution CT 
scanning and full pulmonary function testing, with measurement of transfer factor.  
Additional investigations such as bronchoalveolar lavage, trans-bronchial biopsy or 
video assisted trans-thoracic biopsy should also be undertaken if clinically 
appropriate.  Specialist pulmonary consultation is strongly recommended.   

The patient should receive all therapeutic and supportive intervention deemed 
appropriate by the investigator.  The use of corticosteroids should be considered. 

The investigator should contact AstraZeneca within 24 hours to report the ILD as a 
SAE.  Further information will subsequently be collected by AstraZeneca in the 
form of a detailed questionnaire.  This will allow for prospective data collection to 
evaluate the incidence, duration, intensity, and reversibility of episodes of ILD.

• 

Clinical presentation and investigations inconclusive: in this situation, the 
continued administration of gefitinib should be at the discretion of the investigator.  
However, if there is any uncertainty regarding the continuation of study medication, 
the investigator should contact AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca may at their discretion 
collect further information in the form of a detailed questionnaire.   

The patient should be closely monitored for further changes in respiratory 
symptoms, which may indicate the need for additional or repeat investigations 
and/or specialist pulmonary consultation. 

If additional or repeat investigations indicate/suggest a diagnosis of ILD, the patient 
should be managed as described above. 

Other toxicity 

3.9.7 
For any other CTCAE grade 3 or 4 toxicity or any clinically significant lower grade toxicity, 
treatment with gefitinib should be interrupted for a maximum of 14 days until the patient 
recovers completely or the toxicity reverts to CTCAE grade 1 or to the baseline grade. 
Patients requiring dose interruption of > 14 days should be permanently discontinued from 
study treatment (see Section 3.3.5) 

In all cases where the the patient has been withdrawn due to unusual or unusually severe 
toxicity considered related to gefitinib, the investigator must contact the AstraZeneca study 
physician. 

3.10  Management of Toxicity – Carboplatin and Paclitaxel 
The information given below is a recommendation only.  Local practice, prescribing 
information and clinical judgement should be followed for the management of toxicities. 

3.10.1  Hematological toxicity  
The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3 and platelet 
count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/ mm3 to receive chemotherapy on Day 1 of 
each cycle (blood samples must be taken no more than 48 hours prior to dosing, according to 
normal clinical practice). 

Dose modifications should be made according to the criteria specified in Table 5 below.

< 1000/mm3 for >5 
days, <500/mm3 for 
any duration or febrile 
neutropenia of any 
duration 
 
Note: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [filgrastrim] [G-CSF] can be used to treat 
neutropenia, and may be given prophylactically in subsequent cycles according to normal 
local practice.  It should not be given unless neutropenia has already occurred, i.e. should not 
be given prophylactically from cycle 1 to prevent neutropenia occuring in the first place. 

Treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin should be delayed for up to 14 days until the ANC 
on Day 1 of each cycle is greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3 and the platelet count is greater 
than or equal to 100,000/mm3.  Patients and investigators need to be attentive to the possibility 
of fever and infection so that these complications can be promptly and appropriately managed. 

When a dose reduction in paclitaxel or carboplatin is made for decreased ANC, and/or 
decreased platelet count, or febrile neutropenia and the reduced dosage results in no toxicity in 
a subsequent chemotherapy cycle, an attempt should be made to re-escalate the dose in 
subsequent cycles. 

Dose reductions for reduced neutrophils are NOT based on a single nadir count.  The 
neutrophils must remain less than 1,000/mm3 for more than 5 days before a dose reduction is 
made. 

If chemotherapy must be withheld due to haematological toxicity, a complete blood count 
(haemoglobin, white cell count, absolute neutrophils count, and platelets) should be obtained 
at least weekly until the ANC and platelet counts reach the lower limits for treatment as 
outlined.  The treatment schedule will then proceed in the usual sequence. 

No dose reductions will be made for anaemia.  Patients may be supported with packed red cell 
transfusions or erythropoietin at the investigator’s discretion. 

3.10.2  Nausea and/or vomiting  
Nausea and/or vomiting in association with paclitaxel and carboplatin should be controlled 
with adequate antiemetics before administration, and for up to 48 hours following 
administration.  If CTCAE grade 3 or 4 nausea/vomiting occurs in temporal association with 
paclitaxel / carboplatin administration in spite of aggressive anticipatory and/or follow-up 
antiemetics therapy, the dose of paclitaxel / carboplatin should be reduced as specified in 
Table 6 for the next cycle.  A second dose reduction is at the Investigator’s discretion.  If

tolerated, increase paclitaxel / carboplatin back to 100% dose as soon as possible. If CTCAE 
grade 3 or 4 nausea/vomiting persists, treatment should be permanently discontinued.

If paclitaxel is withheld due to hepatic toxicity, carboplatin should also be withheld, and 
administered when the paclitaxel is resumed.  No dose reductions of carboplatin will be made 
for hepatic toxicity. 

3.10.4  Cardiovascular toxicity  
With paclitaxel, cardiac rhythm disturbances within 3 hours of administration have occurred 
infrequently, however, most patients are asymptomatic and cardiac monitoring is not required.  
Transient asymptomatic bradycardia has been noted in as many as 29% of patients.  More 
significant atrioventricular block has rarely been noted.  Cardiac events should be managed as 
follows: 

• 

• 

Asymptomatic, non-persistent bradycardia - no treatment required.  Report as an 
AE. 

Symptomatic arrhythmia - stop paclitaxel infusion, manage arrhythmia according to 
standard practice.  Discontinue study treatment until the arrhythmia is no longer 
present, Report as an AE.  If arrhythmia recurs, study treatment should be 
permanently discontinued and the arrhythmia managed as clinically indicated.

• 

Chest pain and/or symptomatic hypotension (less than 90/60 mmHg or requires 
fluid replacement) - stop paclitaxel infusion.  Perform an ECG. Give intravenous 
diphenhydramine and dexamethasone if hypersensitivity is considered.  Also, 
consider epinephrine or bronchodilators if chest pain is not thought to be cardiac.  
Report as AE.  Study treatment may be discontinued at investigators discretion. 

3.10.5  Neurological toxicity  
Paclitaxel doses should be modified for neurological toxicity (see Table 8).   Serum 
magnesium and calcium levels should be checked; folate and vitamin B6 levels may need to 
be evaluated by the local laboratory, especially in older patients.

Dose modifications made for neurotoxicity are permanent reductions. If paclitaxel is withheld 
due to neurological toxicity, carboplatin should also be withheld, and administered when the 
paclitaxel is resumed.  No dose reductions of carboplatin will be made for neurological 
toxicity. 

3.10.6  Management of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)  
Management of ILD should be as for the gefitinib arm (Section 3.9.6) 

3.10.7  Hypersensitivity to paclitaxel  
Patients who have had a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel have been 
successfully re-challenged, but careful attention to prophylaxis and bedside monitoring of 
vital signs is recommended.  Local practice should be followed and local prescribing 
instructions consulted. Symptoms may be managed as follows: 

• 

• 

Mild symptoms - complete paclitaxel infusion.  Supervise at bedside.  No treatment 
required.  Report as an AE. 

Moderate symptoms - stop paclitaxel infusion.  Give intravenous diphenhydramine 
25 to 50 mg and intravenous dexamethasone 10 mg.  Report as an AE.  Resume 
paclitaxel infusion after recovery of symptoms at a low rate, 20 ml/hour for 
15 minutes, then 40 ml/hour for 15 minutes, then, if there are no further symptoms, 
resume the paclitaxel infusion at full dose rate until it is complete.  If symptoms 
recur the patient should be permanently discontinued from paclitaxel / carboplatin 
doublet chemotherapy.

• 

Severe life-threatening symptoms - stop paclitaxel infusion.  Give intravenous 
diphenhydramine and dexamethasone as above.  Add epinephrine or broncho-
dilators if indicated.  The patient should be permanently discontinued from 
paclitaxel / carboplatin doublet chemotherapy. Report as a SAE. 

3.10.8  Hypersensitivity to carboplatin 
Local practice should be followed and local prescribing instructions consulted. 
Hypersensitivity to carboplatin, if mild, can be treated or prevented with intravenous steroids 
and antihistamine.  If the investigator feels this cannot be adequately controlled, carboplatin 
and paclitaxel should both be discontinued.  Report as an AE. 

3.10.9  Other toxicity 
For any unanticipated, clinically or potentially clinically significant drug-related CTCAE 
grade 3 or 4 toxicity not mentioned above, treatment with paclitaxel / carboplatin should be 
withheld until the patient recovers completely, or the toxicity reverts to CTC grade 1, up to a 
maximum of 14 days. Treatments should then be resumed at approximately 50% dose 
(permanent dose reduction).  For CTC grade 1 and 2 toxicities, no dose reduction should be 
made.  

Dose delays of >14 days from the planned date of administration will result in permanent 
discontinuation of study medication (Sections 3.1.1 and 3.3.5).

MEASUREMENTS OF STUDY VARIABLES AND 
DEFINITIONS OF OUTCOME VARIABLES 

Primary variable 

4.1 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomisation to the first 
documentation of objective disease progression (PD) or death from any cause.  Patients 
without a PFS event at the time of the primary analysis will be censored at the date of their 
last objective tumour assessment.  This includes patients lost to follow up or who have 
withdrawn consent.  The PFS for patients without post baseline tumour assessments will be 
censored at time zero days.  See Section 6 for the method of statistical analysis.

In addition, a physical examination (including height, weight, heart rate, temperature, blood 
pressure and respiratory system exam) will be performed. Only weight will be collected on the 
eCRF, to allow verification of creatinine clearance for exclusion criterion 11. 

Optional archival tumour samples will be collected for analysis as described in Appendix D. 

Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) measurements and variables 

4.3 
The methods for collecting Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) data are presented below. 

4.3.1 

Quality of Life (QoL)– Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Lung 
(FACT-L) 

4.3.1.1  Methods of assessment 
Data on QoL will be assessed using the FACT-L.  FACT-L has been validated with respect to 
its psychometric properties and sensitivity to clinical changes (Cella DF et al 1995, Cella DF 
et al 2002).  This questionnaire has been used in many clinical studies in patients with 
advanced lung cancer, including previous AstraZeneca studies, and is appropriate, valid, and 
sensitive to clinical changes in this study population. 

4.3.1.2  Administration of PRO questionnaires 
Each centre must allocate responsibility for the FACT-L questionnaires to a specific 
individual (eg, a Research Nurse). The AstraZeneca Clinical Team will provide training for 
relevant personnel in the administration of the questionnaires to help avoid the key problem of 
missing data. It is also important that the significance and relevance of the data are explained 
carefully to participating patients so that they are motivated to comply with data collection 
(Fallowfield LJ et al 1987). 

The date of completion of each FACT-L questionnaire should be noted on the pCRF. 

The instructions for completion of the FACT-L are: 

56(86) 

Revised Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839)

Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
• 

It should be completed in private by the patient in their own time 

• 

• 

• 

• 

It must be completed by the patient before any investigations or discussions about 
their disease with the study centre staff 

The patient should not receive help from relatives, friends or study centre staff to 
answer the questionnaire. However if the patient is unable to complete the 
questionnaire themselves (eg is blind, illiterate or too frail) the questions may be 
read out and the responses completed by the site staff. The site staff must not try to 
influence the answers given.  

Patient can only choose one answer to each question 

Immediately following completion of FACT-L questionnaire, the Research Nurse or 
appointed individual must review the FACT-L questionnaire for completeness.  If 
items are missed, the form must be returned to the patient immediately for 
completion. 

QoL and symptom data will only be collected in those markets where a validated translation 
of the FACT-L is available. 

4.3.1.3  Derivation or calculation of variable 
The following subscale scores will be derived from the FACT-L questionnaire:  

• 

• 

• 

• 

The physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), social/family well-
being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), and Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS) 
domain scores from the FACT-L questionnaire 

Trial Outcome Index (TOI) which is the sum of the PWB, FWB, and LCS domain 
scores 

The 7-Item LCS total score 

The overall score for the questionnaire (FACT-L) which is the sum of the PWB, 
FWB, SWB, EWB, and LCS domain scores. 

If < 50% of the subscale items are missing, the subscale score will be divided by the number 
of non-missing items and multiplied by the total number of items by the subscale.  If 50% or 
more of the data items are missing, that subscale will be treated as missing.  The reason for 
any missing data will be identified.  If data is missing at random, the above techniques will be 
used.  If there is evidence that the missing data is systematic, missing values will be handled 
to ensure that any possible bias is minimized.

4.6.3.1  Methods of assessment 
The RECIST criteria will be used to assess objective tumour response.  Details of target and 
non-target lesions will be collected on the appropriate eCRF pages and used to calculate 
tumour response.  Post-baseline tumour evaluations should use the same modality (CT scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) as used at baseline and should preferably be undertaken 
at the same institution (see Appendix C).  

A retrospective independent review of scans used in the assessment of tumours by RECIST 
criteria may be conducted. Tumour assessment scans, including unscheduled visit images (CT, 
MRI, plain x-ray), may be collected and a Contract Research Organisation (CRO) appointed 
to perform central review. The central review may be used in supplementary analyses for 
RECIST based study endpoints.

The objective tumour response rate will be calculated as the percentage of evaluable patients 
with CR or PR (as defined in Appendix C).  

Safety measurements and variables 

4.7 
The methods for collecting safety data are described below.  

Adverse events 

4.7.1 
4.7.1.1  Definitions 
The definitions of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and other significant 
adverse events (OAEs) are given below.  It is of the utmost importance that all staff involved 
in the study are familiar with the content of this section.  The principal investigator is 
responsible for ensuring this. 

Adverse event 
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration 
of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 

Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be reported as an 
AE.  Signs and symptoms clearly associated with the disease under study should not be 
reported as AEs unless they are newly emergent (ie, not previously observed in the patient) 
judged by the Investigator to be unusually severe or accelerated, or if the investigator 
considers deterioration of disease related signs  and symptoms to be caused directly by the

Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
drug.  If there is any uncertainty about an AE being solely due to the disease under study it 
should be reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate. 

Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, 
washout, follow-up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

results in death 

is immediately life-threatening 

requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation 

results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 

is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 

is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 

The causality of SAEs (ie, their relationship to study treatment) will be assessed by the 
investigator(s), who in completing the relevant case report form must answer “yes” or “no” to 
the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by any of the following – study medication – other medication?”  For further 
guidance on the definition of a SAE and a guide to the interpretation of the causality question, 
see Appendix B to the Clinical Study Protocol. 

Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be reported as 
an SAE. 

Signs and symptoms clearly associated with the disease under study should not be reported as 
AEs unless they are newly emergent (ie not previously observed in the patient) judged by the 
Investigator to be unusually severe or accelerated, or if the investigator considers deterioration 
of disease related signs & symptoms to be caused directly by the drug.  If there is any 
uncertainty about an AE being solely due to the disease under study it should be reported as an 
AE or SAE as appropriate. 

Note that SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure should also be reported. For 
such events the causal relationship is implied as "yes". 

Other Significant Adverse Events (OAE) 
OAEs will be identified by the Clinical Study Team Physician during the evaluation of safety 
data for the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  Significant adverse events of particular clinical 
importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to discontinuation of the patient from

study treatment, will be classified as OAEs.  Examples of these are marked haematological 
and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain events that lead to intervention (other than 
those already classified as serious), dose reduction or significant additional treatment.  For 
each OAE, a narrative may be written and included in the CSR. 

4.7.1.2  Recording of adverse events 
(i) 

Method for detecting AE/SAE  

At each visit the method of detecting AEs and SAEs in this study will be by the following:  

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(ii) 

Information volunteered by the patient, or carer,  

Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient at every visit such as 
the following: How are you feeling? Have you had any (other) medical problems 
since your last visit 

Observation by the investigational team, other care providers or relatives. 

Time period for collection of AE/SAEs  

Non-serious AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time consent is given, throughout the 
first line treatment period and up to and including the 28 day follow-up period.  Following the 
primary analysis data cut off SAEs should continue to be reported, however no new non-
serious AEs should be collected.  For patients in arm A receiving second line carboplatin/ 
paclitaxel provided by the sponsor, SAEs only will be collected during the second line 
carboplatin / paclitaxel treatment period, up to and including the 28 day follow-up period.  

(iii) 

Collection of AE data 

All AEs will be recorded on the eCRFs provided.  A description of the event, including its 
date of onset and resolution, whether it constitutes a SAE or not, any action taken (eg, changes 
to study treatment, other treatment given, and follow-up tests), and outcome should be 
provided along with the investigator’s assessment of causality (the relationship to the study 
treatment[s]).  AEs will also be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Toxicity Criteria, Version 3.0 and changes tracked on the relevant eCRF. 

(iv) 

Causality 

For an AE to be a suspected drug-related event, there should be at least a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship between the study medicinal product and the AE (see 
Appendix B for guidelines on interpretation of causality and bullet points below). 

• 

• 

Time course – temporal relationship to receiving drug 

Consistency with known drug profile

Drug Substance Gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839)   
Study Code D791AC00007  
Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
• 

Dechallenge experience – AE resolves after stopping drug 

• 

• 

• 

No alternative cause – AE cannot be explained by aetiology, underlying disease, 
etc. 

Rechallenge experience – AE reoccurs when drug reintroduced 

Laboratory tests 

(v) 

Disease progression 

Any events that are unequivocally due to progression of disease must not be reported as an 
AE. 

(vi) 

Lack of efficacy 

When there is deterioration in the condition for which the study treatment is being used (ie, 
NSCLC) there may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such 
cases, unless AstraZeneca or the reporting physician considers that the study treatment 
contributed to the deterioration, or local regulations state to the contrary, the deterioration 
should be considered to be a lack of efficacy and not an AE. 

(vii) 

Deaths 

All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol defined follow-up period after 
the administration of the last dose of study treatment, must be reported as follows: 

Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported to the study monitor at the 
next monitoring visit and should be documented in the eCRF but should not be reported as a 
SAE.   

Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of disease under study, the AE 
causing the death must be reported to the study monitor as a SAE within 24 hours.  The report 
should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of disease, if 
appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death.  

Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.  A post mortem maybe 
helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy of the post-mortem 
results should be forwarded to AstraZeneca, Patient Safety within the usual timeframes. 

(viii) 

New Cancers 

The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet at 
least one of the serious criteria.  New cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the 
administration of the study treatment and have been identified after the inclusion of the patient 
into this study.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  Symptoms of new 

64(86) 

Revised Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839)   
Study Code D791AC00007  
Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
metastases or the new metastases themself should not be reported as an AE/SAE as they are 
considered to be disease progression. 

(ix) 

Abnormal laboratory findings/vital signs 

The reporting of laboratory findings/vital sign abnormalities as both laboratory findings/vital 
signs and AEs should be avoided.  They should not be reported as an AE unless : any criterion 
for a SAE is fulfilled, the laboratory finding/vital sign abnormalities causes the patient to 
discontinue from the study, or the investigator insists the abnormality should be reported as an 
AE.  If an abnormal laboratory finding/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign/symptom should be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory 
finding/vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the 
relevant eCRF. 

(x) 

Follow up of AEs/SAEs 

After the initial AE/SAE report the investigator is required to follow up proactively each 
patient and provide further information to AstraZeneca on the patient’s condition.  During the 
study all AE/SAEs should be followed up to resolution unless the event is considered by the 
investigator to be unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease, or the patient is 
lost to follow up. 

(xi) 

Handling unresolved AE/SAEs at completion/discontinuation 

All ongoing AEs and SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless, in the investigator’s 
opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease. 

AstraZeneca reserves the right to ask for further information on any AE that may be 
considered of interest. 

(xii) 

Overdose 

Should an overdose (accidental or deliberate) occur, it must be reported in accordance with the 
procedures described in Section 9.3 regardless of whether the overdose was associated with 
any symptom or not.  All symptoms associated with the overdose should be reported as AEs. 

(xiii) 

Pregnancy 

Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported in accordance with the procedures described in 
Section 9.4.  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an 
investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive 
medication.

Date 29 January 2010 
4.7.1.3  Reporting of serious adverse events 
Investigators and other site personnel must inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives of 
any SAE that occurs in the course of the study within 1 day (ie, immediately but no later than 
the end of the next business day) of when he or she becomes aware of it. 

SAE information will be entered and submitted into the Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) 
system on the relevant eCRF modules.  An automated email alert will be sent to the 
designated AstraZeneca representative who will work with the investigator to ensure that all 
the necessary information is available in the system within the required time frames, but 
taking advantage of the time allocated in those timelines.  The AstraZeneca representative will 
notify the appropriate AstraZeneca Patient Safety department through the WBDC system via 
email that a completed electronic SAE module and relevant information from other 
appropriate eCRF modules is available in the WBDC system.  If the system is unavailable, the 
investigator should fax a paper back-up SAE report to the AstraZeneca representative 
immediately, recognising that the same reporting time frames still apply.  The investigator is 
responsible for completing the eCRF as soon as the system becomes available again.   

Follow-up information on SAEs must also be reported by the investigator within the same 
time frames. If follow-up indicates a change in the SAE from serious to fatal or life-
threatening, this information needs to be available in the WBDC system within 1 calendar 
day. 

If a non-serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow-up information must also 
be provided to AstraZeneca within 1 day. 

The AstraZeneca representative will work with the investigator to compile all the necessary 
information and ensure that the appropriate AstraZeneca Patient Safety Department receives a 
report by day 1 for all fatal and life-threatening cases and by day 5 for all other SAEs. 

All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the study drugs or 
to the study procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.  The investigator is 
responsible for informing the Ethics Committee and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE 
as per local requirements

4.7.4.1  Methods of assessment 
Full physical examinations will be performed and will include WHO performance status, 
height, weight, heart rate, temperature, blood pressure and respiratory system exam.  Only 
WHO performance status and weight will be recorded in the eCRF. 

Performance status will be scored as follows: 

0 =  Fully active, able to carry out all usual activities without restrictions and without 

                   the aid of analgesia 

1 = Restricted in strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out light work or 

                  pursue a sedentary occupation.  This group also contains patients who are fully 
                  active, as in grade 0, but only with the aid of analgesics 

2 = Ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to work.  Up and about more 

                   than 50% of waking hours 

3 = Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of 

                  waking hours 

4 = Completely disabled, unable to carry out any self-care and confined totally to bed 

                  or chair. 

4.7.4.2  Derivation or calculation of outcome variables 
Any new medical condition reported during the study will be recorded as an AE.  Only those 
findings that are in addition to the condition being treated will be recorded as AEs, see 
Section 4.7.1.2 for recording of AEs.  Conditions that are considered by the investigator to be 
unequivocally due to disease progression will not be recorded as AEs.

DATA MANAGEMENT 

Data will be entered in the WBDC system at the study site.  Trained study personnel will be 
responsible for entering data on the observations, tests and assessments specified in the 
protocol into the WBDC system and according to the eCRF Instructions.  The eCRF 
Instructions will also provide the study site with data entry instructions.   

Data entered in the WBDC system will be immediately saved to a central database and 
changes tracked to provide an audit trail.  When data have been entered reviewed, edited and 
Source Data Verification (SDV) performed the principal investigator will be notified to sign 
the eCRF electronically as per the agreed project process and data will be locked to prevent 
further editing.  A copy of the eCRF will be archived at the study site.  

FACT-L questionnaires will be collected on paper forms which will be collected by the site 
monitor. AstraZeneca personnel will enter FACT-L data onto the clinical database.

Statistical analysis will take place in two stages.  The primary analysis will take place after 
944 progression events have occurred and will include all primary and secondary outcome 
variable data available at the time of data cut-off, apart from overall survival.  Patients will 
then continue to be followed up for overall survival and a second analysis will take place after 
944 deaths have occurred.  This will include the overall survival outcome variable only. 

In addition, one interim analysis is planned.  See Section 6.6 for details.

All populations will be analysed by randomised treatment except for the EFS population, 
which will be analysed by treatment received. 

Method of statistical analysis 
Primary outcome variable – progression free survival 

6.4 
6.4.1 
The analysis population for progression free survival (PFS) will be the ITT population. 

The primary statistical analysis will compare the PFS between first line gefitinib and first line 
carboplatin/paclitaxel using a proportional hazards model adjusted for performance status (0-1 
vs 2), smoking history (never vs light ex-smoker), and gender.  The hazard ratio (gefitinib: 
carboplatin/paclitaxel) will be estimated together with its 95% confidence interval and p-
value.  The null hypothesis of survival inferiority will be rejected and non-inferiority will be 
concluded if the upper 95% confidence limit lies below 1.2. 

If the null hypothesis of progression-free survival inferiority is rejected and if the upper 95% 
confidence limit for the hazard ratio lies below 1.0 then superior PFS for gefitinib will be 
declared (closed test procedure per Morikawa T et al 1995). 

Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals will also be presented for each strata of the 
adjustment factors used in the model. 

PFS will also be displayed graphically using Kaplan-Meier plots (Kaplan EL et al 1958).  
Median PFS will be summarised for each arm. 

A subgroup analysis will be performed in the group of FISH positive patients.  This will be 
done using the same methodology as the overall analysis, but using 99% confidence intervals 
to reflect the need for a subgroup to show a greater treatment effect in order to be persuasive 
as a standalone result. 

Secondary outcome variables 

6.4.2 
6.4.2.1  Overall survival  
The analysis population for overall survival (OS) will be the ITT population. 

OS on gefitinib followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel (Arm A) compared to 
carboplatin/paclitaxel (Arm B) will be analysed using the same methods as for PFS 
(Section 6.4.1).  The confidence interval for the hazard ratio will be examined to determine 
what survival differences can and cannot be ruled out.   

Additionally, 1-year survival rates will be presented for each arm. 

6.4.2.2  Objective tumour response 
The analysis population for objective tumour response rate will be the EFR population.

Date 29 January 2010 
Objective tumour response rates will be compared between gefitinib and carboplatin/ 
paclitaxel using a logistic regression model adjusted for performance status (0-1 vs 2), 
smoking history (never vs light ex-smoker), and gender.  The odds ratio will be estimated 
together with its 95% confidence interval and p-value.   

The objective tumour response rate will be estimated for each arm. Duration of response will 
also be summarised in the EFR population.   

Investigator assessment of best overall response to second line treatment will be summarised. 

Safety 

6.4.2.3 
The analysis population for safety data will be the EFS population. 

Safety profiles will be assessed in terms of AEs and laboratory data/vital signs that will be 
collected for all patients.  Appropriate summaries of AEs and laboratory data/vital signs will 
be produced and compared across first line treatments. 

Incidence and reasons for study drug dose modifications (interruptions or reductions) and 
withdrawals will be summarised by first line treatment. 

A formal statistical comparison of first line treatments will be performed for specific safety 
events as follows: 

Events possibly associated with carboplatin/paclitaxel: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

CTCAE grade 3, 4 or 5 neutropenia [neutrophils <1x109/L] 

CTCAE grade 3, 4 or 5 thrombocytopenia [platelets <50x109/L] 

CTCAE grade 3, 4 or 5 leukopenia [white blood cells <2x109/L] 

CTCAE grade 3, 4 or 5 anaemia [haemoglobin <8.0 g/dL] 

Neurotoxicity (specific adverse event terms will be defined before database lock) 

Events possibly associated with gefitinib: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Rash (specific adverse event terms will be defined before database lock) 

Diarrhoea (specific adverse event terms will be defined before database lock) 

Nausea (specific adverse event terms will be defined before database lock)

Adjusted p-values will be calculated. 

6.4.2.4  Quality of Life 
The analysis population for QoL data will be the EFQ population. 

QoL will be compared between first line gefitinib and first line carboplatin/paclitaxel using 
the mean on-treatment total FACT-L change from baseline score.  The difference between 
treatment arms and 95% confidence interval will be derived from an ANCOVA model 
allowing for the effects of treatment group, baseline score, performance status (0-1 vs 2), 
smoking history (never vs light ex-smoker), and gender. 

To examine the effect of differential treatment withdrawal times, an additional supportive 
analysis will also be performed, where only data from Visits 2 to 14 are used (the time when 
both randomised arms are scheduled to be on first line treatment) and scores after a patient has 
withdrawn from first line treatment are set to the worst case scenario. 

QoL improvement rates (as defined in Section 4.3.2), time to improvement, duration of 
improvement and time to worsening will be summarised by treatment arm. 

TOI score and improvement rates will be summarised descriptively by treatment arm. 

Symptom improvement 

6.4.2.5 
The analysis population for symptom data will be the EFQ population. 

The LCS score will be analysed in the same way as the FACT-L total score, as described in 
Section 6.4.2.4. 

Symptom improvement rates (as described in Section 4.3.4) will be summarised by treatment 
arm in symptomatic patients only. 

Exploratory outcome variables 

6.4.3 
6.4.3.1  Health care resource use 
Health care resource use, such as inpatient hospital stays, outpatient visits, emergency room 
visits and major medical procedures will be summarised in the EFS population using 
appropriate summary statistics.

median PFS on gefitinib was 7.6 months.  Kasahara K et al 2005 showed that in a study of 
unselected first line patients the median PFS on gefitinib was 3.3 months.  Therefore in this 
selected population we may expect to see a median PFS of around 6 months.  

A non-inferiority design has been chosen because it is of interest to show gefitinib is at least 
as effective as chemotherapy given the side effect profile of gefitinib is modest and non-life 
threatening in comparison with the severe burden of toxicity associated with standard 
chemotherapy.  The non-inferiority limit chosen for PFS is a hazard ratio of 1.2, which 
translates to up to 1 month shortfall on gefitinib if the PFS on carboplatin/paclitaxel is 
6 months.  This was felt to be the maximum shortfall that would be acceptable taking into 
account the potential advantages of a generally well tolerated oral agent compared to standard 
intravenous chemotherapy.  For overall survival, given the relatively short life expectancy of 
this population of patients, a shortfall greater than 7 weeks was felt to be clinically significant 
given that chemotherapy is offered despite only relatively modest improvements in overall 
survival compared to BSC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group 1995). 

A total of 944 progression events will be needed in order to rule out a hazard ratio 
(gefitinib:carboplatin/paclitaxel) of 1.2,  i.e. that median PFS on gefitinib is no more than 1 
month less than the 6 months expected with carboplatin/paclitaxel.  Using this number of 
events would give an 80% chance [power] of concluding non-inferiority (if gefitinib was truly 
non-inferior) with a 5% 2-sided chance [significance level] of concluding non-inferiority in 
error. 

Recruitment is expected to be non-linear, with half of the planned patients entered after 
approximately two thirds of the recruitment period.  If the study has a recruitment period of 20 
months and 1212 patients were randomised (606 per treatment arm) then a follow-up period of 
6 months should be sufficient to see 944 progression events. 

All patients will also be followed up for overall survival until 944 deaths occur (an expected 
12 months of additional follow-up on top of the 6 months for PFS, assuming 12 month median 
overall survival [Kubota K et al 2004showed that the median survival in first line patients 
treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel was 12.3 months]).  These data will be analysed to examine 
what survival differences can and cannot be ruled out.  If gefitinib followed by 
carboplatin/paclitaxel (Arm A) and carboplatin/paclitaxel (Arm B) are equal in terms of 
overall survival (observed hazard ratio=1), then with 944 events the upper 95% confidence 
limit for the hazard ratio will be 1.14, i.e. an excess hazard of 14% on gefitinib Arm A could 
be ruled out.  If the median overall survival on carboplatin/paclitaxel is 12 months, then this 
means that a survival shortfall of 1.44 months on gefitinib Arm A could be ruled out.  

Analyses of the subset of patients recruited in Japan and the subset of patients recruited in 
mainland China are planned to satisfy potential regulatory requests.  It is recognised that, due 
to small numbers, these will have insufficient power to test for non-inferiority in terms of a 
20% shortfall if there is truly no difference in PFS between the two first line treatments

(hazard ratio=1).  For a subset of 200, the observed hazard ratio would need to be <0.876 (i.e. 
median PFS 6.85 months on gefitinib vs 6 months on carboplatin/pcalitaxel) for non-
inferiority to be concluded, and <0.73 (i.e. median PFS 8.2 months on gefitinib vs 6 months 
on carboplatin/paclitaxel) for superiority to be concluded.   

Interim analysis 

6.6 
One interim analysis is planned.  The purpose of this analysis is to detect inferiority of first 
line gefitinib compared to first line carboplatin/paclitaxel in terms of PFS.  The analysis will 
be performed by an independent statistician with no involvement in the study. 

The timing of the planned analysis will be event driven.  A cut-off date will be set to coincide 
with when it is estimated that 150 subjects will have experienced a progression event.  PFS 
and safety data from all patients randomised at the time of the cut-off will be collected. 

PFS will be analysed as per the final analysis.  Consideration will be given to stop the study 
early if PFS for gefitinib is inferior to carboplatin/paclitaxel at a 2-sided 10% significance 
level, i.e. the lower 90% confidence limit for the hazard ratio is >1.0 (equivalent to the point 
estimate for the hazard ratio being >1.3).  With this rule, the chance of stopping the study in 
error if there is truly no difference between gefitinib and carboplatin/paclitaxel is 5%, and the 
overall power is only modestly reduced from 80% to 77%. 

Assuming non-linear accrual, the required 150 progression events are expected to occur 
approximately 11 months into recruitment, when about 35% of subjects will be entered. 

This analysis will have 80% power when the true hazard ratio is 1.5, corresponding to a 
median PFS of 4 months on gefitinib versus 6 months on carboplatin/paclitaxel. 

There will be no adjustment of significance level for the final analysis as there will be no 
opportunity at the interim to accept non-inferiority for PFS. 

Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  

6.7 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), which is comprised of a panel of 
experts and opinion leaders who will be independent of AstraZeneca will meet to review the 
interim efficacy analysis.  The IDMC will make recommendations to the study Steering 
Committee as appropriate to stop the study early or continue. 

The interim analysis will be conducted by an independent external statistician who will 
communicate the results directly to the IDMC.  AstraZeneca, the Steering Committee and 
study investigators will not have access to or detailed knowledge of the interim analysis 
results beyond the recommendation to stop or continue the study. If the study is stopped, then 
the data will be made available to AstraZeneca. 

The IDMC may also request additional data updates during the course of the study.

achieve the study objectives. 

7. 

STUDY MANAGEMENT 

Monitoring 

7.1 
Before first patient into the study, a representative of AstraZeneca will visit the investigational 
study site to: 

• 

• 

determine the adequacy of the facilities 

discuss with the investigator(s) (and other personnel involved with the study) their 
responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of 
AstraZeneca or its representatives.  This will be documented in a Clinical Study 
Agreement between AstraZeneca and the investigator 

During the study, a monitor from AstraZeneca or company representing AstraZeneca will 
have regular contacts with the study site, including visits to: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

provide information and support to the investigator(s) 

confirm that facilities remain acceptable 

confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed 

perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the 
patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to 
the study).  This will require direct access to all original records for each patient 
(eg, clinic charts). 

The monitor or another AstraZeneca representative will be available between visits if the 
investigator(s) or other staff at the centre need information and advice. 

Audits and inspections 

7.2 
Authorised representatives of AstraZeneca, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) or an Institutional Review Board (IRB) may visit the centre to perform 

77(86) 

Revised Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839)   
Study Code D791AC00007  
Edition Number 3 
Date 29 January 2010 
audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of an AstraZeneca audit 
or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analysed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.  The investigator should contact AstraZeneca immediately if 
contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection at his or her centre. 

Training of staff 

7.3 
The principal investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study 
(medical, nursing and other staff).  He or she will ensure that appropriate training relevant to 
the study is given to all of these staff, and that any new information of relevance to the 
performance of this study is forwarded to the staff involved. 

Before the first patient is entered into the study, the investigational staff will be trained to use 
the WBDC system by AstraZeneca personnel or delegates. 

Changes to the protocol 

7.4 
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the Co-ordinating 
Investigators and AstraZeneca. 

If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended, the amendment or a new version of the 
study protocol (Amended Protocol) must be notified to or approved by each IRB or IEC, and 
if applicable, also the local regulatory authority, before implementation.  Local requirements 
must be followed. 

If a protocol amendment requires a change to a particular centre’s Informed Consent Form, 
then AstraZeneca and the centre’s IRB or IEC must be notified.  Approval of the revised 
Informed Consent Form by AstraZeneca and by the IRB or IEC is required before the revised 
form is used.   

AstraZeneca will distribute amendments and new versions of the protocol to each principal 
investigator(s), who in turn is responsible for the distribution of these documents to his or her 
IRB or IEC, and to the staff at his or her centre.  The distribution of these documents to the 
regulatory authority will be handled according to local practice. 

Study agreements 

7.5 
The principal investigator at each centre must comply with all the terms, conditions, and 
obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement for this study.  In the event of any inconsistency 
between this Clinical Study Protocol and the Clinical Study Agreement, the Clinical Study 
Protocol shall prevail.

• 

signed Clinical Study Protocol and other agreements between AstraZeneca and the 
Principal Investigator/Study Site. 

approval of the study by the IRB/IEC 

approval of the study, if applicable, by the regulatory authority.   

The end of study is defined as the time at which, following the survival analysis, the results 
are known by the investigators. After this point the study will be closed and patients will no 
longer be exposed to study related activities. 

The study may be stopped early on recommendation of the IDMC following the planned 
interim analysis (see Sections 6.6 and 6.7). 

8. 

ETHICS 

Ethics review 

8.1 
The final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Forms, must be 
approved or given a favourable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC as appropriate.  The 
investigator must submit written approval to AstraZeneca before he or she can enrol any 
patient into the study.   

The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to 
the protocol in accordance with local requirements.  In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve 
all advertising used to recruit patients for the study.  The protocol must be re-approved by the 
IRB or IEC annually, as local regulations require.  

Ethical conduct of the study 

8.2 
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, applicable 
regulatory requirements and the AstraZeneca policy on Bioethics.  

Informed consent 

8.3 
The principal investigator(s) at each centre will ensure that the patient is given full and 
adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of 
the study.  Patients must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any 
time.  The patient should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to 
consider the information provided.

Procedures in case of medical emergency 

9.2 
The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are 
available to handle medical emergencies during the study.  A medical emergency usually 
constitutes an SAE and should be reported as such, see Section 4.7.1.1. 
9.3 
Overdose is defined as a dose administration to a patient in excess of that specified in the 
protocol or IB.   

Procedures in case of overdose 

(a)   Gefitinib 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Use of gefitinib in doses greater than 1000 mg daily should only be recorded in the 
eCRF as an AE of "overdose" if there are associated clinical symptoms or signs 

An overdose with associated SAEs should be recorded as the SAE 
diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE forms in the eCRF 

An overdose with associated non-serious AEs should be recorded as the AE 
diagnose/symptoms on the relevant AE forms in the eCRF.  In addition, the 
overdose should be reported on the separate AstraZeneca “Clinical Study Overdose 
Report Form” 

An overdose without associated symptoms should not be recorded as an AE in the 
eCRF.  The overdose should be reported on the separate AZ “Clinical Study 
Overdose Report Form.” 

(b)   Carboplatin and Paclitaxel  

Use of carboplatin / paclitaxel in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol should only 
be recorded in the eCRF as an AE of "overdose" if there are associated clinical symptoms or 
signs. 

Approved product labelling should be consulted for information regarding overdose for 
carboplatin / paclitaxel.

Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicion that the 
investigational product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a 
contraceptive medication.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed 
up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from this study.  

All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages 
should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications 
should not be handled as AEs.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to AstraZeneca 
on the pregnancy outcomes report form. 

Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an adverse event.  However, the 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented.  The outcomes of any 
conception occurring from the date of the first dose, up to and including the last menstrual 
cycle in which the female may have been exposed to gefitinib, must be followed up and 
documented. 

All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to AstraZeneca on the pregnancy outcomes 
report form.  The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriages, elective termination, 
normal birth, or congenital abnormality/birth defects) must be followed up and documented 
(on the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form) even if the patient was discontinued from the study.
