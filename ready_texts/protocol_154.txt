A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study 
to Evaluate AMG 162 in the Treatment of Bone Loss in 
Subjects Undergoing Androgen-Deprivation Therapy for 
Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer 
Phase 3  
Treatment of bone loss in patients undergoing androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) for non-metastatic prostate 
cancer (PC). 
The primary objective is to determine the treatment 
effect of AMG 162 compared with placebo on lumbar 
spine bone mineral density (BMD) at month 24 in men 
with non-metastatic PC undergoing ADT.  
Secondary objectives are as follows: 

(cid:120)  To determine the treatment effect of AMG 162 

compared with placebo on the following: 

o  Percent change of femoral neck BMD,  

and total hip BMD from baseline to 
month 24 

o  Percent change of lumbar spine BMD, 
femoral neck BMD and total hip BMD 
from baseline to month 36  

o  Subject incidence of any fracture and 
subject incidence of new vertebral 
fracture over the 36-month evaluation 
period  

o  Time to first clinical fracture over the 

36-month evaluation period  

o  Subject incidence of any fracture over the 

24-month evaluation period 

(cid:120)  To assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of 

AMG 162 in this population Safety will be 
followed for up to 2 years after the end of the 
36-month treatment phase (as described in 
Section 7.18). 

International, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study in patients with non-metastatic 
prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT).  Approximately 1226 patients will be 
randomly assigned to receive placebo or AMG 162 in a 
1:1 allocation ratio.  The randomization schedule will be 
stratified based on age group ((cid:31) 70, (cid:116) 70 years of age), 
and duration of ADT with GnRH agonist, or orchiectomy 
at the time of study entry ((cid:100) 6 months vs. > 6 months).

All subjects will receive daily supplemental calcium and 
vitamin D, and will participate in the study for 36 months.
All subjects who were randomized to the original 
36-month study who received at least one dose of 
investigational product and who completed the 36-month 
treatment phase will be asked to participate in the safety 
follow up phase.  Safety data including clinical fracture 
information will be collected by clinic visit or telephone 
contact approximately every 6 months for up to 2 years 
after the 36-month treatment period. 
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will 
monitor subject safety on an ongoing basis. 
The primary endpoint is the percentage change from 
baseline in lumbar spine BMD to month 24. 

Secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 

(cid:120)  Percent change of femoral neck BMD, and total 

hip BMD from baseline to month 24 

(cid:120)  Percent change of lumbar spine BMD, femoral 
neck BMD and total hip BMD from baseline to 
month 36  

(cid:120)  Subject incidence of any fracture and subject 
incidence of new vertebral fracture over the 
36-month evaluation period  

(cid:120)  Time to first clinical fracture over the 36-month 

evaluation period  

(cid:120)  Subject incidence of any fracture during the 

24-month evaluation period 

Safety endpoints including the following:  

1.  Adverse event incidence by system, organ, class, 

and preferred term 

2.  Laboratory values (including changes in 

chemistry, hematology, and immunological 
laboratory parameters) 

3.  Changes in vital signs, height and weight at each 

visit 

4.  Subject incidence of anti-AMG 162 antibodies 
5.  AMG 162 serum levels at day 1, and at months 1, 

3, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30 and 36 (PK)

randomized.  Subjects will return at months 1, 3, 6, 12, 
15, 18, 24, 30 and 36 for study related procedures and 
evaluations.  Safety data including clinical fracture 
information will be collected by clinic visit or telephone 
contact approximately every 6 months for up to 2 years 
after the 36-month treatment period. 
Baseline related assessments and study related 
procedures and evaluations will include a physical 
examination, obtaining radiographs, bone densitometry, 
bone scan, collection of baseline/concomitant 
medications, assessment of adverse events and clinical 
fractures, investigational product administration, 
administration of Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) 
questionnaire, collection of blood samples for chemistry, 
hematology, PSA, testosterone, AMG 162 antibody, 
AMG 162 serum levels, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, bone 
markers, and biomarker. 

Statistical Considerations  This study is designed to evaluate the benefit of  

AMG 162 relative to placebo (calcium and vitamin D 
alone) to increase BMD during the 24-month treatment 
period and to reduce the subject incidence of fracture in 
the study population. 

The final analysis will be conducted at the significance 
level of 0.05 after all subjects are given opportunity to 
complete the 36-month evaluation.   

The primary and secondary null hypotheses will be 
tested using the hierarchical analysis strategy and the 
Hochberg procedure to control the overall significance 
level of 0.05. 
The  analysis  of  the  percent  change  from  baseline  in 
lumbar spine BMD will employ an ANCOVA model that
includes  treatment  (AMG  162  or  placebo),  stratification 
factors,  baseline  BMD  value,  machine  type  (Lunar  or 
Hologic),  and  interaction  between  baseline  BMD  and 
machine type as covariates.  Missing BMD data will be 
imputed with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method.   
The null hypothesis of percent change in lumbar spine 
BMD will be tested via specifying a contrast in the 
estimate statement of the model.   

Subject incidence of new vertebral fracture will be 
compared between treatment groups using logistic 
regression model with the treatment group and 
stratification factors as covariates.

Analysis of any fracture will employ a logistic 
regression model with the treatment group and 
stratification factors as covariates if the absolute 
difference in the overall dropout rates between the 
treatment groups is < 3%.  Otherwise, analysis of 
any fracture will be based on the time to first any 
fracture using a Cox regression model with the 
treatment group as the independent variable and 
stratified by the randomization stratification factors. 

Time to first clinical fracture and time to first non-
vertebral fracture will be analyzed using a Cox 
regression model with treatment group as the 
independent variable and stratified by the randomization 
stratification factors.    

Safety will be characterized by evaluating incidence and 
severity of adverse events, and toxicity grade shift in lab 
values.  The number and percentage of patients who 
develop neutralizing anti-AMG 162 antibodies will be 
tabulated by study visit.

1.1 

OBJECTIVES   

Primary  

The primary objective is to determine the treatment effect of AMG 162 compared with 
placebo on lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at month 24 in men with 
non-metastatic PC undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 

1.2 

Secondary  

Secondary objectives are as follows: 

(cid:120)  To determine the treatment effect of AMG 162 compared with placebo on the 

following: 
-  Percent change of femoral neck BMD, and total hip BMD from baseline to 

month 24 

-  Percent change of lumbar spine BMD, femoral neck BMD and total hip 

BMD from baseline to month 36 

-  Subject incidence of any fracture and subject incidence of new vertebral 

fracture over the 36-month evaluation period  

-  Time to first clinical fracture over the 36-month evaluation period  

-  Subject incidence of any fracture over the 24-month evaluation period 

-  To assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of AMG 162 in this population.  

Safety will be followed for up to 2 years after the end of the 36-month 
treatment phase (as described in Section 7.18). 

1.3 

Exploratory  

The study will also explore the effect of AMG 162 on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA), 
overall survival, and patient reported outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

Disease  

PC is the most common malignancy in men, with an incidence rate of 220,900 cases per 
year and prevalence rate in excess of 2 million in the US alone (Jemal et al, 2003).  ADT 
with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is the mainstay of treatment for 
patients with metastatic disease.  The benefit of early initiation of ADT has been shown

in: (i) men with locally advanced, non-metastatic PC (MRC PC Working Party 
Investigators Group, 1997); (ii) men with locally advanced PC treated with radiation 
therapy (Bolla et al, 1997); and (iii) men with node-positive PC treated with radiation 
therapy and pelvic lymphadenectomy (Messing et al, 1999).  In addition, GnRH agonists 
are increasingly used when men experience a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) as 
the only evidence of disease recurrence after a local therapy.  

2.2 

AMG 162 Background  

AMG 162 is a fully human monoclonal antibody with high affinity (Kd 3 X 10-12 M) for 
Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-(cid:78)B Ligand (RANKL).  It blocks binding of RANKL to 
RANK and prevents terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts.  It also binds 
specifically to primate RANKL and does not bind to Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)(cid:68), 
TNF(cid:69), TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), or CD40L.   

RANKL is a critical factor in the terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts 
(Lacey et al, 1998; Yasuda et al, 1998; Burgess et al, 1999).  Genetic experiments 
demonstrated that mice with a disrupted RANKL gene have increased bone density and 
absence of osteoclasts (Kong et al, 1999).  Disorders of RANKL signaling have been 
implicated in many bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption, such as 
osteoporosis or bone destruction from skeletal metastases (Bucay et al, 1998;  
Kostenuik et al, 2001; Bekker et al, 2001).  Please refer to the Investigators Brochure for 
more information. 

2.2.1 

Preclinical Studies 

AMG 162 binds and neutralizes the activity of human and cynomolgus RANKL.  This 
neutralizing activity is shared by both native osteoprotegerin (OPG) and engineered 
forms of OPG, including human OPG-Fc.  Both AMG 162 and human OPG-Fc inhibit the 
hypercalcemic effect of soluble human RANKL in normal mice.  In healthy cynomolgus 
monkeys, AMG 162 produced an acute and profound reduction in bone resorption as 
assessed by levels of the surrogate marker serum N-telopeptide (N-Tx).  However, 
AMG 162 has no pharmacologic effects in mice or rats because it does not cross-react 
with rodent RANKL. 

Because of the lack of cross-reactivity of AMG 162 with rodent and murine RANKL, it 
has not been evaluated in the validated models of human disease.  However, the 
pharmacologic effects of RANKL antagonism in rodent disease models support the

potential usefulness of AMG 162 in human diseases.  In a model of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis, treatment of ovariectomized rats with an inhibitor of rat RANKL (OPG 
linked to polyethylene glycol) caused an increase in BMD. 

2.2.1.1 

Pharmacokinetic Studies  

The pharmacokinetics of AMG 162 was examined in rats and both pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics examined in cynomolgus monkeys.  The pharmacokinetic properties 
of AMG 162 appeared to be dramatically affected by cross-reactivity to RANKL.  In 
cynomolgus monkeys AMG 162 had a prolonged mean residence time (MRT), and low 
EC50 for NTx such that pharmacologically active serum concentrations were maintained 
for 35 days for a SC dose of 1 mg/kg.  Clearance was non-linear with dose, and volume 
of distribution was similar to plasma volume.  AMG 162 produced a rapid (within 4 hours) 
and profound (up to 72% inhibition from baseline) reduction in bone resorption that 
lasted up to 35 days following a single dose of 1 mg/kg, as assessed by levels of the 
sNTx.  Upon multiple dosing, anti-AMG 162 binding antibodies were detected in over 
50% of cynomolgus monkeys.  The incidence of anti-AMG 162 antibodies decreased as 
dose increased.  For long-term treatment in cynomolgus monkeys a dose of 50 mg/kg 
every month was shown to maintain pharmacologically effective serum levels in the 
majority of animals for up to 12 months.   

Additional information may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 

2.2.1.2 

Toxicology Studies  

Preclinical studies evaluating the safety of AMG 162 included tissue cross-reactivity, 
assessment of acute toxicity on the cardiovascular and respiratory system, and 
repeated-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  AMG 162 did not cross react 
with unexpected tissues in a standard panel of human tissues.  Immunoreactivity was 
observed in monkey and human lymph node, a tissue known to express high levels of 
RANKL (Lacey et al, 1998).  Hemodynamics, electrical activity of the heart 
(electrocardiograms), and respiratory rate were not affected by a 30 mg/kg single dose 
of AMG 162.  The initial repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that a 
dose of 10 mg/kg administered weekly for 4 weeks was well tolerated.  AMG 162 has 
been administered to monkeys monthly for 1 year at doses of 1, 10 and 50 mg/kg.  With 
the exception of the 2 unexpected deaths in the high dose male group, no definitive 
toxicologically significant effects were observed following 12 months of SC dosing.  The

2 unexpected deaths were not considered to be attributed to AMG 162 based on the 
difference in timing of the deaths, the non-specific nature of the lesions, and similarity to 
lesions observed in control animals.  Differences from control were noted for various 
clinical pathologies but were highly variable within treated and control groups and were 
not attributed to AMG 162 treatment.  Antibodies to AMG 162 were observed in animals 
at all doses.  Antibody positive animals had decreased drug levels and decreased effect 
on bone markers and BMD compared with antibody-negative animals.  The no-observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) following monthly SC treatment of AMG 162 for 12 months 
is considered to be 50 mg/kg.  This dose results in systemic exposure that is 50-fold 
greater compared to exposure from the current high dose in osteoporosis trials (210 mg 
6-monthly). 

Additional information may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 

2.2.2 

Safety Profile 

As of 24 March 2006, over 11,400 subjects have enrolled into clinical studies and have 
received at least 1 dose of investigational product (AMG 162, matching placebo, or 
active control).  Over 5,000 subjects have received AMG 162.  Single doses up to 
3 mg/kg SC or IV (weight-based) and 210 mg SC (fixed dose) have been studied.   

AMG 162 has been generally well tolerated in the clinical studies conducted to date.   

Adverse events that have been considered by an investigator to be related to AMG 162 
treatment have generally been diverse and mild to moderate in severity. 

Safety data available from five phase 1 studies that have been completed and a phase 2 
study that has completed 24-months of treatment in which data is available have 
demonstrated the tolerability of AMG 162.  The incidence of adverse events, including 
serious adverse events, was similar between subjects who received AMG 162 and those 
who received the active comparator or placebo treatment.  Evaluation of vital signs and 
ECGs indicated no notable changes in AMG 162-treated subjects compared with 
control-treated subjects.  No clinically significant trends indicative of an AMG 162 
treatment effect were noted in clinical laboratory measurements.  Expected changes in 
bone turnover markers and serum albumin-adjusted calcium associated with the 
pharmacologic action of AMG 162 were observed.  Transient hypocalcemia has been

observed in some subjects participating in clinical studies with AMG 162.  In most cases, 
the incidences of hypocalcaemia were not associated with any clinical symptoms.  

The detection of binding antibodies to AMG 162 in subjects has been uncommon.  
However when detected, these antibodies were of a transient nature and did not 
neutralize the biological activity of AMG 162 when tested in a bioassay.  No evidence of 
an effect on pharmacokinetics or bone turnover marker levels was observed in the 
subjects who developed binding antibodies. 

Interim results from a phase 2 study in postmenopausal women showed that the effect of 
AMG 162 on bone resorption appears to be fully reversible.  Discontinuing AMG 162 
may lead to reversal of the gains made in bone density.  To ensure these losses in bone 
density are not excessive, patients who discontinue AMG 162 should be followed 
carefully.  Alternative approaches to maintaining prior gains need to be discussed with 
the patient.  

Refer to the current investigator’s brochure for updated safety information. 

2.2.3 

Clinical Efficacy  

Based on data from study 20010124, a single SC or IV dose of AMG 162 was effective 
in reducing markers of bone turnover (eg, urine NTX/creatinine) in a dose-dependent 
manner.  The effect was observed as early as 12 hours following dosing.  The maximum 
mean decrease in urine NTX/creatinine was approximately 80% and the duration of 
effect was at least 6 months at higher doses (1 and 3 mg/kg AMG 162) in healthy 
postmenopausal women.   

Based on data from the Phase 2 study (20010223), the treatment effect of AMG 162 was 
evident as early as 1 month after dosing based on the lumbar spine and total hip BMD 
changes.  At the lumbar spine, a mean percent change from baseline of 1.0% was 
observed in the placebo group at 6 months compared with 3.8% to 6.0% in the AMG 162 
groups and 5.0% in the alendronate group.  A positive effect was observed at the 
femoral neck (0.5% in the placebo group, 1.9% to 3.2% in the AMG 162 groups, and 
2.3% in the alendronate group) and the total hip (0.2% in the placebo group at 6 months 
compared with 2.0% to 3.3% in the AMG 162 groups and 2.0% in the alendronate 
group).  No detrimental effect on BMD at a cortical bone site (distal 1/3 radius) was 
observed.

In subjects receiving AMG 162, a rapid and dose-dependent decrease was observed in 
the levels of the bone resorption markers, evident at day 4, the earliest post baseline 
time point.  The maximum mean decrease in serum CTX was 88% with AMG 162 
(compared with 70% with alendronate); the duration of the decrease reflected by these 
markers indicated a sustained effect for 6 months in the 100- and 210-mg AMG 162 
6-monthly dose groups.  The decrease was partially reversible in subjects in the 14- and 
60-mg 6-monthly groups, but the 60-mg dose was clearly more effective than the 
14-mg dose.  

The decrease in bone resorption markers occurred faster with AMG 162 than with 
alendronate, as indicated by a significantly greater reduction in serum CTX with all 
doses of AMG 162 at the day 4 through month 5 time points.  A delayed decrease 
(approximately 1 month) in the levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was 
observed with AMG 162 treatment, confirming that AMG 162 is primarily a bone 
antiresorptive agent and that bone resorption and bone formation remain coupled with 
AMG 162 treatment. 

2.3 

Rationale  

ADT with GnRH agonists decrease serum concentrations of testosterone by >90% and 
estrogen by ~75% (Stoch et al, 2001; Smith et al, 2001).  Because gonadal steroids are 
essential in maintaining skeletal integrity in men, ADT has detrimental effects on the 
musculoskeletal system.  The reported rates of BMD loss vary by types of ADT and 
study population, but range approximately from 3% to 5% per year  
(Ross and Small, 2002).  Similarly, retrospective studies of men treated with GnRH 
agonists have observed fracture rates of 5% to 30%, but the study findings were limited 
by small sample size, different length of follow-up, and patient survey bias  
(Townsend et al, 1997; Modi et al, 2001; Oefelein et al, 2001).  A recent Medicare 
database analysis from a 5% national random sample of Medicare beneficiaries reported 
the cumulative proportion of subjects developing bone complications shown in Table 1, 
consistent with a high incidence of osteoporosis and fracture (Krupski et al,  
4th Int Conf on Cancer Induced Bone Disease, 2003).  Another population-based study 
of men who underwent bilateral orchiectomy reported that approximately 40% to 50% of 
fractures in this population are “spontaneous” or “incidental” vertebral fractures  
(Melton et al, 2003).  There are no guidelines on how to manage detrimental skeletal

More recently, data from a large (more than 50,000 subjects) linked database of the 
US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
program and Medicare, were reported showing that men with prostate cancer 
undergoing androgen deprivation therapy are at significant risk of developing fractures in 
the spine and nonvertebral locations including the hip, pelvis, extremities, skull and ribs 
(Shahinian et al, 2005).  The proportions of patients with fractures at each of these 
locations were significantly higher (up to 2-fold) in patients undergoing androgen 
deprivation therapy as compared to age-matched controls.  Importantly, a total of 19.4% 
of prostate cancer patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy were diagnosed 
with a fracture at any location over a 4 year period.  These findings highlight both the 
broad nature of the important clinical effects of ADT on the skeleton and the overall 
frequency of these events.  Based on this data, the subject incidence of fracture at any 
location has been included as a secondary efficacy endpoint in study 20040138 to 
enable an assessment of the effects of AMG 162 compared to placebo on overall 
skeletal morbidity associated with androgen deprivation therapy.  

The incidence of fracture at any site in ADT subjects reported by Shahinian et al over a 
4 year period (19.4%), is lower than the rate initially reported by Krupski et al (25.9% 
over a 2-year period) for a similar patient population.  The subjects in the Shahinian 
publication appear to be similar in key demographic features such as age to the subjects 
in study 20040138 and the fracture rate would be expected to be similar.  Ongoing 
monitoring of fracture rates in the pooled blinded patient population to date reveals that 
the fracture rate is lower than what was originally expected based on data provided by 
Krupski et al, 2003 and slightly lower than the one in the Shahinian study.  The calcium 
and vitamin D supplementation in study 20040138 may contribute to the lower overall 
fracture rate.  Based on this recent information, study duration has been increased from

2 to 3 years to increase the time period for fracture rates to be recorded.  In addition, a 
3-year study duration for evaluation of fractures is consistent with regulatory guidance 
for the development of therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women, including an ongoing phase III study evaluating AMG 162 for that condition.  
Increasing the study duration to 3 years does not impose undue risk for subjects 
because all patients in study 20040138 will continue to be supplemented with calcium 
and vitamin D as best available standard of care.  

The newly implemented secondary efficacy endpoints are pre-specified and prioritized 
using a hierarchical order of hypothesis testing along with the Hochberg multiplicity 
adjustment procedure as outlined in Section 10.5.1.  While all secondary endpoints 
are maintained, the order of their testing is being changed to a new algorithm: all 
BMD-related endpoints will be tested first, followed by testing of the fracture-
related endpoints.  Based on recently published information with antiresorptive 
therapy suggesting there is adequate power to detect a difference in subject 
incidence of new vertebral fracture at month 36 (Black et al, 2007), and 
recognizing that this endpoint is the preferred one for regulatory approval of anti-
resorptive therapies, Amgen believes that the most appropriate testing strategy 
for fracture related endpoints is a combined testing of subject incidence of any 
fracture at 36 months together with subject incidence of new vertebral fracture at 
36 months using the Hochberg procedure. 

Biochemical markers of bone turnover are a part of predictors of the risk of fractures as 
they represent higher levels of bone loss.  The relationship between early decreases in 
bone turnover markers (BTM) and the effect of therapy on reduction of risk of fractures is 
less certain than using BMD measurements alone.  This study will explore the 
relationship between changes in BTM and changes in BMD as well as fracture risk.  
Bone resorption markers serum carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) and 
serum type I procollagen N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) are selected to monitor the bone 
turnover rate.  Based on a previous study, the MORE study, there was a statistically 
significant change in P1NP levels from baseline and may be predictive of the risk 
reduction in fracture seen with raloxifene therapy.  In addition, changes in P1NP levels 
significantly predicted changes in BMD with clodronate therapy (Reginster et al, 2004; 
Cummings et al, 2002; Saarto et al, 1998).

Placebo-Controlled Trials 

In spite of the fact that there are no currently approved therapies for the treatment of 
bone loss associated with hormone ablative therapy, questions are often raised about 
the placebo-control group of subjects.  In this trial, “placebo-control” is actually provided 
in the form of adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D.  In a metanalysis of 
15 trials in postmenopausal women (Shea et al, 2002), randomized to calcium 
supplementation or usual calcium intake in the diet, calcium alone reduced bone loss in 
the lumbar spine, the hip and total body.  The relative risk of vertebral and nonvertebral 
fractures was reduced.  In a 3-year community intervention study in elderly individuals, 
there was a 16% reduction in fracture incidence rate (RR 0.84) among male and female 
residents offered a calcium and vitamin D supplementation program (Larsen et al, 2004).  
In elderly U.S. subjects with a mean age of 71 years, daily treatment with 500 mg of 
calcium and 700 IU of vitamin D significantly reduced the total number of nonvertebral 
fractures (Dawson-Hughes et al, 1997).  Currently, supplemental calcium and vitamin D 
is the standard of care in osteoporotic patients, yet few patients receive appropriate 
supplementation.  

In addition, although therapies exist to reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis, 
some issues remain unsettled.  Not all therapies are suitable for all patients and 
therapies vary in their effectiveness for all types of fracture.  Additional data are needed 
to assess onset of action, efficacy in elderly, vulnerable populations, efficacy in non-
Caucasians, efficacy at the hip and extraskeletal effects are some of the unanswered 
questions about various agents.   

Early Assessments 

AMG 162 has a rapid onset of action; therefore we anticipate, based on the phase II 
clinical trial that significant changes in BMD will be obtained as early as one month.  
Current guidelines (National Osteoporosis Foundation, The Endocrine Society, American 
College of Rheumatology, American College of Clinical Endocrinologists, American 
College of Physicians) suggest that measurement of BMD should be no more often than 
yearly due to the instrument precision and the relatively slow action of anti-resorptive 
agents.  This has been a source of frustration to clinicians and patients who would prefer 
to be able to assess efficacy at a much earlier time point.  In an analogy with 
measurement of blood pressure and compliance with anti-hypertensive medication,

Page 25 of 124
Page 25 of 108 

previous studies have indicated that the measurement of BMD enhances the compliance 
with therapy for osteoporosis.  Thus, feedback to the patient early in the course of 
treatment can enhance outcomes overall.   

Clinical practice is changing the paradigm of measuring BMD at 12 months.  Several 
scientific issues have been clarified about bone biology that makes earlier 
measurements of BMD feasible and informative.  It has been recognized that bone loss 
in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is rapid, and current recommendations are to 
measure BMD at initiation of glucocorticoid treatment and at 6 months (American 
College of Rheumatology).  Secondly, with the approval of anabolic agents, Teriparatide 
treatment results in rapid changes in BMD such that many clinicians measure BMD at 
earlier time points to determine efficacy and limit treatment time.  AMG 162 has a rapid 
onset of action resulting in a rapid change in BMD in the Phase II clinical trial.  Due to 
this rapid onset of action, significant differences in BMD can be noted as early as 
1 month.   

Most registration trials for osteoporosis agents assessed BMD at baseline, 3, 6 and 
12 months.  Amgen proposes assessing BMD at 1-month as well as at 3 months.  This 
will allow rapid determination of efficacy and compliance.  We anticipate that early BMD 
measurements will replace bone biochemical markers as an assessment of efficacy in 
the future. 

2.4 

Clinical Hypothesis 

AMG 162 will preserve BMD in men with PC undergoing ADT.  This study is designed to 
detect, a 2% difference in the percent change in lumbar spine BMD between the 
AMG 162 treatment group and placebo group (calcium and vitamin D only) after 2 years 
of randomized treatment.  In addition, AMG 162 will preserve BMD at the femoral neck 
and total hip, and, if effective at preserving BMD, will prevent fracture.  AMG 162 will 
have a safety profile that is consistent with previous studies and will not adversely 
impact clinical outcomes.

be enrolled in this study.  Subjects will be randomized in a blinded fashion to 1 of 
2 treatment arms using a 1:1 randomization ratio.  The randomization schedule will use 
randomly permuted blocks, and will be stratified based on the age group ((cid:31) 70 vs. 
(cid:116) 70 years old), and duration of ADT with GnRH agonist, or orchiectomy at the time of 
study entry ((cid:100) 6 months vs. > 6 months).  A total of approximately 613 subjects will be 
assigned to each treatment arm.  

1. 

2. 

Placebo SC every 6 months (n = 613) 

60 mg AMG 162 SC every 6 months (n = 613) 

All subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility (screened) after informed consent is 
signed and dated.  All screening procedures should be completed within 35 days before 
randomization.  After the initial dose of investigational product is administered subjects 
will be followed for 36 months.  Safety data including clinical fracture information will be 
collected by clinic visit or telephone contact approximately every 6 months for up to 
2 years after the 36-month treatment phase (clinic visits preferred). 

During the treatment phase, all subjects will receive the same volume of study 
medication (AMG 162 or placebo) every 6 months and daily supplemental calcium (1 g) 
plus vitamin D (at least 400 IU).   

The final analysis will be conducted after all subjects have had an opportunity to 
complete 3 years of randomized treatment.  In addition, data from the safety follow-up 
phase will be summarized as well. 

A study month is defined as a calendar month. 

The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the protocol 
synopsis section.  The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.2.1. 

3.2 

Number of Centers 

Approximately 175 investigative sites will participate in the study.  Sites will be located in 
North America, and Europe.  Sites that do not enroll subjects within 2 months of site 
initiation may have their contract terminated.

3.3 

Number of Subjects 

Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  Approximately 
1226 subjects will be enrolled into 2 treatment arms.  It is anticipated that, on average, 
approximately 9 to 10 subjects will enroll at each investigative site.  Subjects not 
completing the study will not be replaced. 

The dropout rate is estimated to be approximately 10% per year.  The rationale for the 
number of subjects required is outlined in Section 10.3.  

All subjects who complete the 36-month treatment phase will be asked to participate in 
the safety follow-up phase.  This may include subjects who ended IP early but remained 
on study for observation only through the Month 36 visit. 

3.4 

Estimated Study Duration 

Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 36 months.  The screening 
phase will occur within the 35 days before randomization, for a maximal subject 
participation of approximately 37 months.  Recruitment is anticipated to take 
approximately 8 months, resulting in total study duration of approximately 45 months. 

3.4.1 

Safety Follow Up Phase 

The end of study visit is scheduled to occur at the end of the 36-month treatment phase.  
Safety data including clinical fracture information will continue to be collected by clinic 
visit or telephone contact approximately every 6 months for up to 2 years after the 
36-month treatment phase.  

4. 

SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY 

Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (ie, gender, 
age, race,) and outcome of the screening process (eg, enrolled into study, reason for 
ineligibility, or refused to participate).

SUBJECT ENROLLMENT 

Before subjects may be entered into the study, Amgen requires a copy of the site’s 
written independent ethics committee/institutional review board (IEC/IRB) approval of the 
protocol, informed consent form, and all other subject information and/or recruitment 
material, if applicable (see Section 12.3).  All subjects or legally acceptable 
representatives must personally sign and date the consent form before enrollment. 

The enrollment date is defined as the date the subject is randomized. 

5.1 

Subject Identification Number Assignment 

All subjects who enter into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the informed consent) will be assigned a 9-digit subject 
identification number by an interactive voice response system (IVRS) after they sign the 
IEC/IRB approved informed consent form and before the first study related procedure is 
performed.   

Site personnel must call the IVRS to obtain a subject identification number.  Screening 
subject identification numbers will be assigned in sequential order beginning with 
138XXX001, with “XXX” = site number.  This number will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the screening period, treatment phase, and safety follow up phase and and 
must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  The subject 
identification number must remain constant throughout the entire trial; it must not be 
changed at the time of re-screening, enrollment, or randomization.  This number will not 
be the same as the randomization number assigned for the study.

5.2 

Randomization  

Randomization to placebo or AMG 162 will be based on a double-blind randomization 
schedule prepared by Amgen before the start of the study.  Subjects will be randomized 
using a 1:1 allocation to one of 2 treatment groups as outlined in Table 2, and must be 
randomized within 72 hours prior to scheduled study Day 1 (day of first dose).  The 
randomization schedule will use randomly permuted blocks, and will be stratified based 
on age group (< 70 vs. (cid:116) 70 years old), and duration of ADT with GnRH agonist or 
orchiectomy ((cid:100) 6 months vs. > 6 months) at the time of study entry.  A subject will be 
considered randomized once a randomization number is assigned.  A subject may only 
be randomized once, and each randomization number may only be assigned to one 
subject.

TREATMENT PROCEDURES 

Dose selection justification 

The Phase 2 study (20010223) included both osteoporotic (lumbar spine BMD t-score  
< -2.5) and osteopenic (lumbar spine BMD t-score (cid:3)< -1.8 but (cid:116) -2.5) subjects.  AMG 162 
was effective in both groups and the dose response relationship was similar in both 
groups.  Therefore, data from this study were used in dose selection.  

Both 6-monthly and 3-monthly dosing of AMG 162 appeared to be effective in the 
phase 2 study.  Due to greater convenience and potentially greater compliance, a 
6-monthly schedule was selected for the current study.

Evaluation of the BMD data at all anatomic sites, as well as serum CTX and urine 
NTX/creatinine, indicated that the 60 mg 6-monthly AMG 162 dose provided a response 
that was closest to the plateau phase of the dose response curve.  A 14 mg 6-monthly 
dose was effective in increasing BMD and decreasing bone turnover marker levels, but 
was sub optimal compared to the 60-mg 6-monthly dose of AMG 162. 

Based on the safety profile from previous studies, no dose-limiting toxicities have been 
observed. 

The pharmacokinetic profiles showed that 60 mg 6-monthly provides adequate AMG 162 
levels for most subjects over the 6-month period.  The mean AMG 162 level at the end 
of the 6-month period was approximately 100 ng/mL, which is adequate to ensure a 
biologic response.  The ED50 for bone turnover response is estimated to be 5 ng/mL.  
The serum concentration for the 14-mg 6-monthly group was below the quantifiable limit 
at month 6 in all subjects indicating inadequate AMG 162 coverage for the 6-monthly 
period.  Following 2 or 3 doses of AMG 162, there did not appear to be significant drug 
accumulation or change in the clearance profile of AMG 162. 

AMG 162 doses of (cid:116) 60 mg 6-monthly appeared to be at least as effective as 
alendronate 70 mg weekly based on BMD and bone turnover marker responses. 

In conclusion, an AMG 162 dose of 60 mg administered once every 6 months appears to 
be optimal based on the BMD, bone turnover, safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles. 

6.2 

Investigational Product Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 

AMG 162/placebo will be administered as a SC injection, which must be administered by 
a health care professional on the scheduled study visit after all other study visit 
procedures have been completed. 

Each site will be supplied with 2 types of blinded study boxes, which will contain either a 
vial of placebo or a vial of 60 mg AMG 162 for the preparation of a 1.0 mL SC injection.  
Blinded study boxes will not be pre-assigned to specific subjects.  Once a subject is 
ready for his initial or on-study scheduled dose, the site personnel will call the IVRS 
vendor to obtain a box number assignment.  Please refer to specific instructions 
provided by the IVRS vendor for additional information.

There have been no reports of overdose with this product.  The highest dose tested in 
clinical trials is 210 mg SC administered every 6 months.  It is possible that an overdose 
may result in hypocalcemia.  Hypocalcemia, if severe, should be managed by oral or 
parenteral calcium replacement, as clinically indicated. 

If a subject misses a scheduled SC injection, then they should return to the clinic as 
soon as possible for investigational product administration (preferably no later than 
45 days after their scheduled dose).  If more than 45 days has elapsed since the missed 
dose, please contact the study manager or designee for specific instructions. 

Specific details regarding dose preparation can be found in the Pharmacy Guide 
(Appendix F). 

The dosing schedule is described by a schema in the protocol synopsis.

Subjects must be instructed to fast at least 8 hours before serum sample collection at 
the following visits:  Day 1, Month 1, Month 6, Month 12, Month 24 and Month 36.  
Investigational product administration should occur after all study visit procedures have 
been completed.  Specific details of all tests and procedures are outlined below. 

All screening procedures must be completed within 35 days before day of 
randomization.   

Enrollment date is defined as the date of randomization.  Day 1 visit is defined as the 
day that the initial dose of investigational product is administered to the subject.  
Planned start of investigational product is within 72 hours of randomization. 

A study month is defined as a calendar month.   

Study Windows: 

All tests and procedures scheduled for Month 1 should be performed (cid:114) 7 days of the 
scheduled day.  Tests and procedures scheduled for Month 3 through Month 36 should 
be performed (cid:114) 14 days of the scheduled day.  Any missed visits or tests not done, and 
examinations that are not conducted must be reported as such on the case report forms.   

Study procedures for a specific visit (eg, Month 1) may be completed on multiple days as 
long as the visit window is maintained and the PRO assessment is administered without 
bias.  It is recommended that all imaging procedures be completed on the first day.  All 
other study procedures would be completed on the subsequent day (PRO must be 
administered first and investigational drug must be administered last). 

During the safety follow up phase, clinical visits or telephone contacts should be 
performed within (cid:114) 8 weeks of the scheduled visit date. 

Data collection:   

All laboratory values will be electronically transferred from the laboratory to the Amgen 
clinical database.  Specific details can be found in the data transfer plan for the central 
lab.  Imaging data (radiographs, DXA) will be captured by the central imaging vendor, 
and specific details can be found in the data transfer plan for the central imaging vendor.  
All other data will be captured on the case report form.

Medical History 

The subjects’ complete medical history will be obtained prior to enrollment and recorded 
on the case report form.  A detailed history of the subject’s cancer and of all fractures will 
also be obtained.  

7.2 

Medication History 

Information on all medications administered within one week before study Day 1 will be 
recorded on the case report form.  In addition, information on all known previous 
bisphosphonate use will be recorded on the case report form.  

Information on all medications, surgical procedures, and radiotherapy specifically used 
to treat the subject’s cancer prior to study day 1 will be recorded on the case report form.   

7.3 

Physical Examination 

All physical examinations should include height and weight.  The baseline physical 
examination is not required if the screening physical examination was performed within 
1 week before study day 1. 

7.4 

Bone Scan 

A bone scan is required at screening and Month 36 to rule out bone metastasis.  If the 
DXA and bone scan are scheduled to be performed on the same day, then the DXA 
scan must be performed first.  The radioactive nucleotide used in the bone scan can 
interfere with the BMD measurement.  If the bone scan is performed first, then at least 
72 hours must elapse before the DXA scan is performed.   

A historical bone scan can be used to assess eligibility if: 

(cid:120)  Obtained within 6 month of starting current ADT ((cid:114) 6 months from the start date 
of the current ADT), and Screening visit PSA level is less than or equal to 1.  If 
Screening visit PSA level is > 1, then a repeat bone scan is required. 

OR 
(cid:120)  Obtained within 2 months of randomization and Screening visit PSA level is less 
than or equal to 1.  If Screening visit PSA level is > 1, then a repeat bone scan is 
required. 

It is not necessary to repeat bone scans for re-screening providing they meet the above 
criteria.

Laboratory Assessments  

All blood samples will be processed and sent to the central laboratory.  The central 
laboratory will be responsible for either completing assessments, or shipping samples to 
Amgen or a specialty laboratory for assay (depending on the assessment). 

The central laboratory will be responsible for all screening and on-study serum 
chemistry, hematology, testosterone, PSA, 25-hydroxyvitamin D tests and iPTH.  Amgen 
or designee will be responsible for AMG 162 serum levels and AMG 162 antibody 
assessments, and a specialty laboratory will be responsible for all bone marker 
assessments.  Biomarker assay samples will be archived for possible future analysis 
(Section 7.6.1).  

The central laboratory will provide a study manual that outlines handling, labeling, and 
shipping procedures for all serum samples. 

All blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture before investigational product 
administration, if applicable, at the time points outlined in Appendix A.  Subjects should 
be fasting at least 8 hours for the following study visits:  Day 1, Month 1, Month 6, 
Month 12, Month 24 and Month 36.  The total volume of blood drawn from a subject 
throughout the study (total of 36 months) will be approximately 220 mL.  Average volume 
of blood drawn per visit will be approximately 20 mL, and will not exceed 35 mL.  The 
date and time of blood collection will be recorded in the subjects’ medical record.  
Table 3 outlines the specific analytes for the serum chemistry and hematology 
assessments, as well as other assessments to be conducted on blood samples. 

To maintain the integrity of the study blind, Month 1 lab results for serum calcium or 
albumin-adjusted calcium, and phosphorus will not be reported to the sites.  Instead, the 
term “BLINDED” will appear in the results column and in the reference range column.  
To ensure adequate safety oversight, if there is a change in the serum level of any of 
these analytes , to CTCAE grade 3 or greater, the investigative site will be notified via 
fax of the absolute analyte value.  Also, all on study alkaline phosphatase results will be 
blinded to the sites however, if there is a change in the serum level of alkaline 
phosphatase to CTCAE grade 3 or greater, the investigative site will be notified via fax of 
the absolute analyte value.

In addition to testing the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug AMG 162 in 
this study, Amgen may attempt to develop blood test(s) designed to identify patients 
most likely to benefit from AMG 162.  Such biomarker development is pursued by use of 
advanced biochemical analyses, such as proteomic methods.   

Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biological 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention.  In oncology, there is particular interest in the molecular changes underlying 
the oncogenic processes that may identify cancer subtypes, stage disease, assess the

amount of tumor growth or predict disease progression, metastasis and responses to 
AMG 162.  These investigations may be useful in developing markers to identify disease 
subtypes, guide therapy and/or predict disease progression. 

Serum samples obtained for exploratory purposes may be stored for up to 5 years at an 
Amgen designated central laboratory to research scientific questions related to cancer 
and AMG 162.  To maximize confidentiality, all samples and the information associated 
with them will be coded to prevent the exposure of the subject’s information and identity.  
This coding process allows Amgen to have the samples destroyed at the subject’s 
request.  The subject will continue to retain the right to have the biochemical analysis 
and biomarker development samples destroyed at any time by contacting the Principal 
Investigator.  Amgen is responsible for the destruction of these sample(s) at the request 
of the research subject through the Principal Investigator, or at the end of the storage 
period.  The Principal Investigator will provide Amgen with the required study and 
subject numbers, so that any remaining serum samples and any other components from 
the cells can be located and destroyed.  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, Amgen will own the commercial product and there are no plans for the 
subject to receive financial rewards or compensation for the commercial product, data, 
information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample(s). 

Please refer to the laboratory manual for detailed collection and handling procedures for 
all Biomarker Development samples. 

7.7 

Calcium and Vitamin D Supplements 

All subjects will take supplements containing at least 1-gram of calcium during the 
treatment phase.  Calcium may be withheld at the discretion of the investigator if there 
are any safety concerns. 

A baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level will be measured.  Subjects with  
25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 12 ng/mL will not be eligible to enroll into the study, they 
may be treated and re-screened.  If the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is 12-20 ng/mL, then 
the subject will be instructed to take at least 800 IU Vitamin D daily.  All other subjects 
should be instructed to take at least 400 IU Vitamin D daily.  Vitamin D dosage may be 
altered due to differences in regional availability.

7.8 

Dual X ray Absorptiometry (DXA) Assessment 

All subjects will be requested to undergo bone densitometry assessments of the lumbar 
spine and proximal femur (hip) performed by DXA per the schedule outlined in 
Appendix A.   

GE Lunar or Hologic bone densitometers able to perform Vertebral Fracture Assessment 
(VFA) should be used for the study (Hologic describes VFA as IVA [instant vertebral 
assessment] and Lunar describes VFA as DVA [dual energy vertebral assessment]).  
Study sites without access to a DXA machine with VFA capability will be required to 
perform lateral spine radiographs in lieu of the VFA assessment at Month 6.  Norland 
bone densitometers are not to be used for the study. 

The same DXA machine must be used for all study procedures for a particular subject.   
The left side should be used for the proximal femur scans, unless prohibited, eg, hip 
implant.  Lumbar spine scans must include L1 through L4.  Detailed instructions for scan 
acquisition will be in a separate manual provided by the central imaging center.  

For distal radius, the left side should be used for all scans at all study visits.  If another 
site must be used or is inadvertently used at baseline, then it must be used consistently 
throughout the study. 

7.8.1 

Screening DXA 

Densitometry measurements of both the lumbar spine and the proximal femur must be 
performed and analyzed by the local DXA technician to determine subject eligibility.  
These scans will serve as the baseline scans if the subject is deemed eligible.  It is 
important to use the male normative database for t-scores.  Subsequently, these scans 
must be submitted to the central imaging facility, which will reanalyze the scans for the 
inclusion in the study database. 

Lumbar spine vertebrae that are clearly fractured (visible on the DXA scan) must be 
excluded from the DXA analysis in order to determine eligibility.  Subjects must have at 
least 2 evaluable lumbar vertebrae to be eligible for the study. 

For subjects < 70 years of age the BMD must be more than 1.0 standard deviation below 
peak bone mass (ie, t-score < -1.0, at any one of the following sites: lumbar spine, total 
hip, or femoral neck) or a historical osteoporotic fracture.  For all subjects the t-score 
must not be lower than -4.0 at any one of these sites.

If a subject is re-screened, DXA scans and radiographs do not need to be repeated if 
obtained within 2 months of randomization.   

7.8.2 

On Study DXA 

On-study bone densitometry assessments will be measured at the spine, proximal 
femur, distal radius (DXA sub-study only), and total body (DXA sub-study only).  For the 
proximal femur the left side should be used for all scans at all study visits.  If the right 
side must be used (eg, hip implant) or is inadvertently used at baseline, then it must be 
used consistently throughout the study. 

All DXA scan data will be submitted electronically to the central imaging center for final 
blinded analysis.  The results from the central imaging center will be used as the final 
dataset.  Vertebrae that are unevaluable will be excluded from the lumbar spine DXA 
analysis. 

After analysis by the central imaging center, the study site may be asked to re-acquire a 
scan, eg, because of malpositioning or other technical reasons.  The investigative sites 
must comply with the requests from the central imaging center.  The central imaging 
center will require that all study centers scan a set of standard phantoms at least once 
on the DXA machines used for this study.  This will be done in order to monitor DXA 
machine performance across study centers.  Detailed instructions will be provided 
separately. 

The central imaging center will monitor BMD over the course of the study.  Investigators 
will be alerted to any subjects who lose more than 7% bone mass at the lumbar spine or 
total hip within any 12-month period of the study or who have a t-score < -4 at the total 
hip or lumbar spine at any point during the course of the study.  In this case, it is the 
obligation of the investigator to consider the subject’s status and to determine future 
management, including alternative therapies. 

7.9 

Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) by DXA 

For assessment of an early treatment effect, VFA by DXA will be done at baseline and 
6 months.  For subject convenience, the baseline VFA procedure may be done 
immediately after determination of BMD eligibility during the screening period.

The study center will acquire the scan for VFA, and the central imaging center will 
conduct the analysis.  If there is a suspected vertebral fracture at 6 months based on 
central evaluation of the VFA scan, lateral spine radiographs will be acquired to confirm 
the presence of a vertebral fracture. 

For those study sites without access to VFA technology, lateral spine radiographs will be 
required at 6 months in lieu of the VFA scan.  

7.10 

Lateral Spine Radiographic Assessments 

Radiographs of the lateral thoracic and lumbar spine will be acquired according to 
specific instructions provided by the central imaging vendor per the schedule outlined in 
Appendix A.  The month 6 radiographs should only be conducted if a vertebral fracture is 
suspected based on VFA assessment (Section 7.8), or if VFA technology is not available 
at the sites to conduct the VFA assessment.  If a subject presents with acute back pain 
at a time point other than when a scheduled spinal radiograph is obtained, and 
occurrence of a vertebral fracture is suspected, the investigator should obtain a lateral 
spinal radiograph and submit it to the central imaging facility for evaluation.   

Vertebral fractures will be identified by visual inspection by an expert radiologist (at the 
central imaging center) of digitized images of spinal radiographs taken.  

No imaging will be required during the safety follow up phase of the study. 

For assessment of prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline, a generally accepted 
semiquantitative grading scale will be used (Genant et al, 1993): Grade 0, normal; 
Grade 1, 20 to 25% reduction in vertebral height (anterior, middle, or posterior); Grade 2, 
25% to 40% reduction in height; Grade 3, greater than 40% reduction in height. 

For assessment of incident vertebral fracture, radiographs will be scored blinded to 
treatment but not to sequence.  The semiquantitative grading scale will be used.  A 
secondary endpoint of this study is the incidence of new vertebral fractures (ie, fractures 
in previously undeformed vertebrae).  Worsening of pre-existing vertebral fractures will 
also be assessed.  Worsening is defined as an increase of at least 1 grade on the 
semiquantitative scale.

Information about any new non-vertebral fractures while on study will be recorded.  A 
copy of radiographs or other diagnostic images such as computerized tomography (CT) 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirming the fracture, and/or a copy of the 
radiology report, surgical report or discharge surgical report summary should be 
obtained and included in the subject’s study records.  Copies of the radiographs, 
diagnostic images and/or radiology report, or discharge summary will be submitted to the 
central imaging center for confirmation of fracture.  If the radiograph or diagnostic image 
is not available, then at minimum, a copy of the radiology report, surgical report or 
discharge summary should be submitted to the central imaging vendor.

Bone and Cartilage Marker  

All enrolled subjects will have their Type I CTX, P1NP, and Trap 5b levels monitored per 
the schedule outlined in Appendix A to assess the effect of AMG 162 treatment on bone 
turnover and other bone parameters.  Subjects must be fasting for at least 8 hours prior 
to serum collection. 

7.13 

Concomitant Therapy 

All concomitant medications, including over-the-counter products, administered while the 
subject is enrolled in the study must be recorded on the case report form, listing generic 
name or trade name, indication, quantity administered, and date(s) of administration.

Patient Reported Outcome Assessments  

During the treatment phase of the study, Patient Reported Outcomes Assessment 
(PROA) questionnaires will be given to subjects to complete before any other medical 
care is delivered to the subject on the day of the assessment.   

The EQ-5D is comprised of 6 questions evaluating the health related quality of life 
(HRQOL) domains of physical, mental and social functioning.  The first 5 questions 
recognize the following quality of life dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.  Each of these questions has a simple 
3-category response scale.  The last question is represented by a 20-cm vertical VAS, 
scored from 0 to 100 asking the patient to “mark your own health state today”.  These 
6 questions will take approximately 2 minutes to complete. 

The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument 
designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment.  The 
EPIC contains four scales that are calculated and reported separately:  Urinary, Bowel, 
Sexual and Hormonal Function.  Only Hormonal function will be used for this study 
(Appendix G). 

7.15 

Adverse Events 

Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events at day 1 visit through month 36, and 
collected by clinic visit or telephone contact approximately every 6 months for up to 
2 years after the 36-month treatment period if participating in the safety follow up phase.  
If the subject is removed from study medication, every effort should be made to continue 
evaluating adverse events through their last visit, “End of Study” (month 36), or through 
the end of the 2 year follow up phase.  See Section 8.1 for further details regarding 
minimal assessments requested.  Adverse events will be recorded on the case report 
form beginning on Study Day 1, at the time of initial investigational product 
administration.  See Section 9 for details on adverse events.

REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS 

Removal of Subjects 

Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to his or her future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
The investigator and sponsor also have the right to withdraw subjects from the study in 
the event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, protocol violation, or other reasons.   

Any subject who withdraws consent to participate in the study will be removed from 
further treatment and/or study observation immediately upon the date of request.  During 
the treatment phase, a complete final evaluation (defined as procedures scheduled for 
End of Study visit) should be completed at time of subject’s withdrawal.  Images 
(radiographs, DXA scans, bone scan) obtained 8 weeks before the End of Study visit do 
not need to repeated.  Should a subject (or a legally acceptable representative) request 
or decide to withdraw from the treatment phase of the study, all efforts will be made to

complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of 
withdrawal.  All information should be reported on the applicable case report forms. 

The subject who requests to stop study treatment or has withdrawn from study treatment 
because of the investigator’s or sponsor’s concern before completion of the 
protocol-specified treatment duration will continue the schedule of study observations, 
provided the subject has not withdrawn full consent.   

The reason for withdrawal must be documented on the end of study case report form.  If 
the subject is withdrawn due to an adverse event, arrangements should be made for the 
subject to have follow-up visits until the adverse event has resolved or stabilized.   

Reasons for removal from investigational product might include: 

Ineligibility 

(cid:120)  Withdrawal of consent 
(cid:120)  Administrative decision by the investigator or Amgen 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120)  Significant protocol deviation 
(cid:120)  Patient noncompliance
(cid:120)  Adverse event (includes disease progression; report on adverse event CRF) 

 
During the treatment phase, subjects who develop any bone metastasis will be required 
to withdraw from the study.  Withdrawal from the study is not required if a subject 
develops distant metastatic disease at non bone sites or local recurrence 

During the safety follow up phase, subjects may withdraw their consent to participate at 
any time.  Alternately, subjects may be removed from the safety follow up phase of the 
study via an administrative decision by the investigator or Amgen.

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 

Definitions  

9.1.1 

Adverse Events 

Page 46 of 124
Page 46 of 108 

An adverse event is an undesirable medical occurrence (sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or 
worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (diabetes, congestive heart failure, 
rheumatoid arthritis) that occurs after initiation of investigational product whether or not 
considered to be investigational product related. 

A worsening of an existing medical condition is one that was present at baseline (eg, 
cancer, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) and became more severe, more frequent, 
or increased in duration during investigational product treatment. 

Abnormal laboratory values should not be reported as adverse events; however, any 
clinical consequences of the abnormality should be reported as adverse events. 

9.1.2 

Serious Adverse Events 

A serious adverse event is defined by regulatory agencies as one that suggests a 
significant hazard or side effect, regardless of the investigator or sponsor’s opinion on 
the relationship to investigational product.  This includes, but may not be limited to, any 
event that (at any dose): 

Is fatal 
Is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 

(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120)  Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 

Is a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

 
A hospitalization meeting the regulatory requirement for the “serious” criteria is any 
inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health 
care facility. 

Any event that does not exactly meet this definition yet, in the investigator’s opinion 
represents a significant hazard can be assigned the “other significant hazard” regulatory 
reporting serious criteria.

Additionally, important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization but that may jeopardize the subject or require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or result in urgent 
investigation, may be considered serious.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, 
convulsions, and blood dyscrasias. 

SAEs will be collected and reported throughout the study duration beginning with the first 
dose of investigational product to the end of the safety follow up phase of the study.  If

Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 

All adverse events occurring after the first dose of investigational product observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject (whether or not attributed to investigational 
product), will be reported on the case report form.   

Medically significant adverse events considered related to the investigational product by 
the investigator or the sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable.  The 
investigator must assign the following attributes:  description; dates of onset and 
resolution; severity; assessment of relatedness to investigational product, and action 
taken.  The investigator may be asked to provide follow-up information. 

All deaths occurring on study must be reported to Amgen.  These include deaths within 
30 days of the last investigational product dose and deaths up to the last formal 
follow-up observational period (Month 36), whichever period is longer, continuing 
through the safety follow up phase.  For all deaths, available autopsy reports and 
relevant medical reports should be faxed to:

It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an adverse event is of 
sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment.  A subject may also 
voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable 
adverse event.  If either of these occurs, the subject must undergo an end-of-study 
assessment and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms 
cease or the condition becomes stable.  If the subject was permanently withdrawn from 
the study or investigational product due to a serious adverse event, this information must 
be included in either the initial or follow-up Serious Adverse Event Report Form, and in 
the End of Study Case Report Form. 

The study will use the latest version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events for grading adverse events that are experienced by research subjects 
(Appendix B).   

The severity of toxicities will be assessed on the following scale with appropriate clinical 
definitions:  Grade1 = mild adverse event, Grade 2 = moderate adverse event, 
Grade 3 = severe adverse event, Grade 4 = immediate life threatening adverse event, 
and Grade 5 = fatal adverse event.  

The relationship of adverse events to the investigational product will be assessed by 
means of the question: ‘Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by the investigational product?’  Answer Yes or No. 

These grading scales are further described in Appendix B. 

9.3 

Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures 

All serious adverse events must be reported to Amgen within 1 working day of discovery 
or notification of the event through all phases of the study.  Initial serious adverse event 
information and all amendments or additions must be recorded on a Serious Adverse 
Event Report Form (Appendix C) and faxed to Amgen Global Safety Operations.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Study Design 

Page 49 of 124
Page 49 of 108 

This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 3-year study (with a 
2-year safety follow up phase) in men undergoing ADT for non-metastatic PC.  This 
study is designed to evaluate the benefit of AMG 162 relative to placebo (calcium and 
vitamin D alone) in treating bone loss and reducing the subject incidence of any fracture 
and subject incidence of new vertebral fracture in this study population.  The 3-year 
analysis is the final analysis of the study.

10.2.2 

Subsets 

Safety analyses will include all subjects who receive at least one dose of investigational 
product. 

Primary efficacy analyses will test the hypothesis that there is no difference in percent 
change of BMD of the lumbar spine from baseline between subjects receiving AMG 162 
and subjects receiving placebo.  The analysis subset includes all subjects who 
contribute any meaningful information.  Therefore, the efficacy subset for 
evaluating subject incidence of new vertebral fracture will include all randomized 
subjects who have a baseline and (cid:149) 1 postbaseline evaluation of vertebral fracture 
at or prior to the time point under consideration.  The efficacy subset for evaluating 
subject incidence of any fracture, time to first clinical fracture and time to first 
non-vertebral fracture will be the full analysis set (FAS), which includes all subjects who 
were randomized.  Subjects in the FAS will be analyzed according to their original 
treatment assignment, regardless treatment received.   

Exploratory analyses will be conducted using all available subjects’ data at the time of 
analysis.

(cid:120)  Age group ((cid:31) 70 vs. (cid:116) 70) 
(cid:120)  Duration of ADT or orchiectomy at study entry ((cid:100) 6 months vs. > 6 months) 

10.3 

Sample Size Considerations 

Sample size considerations are based on the original protocol.  The sample size was 
calculated to provide adequate statistical power to detect the following based on the 
original testing strategy:   

(cid:120)  A 2% difference in lumbar spine BMD in the AMG 162 group as compared with 

the placebo group after 2 years of randomized treatment 

(cid:120)  A 45% reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fracture in the AMG 162 group 

as compared with the placebo group after 2 years of randomized treatment 

The primary analysis is a comparison of percentage change from baseline in lumbar 
spine BMD between AMG 162 and placebo after all subjects have had an opportunity of 
completing 2 years.    

The justification for the estimated incidence of new vertebral fracture for the control 
group and standard deviation of percentage change of lumbar spine BMD from baseline 
at 1 year is provided in the following sections.

Incidence of Vertebral Fracture 

Based on 1991-2001 claims data from a national random sample of 5% Medicare 
beneficiaries, the incidence rate of fracture over 2 years was 25.9%  
(Krupski et al, 2003).  A second population-based study of men with prostate cancer who 
underwent orchiectomy reported 267 fractures in 161 men during 191 person-years of 
follow up and 44.2% of fractures were thoracic/lumbar spine fractures  
(Melton et al, 2003).  Hence, the incidence of clinical vertebral fracture over 2 years is 
estimated to be 11.4%.    

Considering the incidence rate of new vertebral fracture will be higher than the incidence 
rate of clinical vertebral fracture by the nature of diagnosis, a new vertebral fracture 
incidence of 12% at year 2 was used in the calculation of sample size.     

Standard Deviation of Percentage Change of BMD for Lumbar Spine  

The SD is estimated in the range of 4.8% to 6.4% based on the previous studies 
(Smith et al, 2001, Smith et al, 2003), and a SD of 6.4% was used in the sample size 
calculation. 

Regarding the control of the type I error rate, the analysis of BMD at year 2 will be tested 
at the alpha level of 0.05.  The hypotheses of BMD and new vertebral fracture analyses 
at year 2 will be tested as follows: the hypothesis of new vertebral fracture at year 2 will 
be tested if the null hypothesis of BMD of the lumbar spine at year 2 is rejected at alpha 
level of 0.05.  In this way, the family wise error rate is under control in the “strong” sense 
at the level of 0.05. 

Based on the above assumptions, a sample size of 490 subjects per group will provide 
at least 95% power to detect 2% difference in percent change from baseline in lumbar 
spine BMD 2 years at the level of 0.05 using a 2-sided t-test, and 80% power to detect 
45% reduction in incidence of vertebral fracture at the level of 0.05 at year 2 using 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.  Assuming a dropout rate (or loss to follow-up for DXA 
assessment) of 10% per year, 613 subjects per group need to be enrolled.  If the percent 
change of BMD for lumbar spine null hypothesis is rejected, the incidence of the 
vertebral fracture hypothesis will be tested.  These sample sizes were calculated using 
NQuery version 5.

However, based on more recently available study results providing an updated 
estimate of the fracture rate (Shahinian et al, 2005), this study with the number of 
subjects enrolled will also provide adequate power to detect the treatment effect of 
reducing the risk of developing any fractures by 45% or reducing the risk of 
developing new vertebral fractures by 45% over 3 years.  

10.4 

External Data Monitoring Committee 

An external data monitoring committee (DMC) will be formed with members consisting of 
individuals chosen for their expertise in oncology and bone disease.  The primary role of 
independent DMC is to protect the safety of the study participants throughout the 
treatment phase (there will be no DMC meetings for the safety extension phase of the 
study).  They will accomplish this by reviewing safety and efficacy analysis results in 
order to assess the risk-benefit profile for subjects enrolled in this study.  Access to both 
safety and efficacy will provide the DMC a broad perspective with which to generate 
recommendations for appropriate actions.  The external individuals serving on the DMC 
will have access to subject’s individual treatment assignments.  To minimize the 
potential introduction of bias, these individuals will not have direct contact with the study 
site personnel or subjects.  The data for review are outlined in the DMC charter and 
agreed in advance by the DMC members.  Unblinded reports for review will be 
generated by an independent CRO that is external to Amgen as well.  This independent 
DMC will convene at a minimum twice yearly, and the start date will depend on subject 
accrual rates.  Records of all meetings will be archived.    

Efficacy data will be reviewed along with the safety data at all DMC data review 
meetings.  The purpose is to allow the DMC to balance any safety concerns with the 
potential for benefit, and to recommend stopping a trial if AMG 162 appears to be 
causing excess fractures.  The DMC is requested not to recommend early stopping for 
efficacy unless, in their opinion, the benefit is so dramatic that it would be unethical to 
continue treating patients with placebo.  The study should not stop unless the result for 
any fracture or new vertebral fracture achieves a p-value of 0.0005.  Consistent with 
the hierarchical testing procedure as described in the protocol, this would also require 
that the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD endpoints achieve a p-value of 
0.0005.  Due to the conservative nature of the statistical criteria described above, no 
alpha adjustment to the type 1 error at the final analysis (36-month treatment phase) is 
warranted.

10.5 

Planned Methods of Analysis 

10.5.1 

General Approach/Considerations 

The primary analytical approach for this study will use inferential testing to demonstrate 
that AMG 162 is effective in the treatment of bone loss.  All efficacy analyses will be 
performed by randomized treatment, regardless of treatment received.  

For computation of change from baseline endpoints, if the protocol specifies multiple 
baseline measurements to be taken, the mean of the baseline records will be used for 
analysis.  Otherwise, baseline will be taken as the observation recorded just prior to first 
dose of test article. 

Continuous variables will be summarized descriptively using mean, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum.  Median and other selected percentiles will be substituted for 
mean and standard deviation for parameters exhibiting a lack of normality.   

Frequencies and percentages will be presented for all categorical variables.  

The primary and secondary null hypotheses will be tested using the hierarchical analysis 
strategy and the Hochberg procedure to control the overall significance level of 0.05 at 
the 3-year final analysis: 

The primary null hypothesis will be tested first at a significance level of 0.05.  If the 
primary hypothesis is rejected, the secondary null hypotheses will be tested in a 
stepwise fashion over 5 steps at a significance level of 0.05.  No further test will be 
conducted if any one of hypotheses is not rejected at a previous step.  Some steps 
involve single null hypothesis and some involve multiple null hypotheses.  If there are 
multiple null hypotheses, the Hochberg procedure will be used to control for multiplicity 
and the testing will proceed to the next step only if all null hypotheses are rejected.  
These steps will involve the secondary null hypotheses for the following endpoints:

Analysis of Key Study Endpoints 

10.5.2.1  Efficacy Analysis 

Bone Mineral Density 

The analysis of the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD to months 1, 3, 
6, 12, 24 and 36 will employ an ANCOVA model analysis that includes treatment group 
(AMG 162 or placebo), stratification factors, baseline BMD value, machine type (Lunar 
or Hologic), and interaction between baseline BMD and machine type as covariates.  
Missing BMD data will be imputed with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method.  The point estimates for the least-squares means and the corresponding 
two-sided 95% confidence interval for the treatment differences (AMG 162 – placebo) at 
final analysis will be provided.  Additional methods for handling missing data will be 
applied to investigate the sensitivity of the primary analysis results to missing 
evaluations.  These sensitivity analyses will play a supportive role in the interpretation of 
the results. 

The analyses of BMD for total hip and femoral neck will be conducted in the same 
manner as the lumbar spine.

Any Fracture and Vertebral Fracture  

Page 56 of 124
Page 56 of 108 

Any fracture includes any non-traumatic1, non-metastatic fracture (excluding 
those at skull, facial, mandible, metacarpus, finger phalanges, and toe phalanges).  
Analysis of any fracture will employ a logistic regression model (Agresti, 1990) 
with the treatment group and stratification factors as covariates if the absolute 
difference in the overall dropout rates between the treatment groups is < 3%.  
Otherwise, analysis of any fracture will be based on the time to first any fracture 
using a Cox regression model (Lawless, 1982) with treatment group as the 
independent variable and stratified by the randomization stratification factors. 

Subject incidence of new vertebral fracture, and subject incidence of new or 
worsening vertebral fracture will be compared between the treatment groups using a 
logistic regression model with the treatment group and stratification factors as 
covariates.  The missing data will be imputed via LOCF in the primary analysis of 
vertebral fracture.  The sensitivity analysis with respect to the imputation of missing data 
will be performed. 

Clinical Fracture and Non-vertebral fracture  

Radiographs (or equivalent) of any non-vertebral fractures that occur will be obtained.  
For subjects who do not experience a non-vertebral fracture during the 36-month 
randomized treatment phase, their time to developing non-vertebral fracture will be 
censored at their last observation time on treatment phase of the study.  All non-
traumatic, non-metastatic, non-vertebral fractures, excluding those at the following 
sites: skull, facial, mandible, cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar 
vertebrae, metacarpus, finger phalanges, and toe phalanges, will be included in this 
analysis.  Clinical fractures include all non-vertebral and clinically evident non-
traumatic, non-metastatic fractures at cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, and 
lumbar vertebrae.   

Time to first clinical fracture analysis will be conducted between AMG 162 and placebo 
groups using a Cox regression model (Lawless, 1982) with treatment group as the 
independent variable and stratified by the randomization stratification factors.  The 
hazard ratio and its confidence interval compared with placebo will be reported.  The 

                                                 
1 Non traumatic fractures include falls from less than 20 inches (including falls from less than standing 
height, steps, curbs and stairs) and/or unknown, minimal to moderate trauma.

time to first clinical fracture will be summarized via displays of number of subjects at risk, 
the percentage of subject that are censored, median, two-tailed 95% confidence 
intervals for the median, and Kaplan-Meier event rates at the time of analysis.  The 
Kaplan-Meier graphs will also be presented for all treatment groups.  Time to first 
non-vertebral fracture will be analyzed in a similar manner as time to first clinical 
fracture.  

Both frequencies of subjects and incidence rates will be displayed by treatment group for 
any clinical fracture and non-vertebral fracture. 

Bone Metabolism 

Bone markers will be analyzed using non-parametric methodology since it is anticipated 
that the distribution of these parameters will deviate markedly from normality.  The 
stratified Rank sum test will be used to compare treatment groups. 

10.5.2.2  Safety Analysis  

Adverse Events 

All AEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  The primary analysis of adverse 
events will be descriptive.  Subject incidence rates of all adverse events reported during 
the 36-month treatment phase will be tabulated by system organ class, and preferred 
term, and severity.  Tables including “on-study” deaths, serious adverse events, and 
early withdrawals due to adverse events will be provided.  Narratives including those for 
deaths and serious adverse events will also be provided. 

In addition, subject incidence rates of all adverse events during the 24-month safety 
follow-up phase will be summarized. 

Clinical Laboratory Measurements 

Laboratory parameters will be summarized over time using shifts in recorded values 
from baseline to “worst” on-study value and from baseline to a particular visit.  Graphical 
representations of aggregate data may also be presented.  Continuously distributed 
analytes will be summarized descriptively using the number of non-missing 
observations, mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, minimum, and 
maximum.  Frequencies and percentages will be presented for categorical variables.

Cardiovascular (CV) Adjudication  

Page 58 of 124
Page 58 of 108 

AMG 162 will be compared with placebo with respect to cardiovascular events.  Only 
events confirmed positive by the adjudication committee to meet cardiovascular event 
definition criteria will be included for analysis.  Analyses will be performed based on 
the safety subset.  Kaplan-Meier curves are to be graphically displayed.  A Cox 
proportional hazard model (Lawless, 1982) with treatment groups and baseline CV risk 
level (defined below) as the independent variable will be used to assess the incidence 
of CV events over time.  The hazard ratio of AMG 162 compared with placebo and its 
corresponding 95% CI will be estimated.  

Cardiovascular risk: 

The cardiovascular risk level is assessed by assigning a risk score based on 
criteria listed in Table 4, which is adapted from the Multiple Outcomes of 
Raloxifene (MORE) study (Keech et al, 2005).  Subjects with a cardiovascular risk 
assessment score (cid:149) 4 points will be considered at high risk for cardiovascular 
events, and subjects with < 4 points will be considered at low risk for 
cardiovascular events.

Vital Signs, Height and Weight 

Blood pressure, pulse, temperature, height and weight will be summarized descriptively 
over time by visit using mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, minimum and 
maximum.  

Anti-AMG 162 Antibodies 

Immunogenic response will be described by tabulating the numbers of subjects who 
tested positive (binding, neutralizing) for anti-AMG 162 antibodies in the subjects 
receiving at least one dose of AMG 162.  Subjects who test positive for either binding or 
neutralizing antibodies against AMG 162 will be interpreted as persistently positive if the 
antibody status remains positive on repeat testing.  If a subject tests positive for 
neutralizing antibodies against AMG 162, the relationship between the presence of 
neutralizing antibodies, adverse events, and bone turnover will be evaluated.  
Immunogenic response will be listed by subject and visit date along with the serum 
AMG 162 levels. 

Pharmacokinetics 

Serum levels of AMG 162 will be summarized as the mean, median, standard deviation,

10.5.3.3  PSA Assessment 

The proportion of patients who show a defined change in PSA through 12, 24, and 
36 months will be provided to summarize and compare PSA assessment over 
scheduled visit adjusting for the following baseline PSA level, prostate cancer 
recurrence risk1 and stratification factors.

Subjects who had PSA > 0.5 ng/mL at baseline while on current ADT at baseline 
for > 1 month or had a PSA > 5.0 at baseline while on current ADT at baseline for  
(cid:148) 1 month are considered as having a high PSA level.  Otherwise, subjects are 
considered as having a low PSA level. 

Prostate Cancer Recurrence Risk 

The recurrence risk is defined as follows: 

(cid:120)  LOW: If primary tumor is T0 or T1 (including T1a-c), or T2a and regional

10.5.3.4  Overall Survival  

For surviving subjects, the overall survival will be censored at their last observation time 
during the 36-month treatment phase.  The overall survival analyses will be conducted to 
compare AMG 162 with placebo using a Cox regression model with treatment group, 
baseline cardiovascular risk, baseline PSA level, and prostate cancer recurrence risk 
as the independent variables.  Age group ((cid:31) 70 vs. (cid:116) 70 years old), and duration of ADT 
or orchiectomy at study entry ((cid:100) 6 months, > 6 months) will be used as stratification 
variables in the Cox regression model.  The overall survival will be summarized via 
displays of number of subjects at risk, the percentage of subjects that are censored, 
median, two-tailed 95% confidence intervals for the median, and Kaplan-Meier event 
mortality rates at the time of analysis.  The Kaplan-Meier graphs will also be presented 
for all treatment groups.   

10.5.3.5  Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Assessments 

Responses to the PRO assessments will be summarized at each of the protocol-
specified time points for fracture versus non-fracture populations by calculating the 
mean, SD, median, quartiles, and range of values.  The median and quartiles 
determined for each PROA score will be plotted against time for each treatment group 
for visual inspection of change over time.

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 

AMG 162 

AMG 162 will be presented as a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative free liquid in glass 
vials.  Formulation is 60 mg AMG 162 per mL of 10 mM Sodium Acetate, 5% sorbitol in 
water for injection, and has a pH of 5.2.  

Placebo will be presented in identical containers and the formulation will be identical to 
AMG 162 with the exception of the protein content.

 

Each box and the vial within the box will be labeled with a unique box number.  Upon the 
assignment of a box to a subject, the subject’s identification number and initials must be 
written on the box.

Unique boxes will be assigned for each dose the subject will receive while on study.  To 
obtain box number assignment for a scheduled dose, site personnel should call the 
IVRS.  The box number of investigational product is to be recorded on each subject’s 
case report forms.

In addition, the subject’s identification number, initials, randomization identification 
number and box number must be written on all appropriate drug accountability and 
dispensing records.   

Investigational Product Details including labeling, storage, preparation, etc. are provided 
in the Pharmacy Guide (Appendix F).

11.2 

Access to Blinded Investigational Product Assignment  

The identity of investigational product assigned to subjects or to individual boxes of 
investigational product will be contained in the IVRS.  Authorized site staff will be 
provided with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the IVRS to 
obtain unblinding information.  This PIN is unique to the individual and must not be 
shared. 

A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject.  Unblinding at the study 
site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. 

The principal investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Study Manager 
before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working 
day after the event and must document the unblinding in the subject’s case report form.

12.1 

REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  

Informed Consent 

An initial generic informed consent form is provided in Appendix H for the investigator to 
prepare the informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the 
template will be communicated by letter from the clinical study manager.  The written 
informed consent document should be prepared in the language(s) of the potential 
patient population.

Page 63 of 124
Page 63 of 108 

Before a subject’s participation in the trial, the investigator is responsible for obtaining 
written informed consent from the subject or legally acceptable representative (see note 
below) after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards of the study and before any protocol-specific screening procedures or 
any investigational products are administered.  A legally acceptable representative is an 
individual or other body authorized under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a 
prospective subject, to the subject’s participation in the clinical trial.  

The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject agrees to have 
his/her primary care physician informed of the subject’s participation in the clinical trial.  
If the subject agrees to such notification, the investigator shall inform the subject’s 
primary care physician of the subject’s participation in the clinical trial. 

The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician should be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the 
subject or a legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion (not necessarily an investigator).  The original signed 
informed consent form should be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a 
copy of the signed consent form should be provided to the subject or legally acceptable 
representative. 

If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the 
subject or legally acceptable representative and the witness must sign the informed 
consent form to attest that informed consent was freely given and understood.   

12.2 

Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board 

A copy of the protocol, proposed informed consent form, other written subject 
information, and any proposed advertising material must be submitted to the IEC/IRB for 
written approval.  A copy of the written approval of the protocol and informed consent 
form must be received by Amgen Inc. before recruitment of subjects into the study and 
shipment of investigational product.

The Amgen monitor is responsible for inspecting the case report forms at regular 
intervals approximately every 6 weeks throughout the study to verify adherence to the 
protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local 
regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The monitor should have access to 
subject medical records and other study-related records needed to verify the entries on 
the case report forms. 

The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing case 
report forms, are resolved. 

In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Clinical Quality Assurance Department (or 
designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories) 
and review of study-related records will occur to evaluate the trial conduct and 
compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 

All paper case report forms should be typed or filled out with a black ballpoint pen and 
must be legible. 

(cid:120)  Corrections to paper forms will be made by a single line stroke through the error 

and insertion of the correction above or beside the error.  The change must be 
initialed and dated by the investigator or a member of the study staff authorized 
by the investigator on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  No erasures, 
correction fluid, or tape may be used.  Corrections to electronic forms will be 
automatically documented through the software’s “audit trail”. 

(cid:120)  To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 

management review will be performed on subject data received at Amgen.  
During this review, subject data will be checked for consistency, omissions, and 
any apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data will be reviewed for adherence 
to the protocol and GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data 
management review process, data queries and/or site notifications will be sent to 
the site for completion and return to Amgen. 

(cid:120)  The principal investigator will sign and date the indicated places on the case 

report form.  These signatures will indicate that the principal investigator 
inspected or reviewed the data on the case report form, the data queries, and the 
site notifications, and agrees with the content. 

(cid:120)  Amgen’s clinical data management department will correct the database for the 

following CRF issues without notification to site staff:

Appendix F.  Pharmacy Guide 

AMG 162 

Packaging and Formulation 

AMG 162 will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc. and distributed using 
Amgen clinical trial drug distribution procedures.

AMG 162 and placebo will be presented as individual dose packs containing 1-blinded 
vial.  Depending on the treatment assignment, the vial configuration will be as follows: 

Investigational product Box configurations 

Dose 
Placebo 
60 mg 

Withdrawal 
Volume 

1.0 mL 
1.0 mL 

Configuration 
Placebo 
60 mg/mL AMG 162 

AMG 162 is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative free liquid in glass vials.  Formulation 
is 60 mg AMG 162 per mL of 10 mM Sodium Acetate, 5% Sorbitol in Water for Injection, 
and has a pH of 5.2.  Placebo will be presented in identical containers and the 
formulation will be identical to AMG 162 with the exception of the protein content.

Each box and the vial within the box will be labeled with a unique box number.  Upon the 
assignment of a box to a subject, the subject’s identification number and initials must be 
written on the box.   

Unique boxes will be assigned for each dose the subject will receive while on study.  To 
obtain box number assignment for a scheduled dose, site personnel should call the 
IVRS vendor.  The box number of investigational product is to be recorded on each 
subject’s Drug Administration case report form.

In addition, the subject’s identification number, initials, randomization identification 
number and box number must be written on all appropriate drug accountability and 
dispensing records.

Page 79 of 124
Page 79 of 108 

The identity of investigational product assigned to subject numbers or to individual boxes 
of investigational product will be contained in the IVRS.  Authorized site staff will be 
provided with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the IVRS to 
obtain unblinding information.  This PIN is unique to the individual and must not be 
shared.

A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject.  Unblinding at the study 
site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. 

The principal investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Study Manager
before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working 
day after the event and must document the unblinding in the subject’s case report form.   

Labeling 

Labeling will comply with US FDA and local regulatory requirements.

Storage 

AMG 162 and placebo will be stored at the investigational site at 2(cid:113) to 8°C.  Records of 
the actual storage conditions during the period of the study must be maintained, eg, 
records of the date, time and initials of person checking, and daily temperatures of the 
refrigerator used for storage of trial supplies, continuous temperature recordings or 
regularly maintained temperature alarm systems. 

Amgen Inc. or its designee must be notified if any test material is exposed to excessive 
or uncontrolled temperatures, in which case possible replacement of the material will be 
considered. 

Preparation 
Each box will contain one 1-mL vial.  A single 1.0 mL syringe should be used to prepare 
the dose.

There is no other special preparation required prior to investigational product 
administration.

Supply and Return of Drug 

At study initiation and as needed thereafter, investigational product will be shipped to a
responsible person (eg, a pharmacist) at the investigator’s institution, who will check the 
amount and condition of the drug and enter these data into the Proof of Receipt Form 
and Investigational Product Accountability Record.  At the end of the study, or as 
directed, all investigational product supplies will be returned to Amgen.   

Investigational Product Accountability 

An Investigational Product Accountability Record for the investigational products 
mandated by the protocol must be kept current and should contain: 

the dates and quantities of investigational product received from Amgen

(cid:120) 
(cid:120)  manufacturing batch or box numbers for product received
(cid:120)  subject’s identification (subject number and initials) 
(cid:120)  date and box number of investigational product dispensed  
(cid:120) 

the initials of the dispenser

The Return of Investigational Product for Destruction Form must be completed and 
included in the shipment of used and unused investigational product to Amgen or 
designee.  At the end of the study, the Final Investigational Product Reconciliation 
Statement must be completed and provided to Amgen. 

These inventories must be made available for inspection by an authorized Amgen 
representative or designee and regulatory agency inspectors.  The investigator is 
responsible for the accountability of all used and unused trial supplies. 

Calcium and Vitamin D Supplements 

Calcium and vitamin D supplements will not be provided directly by Amgen.  They 
should be obtained from suppliers approved by the pharmacy of the individual institution.  
These drugs will be formulated, packaged, labeled, and stored according to local 
manufacturer, supplier, and institutional procedures.  The investigator will be responsible 
for obtaining supplies of these drugs.

Appendix G.  Patient Reported Outcomes Assessment (PROA) 

During the course of the study, a patient reported outcomes assessment questionnaire 
that contains several previously validated scales and questions will be administered to 
assess patient pain, health related quality of life (HRQOL), psychological symptoms, and 
work and caregiver time: 

EQ-5D 

The EQ-5D, developed in 1990, is a widely used generic HRQOL instrument that allows 
for estimation of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY), a requirement for reimbursement 
dossiers and formulary submissions.  The EQ-5D is comprised of 6 questions evaluating 
the HRQOL domains of physical, mental and social functioning.  The first five questions 
recognize the following quality of life dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression.  Each of these questions has a simple three-
category response scale.  The last question is represented by a 20-cm vertical VAS, 
scored from 0 to 100 asking the patient to “mark your own health state today”.  These 
6 questions will take 2 minutes to complete (Brooks, 1996).  

EPIC-Hormonal 

The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument 
designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment.  The 
EPIC contains four scales that are calculated and reported separately:  Urinary, Bowel, 
Sexual and Hormonal Function.  Each scale also has one or more questions related to 
bother.  The EPIC Hormonal Scale consists of 5 questions about the frequency of hot 
flashes, breast tenderness, depression, lack of energy and weight change in the 
previous 4 weeks.  Bothersomeness is ranked for each of the five questions.   

The EPIC scales have been well validated in men with prostate cancer receiving 
prostatectomy, brachytherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy  
(Wei et al, 2000, 2002).   Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) for the EPIC 
Hormonal is 0.88, and test-retest reliability is 0.82.  The EPIC Hormonal scale is score 
from 0-100 where 100=optimal function or no bother.

Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 

Page 82 of 124
Page 82 of 108 

A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is an instrument that measures characteristics, such as 
pain, along a continuum of values.  These scales have been validated in numerous 
studies (Huskisson, 1983; Wewers, 1990).  These questions are rated from 0 to 10 
where 10 is pain as bad as can be imagined and 0 is equal to no pain.

Appendix H.  Informed Consent Form 

 

Protocol Number AMG 162 20040138 

A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate AMG 162 in 

the Treatment of Bone Loss in Subjects Undergoing Androgen-Deprivation 

Therapy for Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer  

This Addendum to the Informed Consent is in addition to the main consent that you have 
already signed for this study dated __________.  Please read this form and make sure 
that you receive satisfactory answers to any questions you might have before you decide 
to sign it 

1.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION 

a. 

What is this document?  

You are being invited to participate in a safety follow-up extension of the research study 
(also  known  as  a  clinical  trial)  that  you  are  currently  participating  in  for  a  drug  called 
AMG 162. 

This consent form is an addendum to the consent form that you have already signed.  It 
describes the nature of a safety follow-up extension phase for the study and to provide 
updated safety information for AMG 162.  If you agree to participate in the safety follow-
up phase, before signing this addendum, you should be sure that all your questions are 
answered and that you understand your rights as a study subject.  You will be given a 
signed copy of this form to keep. 

b. 

What is the safety follow up phase? 

The total duration the study you are currently participating in was a 36-month treatment 
phase.  The safety follow up phase has been added after the 36-month treatment phase 
to observe your progress after ending the 36-month treatment phase. 

c. 

How long is the safety follow up phase?  

The safety follow up phase will be for 24 months.

d. 

How often will I need to visit the hospital, clinic, or doctor’s office?  

During the safety follow up phase, safety data will be collected by clinic visit or telephone 
contact approximately every 6 months for up to 24 months after the Month 36 study visit. 

e. 

What will I be responsible for if I participate in the safety follow up phase? 

During  each  clinic  visit or  telephone  contact,  you  will  be  asked  about  the  medications 
you  have  taken  and  if  you  have  experienced  any  side  effects  or  developed  and  new 
medical problems since your last visit. 

You will be allowed to take any medication that your physician prescribes and you will be 
allowed to participate in other research studies.

Page 93 of 108 

f. 

What happens when the research study ends? 

Your involvement in the safety follow up phase of the study will be for a maximum of 
24 months.    However,  as  explained  in  the  main  consent  form  that  you  have  already 
signed, you may withdraw from this study any time you wish. 

2.  STUDY PROCEDURES 

What types of tests or procedures are involved with the safety follow up phase? 

The  end  of  study  visit  for  the  treatment  phase  of  the  study  is  scheduled  to  occur  at 
Month 36.  If you agree to participate in the safety follow up phase of the study, only 
safety information will be collected.  The safety information will be collected by clinic visit 
or  telephone  contact  approximately  every  6 months  for  up  to  24  months  after  the 
Month 36 visit. 

The test drug AMG 162 will not be given to you at any time in the safety follow up phase 
and you will not have any tests or imaging procedures. 

3.  SAFETY – POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 

In addition to the risks and discomforts explained in the informed consent form that you 
have already signed for the treatment phase of the study, you need to be aware of the 
following regarding subjects in other research studies with AMG 162: 

A short term decrease in blood calcium levels below normal has been observed in some 
subjects,  and  occasionally  has  been  associated  with  symptoms.    The  risk  of  this 
happening may be higher in subjects with abnormal kidney function who are not taking 
calcium or vitamin D supplements.  Symptoms of decreased blood levels of calcium may 
include a tingling sensation, muscle cramping or an abnormal heart rate.  Your physician 
may administer calcium intravenously to treat these symptoms.  During the study, if you 
experience any of these symptoms you should notify your doctor immediately.  Taking 
calcium and vitamin D supplements as directed by your physician may lower the risk that 
your calcium level will drop below normal. 

AMG 162 may have the potential to alter your immune system, which acts to protect you 
against infections.  AMG 162 does not appear to increase the occurrence of infection.  
However, in some studies, more patients receiving AMG 162 who developed infection 
were hospitalized. 

4.  CONFIDENTIALITY 

a. 

How will the confidentiality of my records be maintained? 

The confidentiality of your medical records will be maintained to the extent permitted by 
the  applicable  laws,  and  as  stated  in  the  main  consent  form  that  you  have  already 
signed  for  this  study.    If  results  of  the  trial  are  published,  your  identity  will  remain 
confidential.

A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate AMG 162 in 

the Treatment of Bone Loss in Subjects Undergoing Androgen-Deprivation 

Therapy for Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer

a. 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION 

What is this document?  

You are being invited to participate in a research study, also known as a clinical trial for 
a drug called AMG 162.  This drug is being evaluated in the treatment of bone loss 
caused by treatment for prostate cancer.   

This consent form will explain the experimental nature of this study, what it involves and 
the risks and benefits of receiving this experimental drug.  If you agree to participate in 
this research study, prior to signing this informed consent, you should be sure all your 
questions are answered and that you understand your rights as a study subject.  You will 
be given a signed copy of this form to keep. 

b. 

What is a research study?  

A research study asks unanswered questions about an investigational product and then 
answers those questions in a very scientific way by gathering information about how the 
drug works, its possible side effects, and the way that it is given to subjects.  

c. 

What is the purpose of this research study?  

Bone is constantly being broken down and built up throughout a person’s lifetime.  The 
entire skeleton is replaced about every seven to eight years.  The breaking down and 
building up of bone is called bone turnover.  If bone turnover is balanced (bone is being 
broken down at the same rate as bone is being built), then bone mass will remain about 
the same.  The higher the bone mass, the stronger the bone, and the less likely the bone 
will break when under stress. 

Osteoporosis is a disease of the bone that affects an estimated 75 million people 
worldwide and is characterized by a low bone mass.  The low bone mass is thought to 
be a result of the bone breaking down faster than it is being built.  Patients suffering from 
osteoporosis have an increased risk of breaking their bones, often the hipbone or 
vertebrae (backbones).  There are many causes of osteoporosis, the most common 
being due to the decrease in estrogen levels seen with the onset of menopause.   

Treatment of prostate cancer is initially targeted at removal of the tumor and preventing 
the spread of tumor cells.  The next common phase of treatment is called androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT), which is a type of hormone therapy where the body is 
deprived of androgen that feeds the prostate gland.  This ADT is also an important 
cause of osteoporosis.

Amgen Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Amgen”) has designed a novel protein, AMG 162, 
which has been shown in animal studies to regulate bone metabolism by inhibiting the 
cells that break down bone.  This results in a slower rate that bone is broken down and 
an increase in bone mass. 

Amgen is conducting a research study to evaluate the effect of AMG 162 on the 
occurrence of bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and fractures in men who have 
had prostate cancer.  The research study will also look at the effect of AMG 162 on bone 
mineral density of the proximal femur (upper part of the leg/hip), total body and distal 
radius (part of the arm).  

d. 

Who is funding this clinical study? 

Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”), a for-profit drug company, is funding this clinical study.  Amgen is 
the "sponsor" of the study, which means that Amgen designed the study and drafted the 
study plan. 

e. 

Why have I been asked to participate in this study? 

You have been asked to participate in this research study because your prostate cancer 
has been treated and you are currently undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.  Your 
doctor will ask you detailed questions about your past use of these types of drugs to 
determine your eligibility.  Additionally, you do not have any conditions that might affect 
bone metabolism (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Paget’s disease, etc). 

f. 

How many other people like me (subjects) will be participating in this 
study?  

About 1226 subjects from approximately 150 different centers in the North America, and 
Europe will be treated on this study.  

g. 

What kind of test drug will be tested in this study? 

The test drug that will be evaluated in this study is called AMG 162.  It is similar to an 
antibody that is found in your body and stops the cells that destroy bone.  If it is 
determined that you meet the entrance criteria, you will then be randomly assigned (like 
flipping a coin) to receive one of two treatment options:   

1.  60 mg AMG 162 injection one time every 6 months 

2.  Placebo injection one time every 6 months 

AMG 162 or placebo is given as one subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.  You will 
also be provided with calcium and vitamin D supplements which you should take on a 
daily basis. 

h. 

What are my chances that I will get the test drug? 

You will have a 1 in 2 chance of receiving study drug (AMG 162).

i. 

Will I know which treatment product I am receiving? 

No, this is a “double-blind” study, which means that neither you nor you doctor will know 
which drug you will receive.  In order to maintain a double blind, regardless of which 
treatment group you are assigned, you will receive an injection.  If you are assigned to 
receive the AMG 162 dose, then your injection will contain AMG 162.  If you are 
assigned to receive placebo, your injection will be a solution containing no drug. 

j. 

Who decides if I get the test drug product or something else? 

You will be randomized by chance to receive study drug or placebo.  Your doctor will not 
be able to choose which test drug you will receive.

k. 

How long is the study?  

The total treatment duration of the study is 36 months (3 years).  While enrolled in the 
study, you will receive study drug or placebo every 6 months through 30 months, you will 
be asked to return at 36 months for a final evaluation.

l. 

How often will I need to visit the hospital, clinic, or doctor’s office?  

There are 2 phases to the study: a screening phase to determine if you are eligible to 
participate in the study, and a 36-month treatment phase.  The screening phase should 
only take one or two visits (depending on scheduling within your clinic).  During the 
treatment phase, you will be asked to visit your doctor on study Day 1, one month after 
your first dose, then at 3, 6, 12, 15,18, 24, 30 and 36 months after your first dose.  

m.  What will I be responsible for if I participate in this study?  

You will be asked to take daily supplements of calcium and vitamin D, which will be 
supplied by your study doctor. 

During each clinic visit, you will be asked about the medications you have taken and if 
you have experienced any side effects or developed any new medical problems since 
your last visit.  If you have any fracture, you should contact your study doctor as soon as 
possible. 

You will be asked to complete a questionnaire (survey) every 6 months during the study 
and at the end of the study.  The questionnaire will take approximately 10 minutes to 
complete and asks about your health and well-being.  The purpose of this questionnaire 
is to gain information about the quality of life of people with bone loss due to prostate 
cancer treatment. 

While participating in the study, you will not be allowed to take certain medications.  
These include bisphosphonates (like pamidronate, zoledronate, alendronate or 
risedronate), corticosteroids, strontium, calcitonin, calcitriol, teriparatide or drugs known 
to have activity on bone metabolism (except calcium and vitamin D).  You will have to 
provide your study doctor or designee information about your medications.

n. 

What happens when the research study ends? 

Your involvement in the study will be for a maximum of 36 months.  However, you may 
withdraw from this study any time you wish.  You will not be asked to withdraw from the 
study if you develop a medical event related to your bones (ie, fracture or elevated blood 
calcium levels), unless you and your physician feel it would be appropriate for your 
specific medical condition.  Should you decide to withdraw before the end of the study 
your doctor may request that you come in for a complete physical exam, X-ray, and 
blood samples.  If at the end of the study you are experiencing any adverse experience 
related to the investigational product or have a lab abnormality felt by your doctor or 
Amgen to be clinically significant, you will be asked to come back for additional tests 
until the adverse experience or lab abnormality resolves. 

2. 

STUDY PROCEDURES 

What types of tests or procedures are involved with this study?  

Screening Phase

In order to determine whether you are eligible to participate in this study, you will be 
required to have what is called a “Screening” visit.  If you have signed the informed 
consent form, you will have the following procedures during this visit: 

(cid:131)  Your complete medical history will be taken, including disease and medication 

history. 

(cid:131)  You will have a physical examination (including vital signs). 

(cid:131)  You will have an X-ray of your spine. 

(cid:131)  You will have a DXA (bone density/body composition) scan of your spine, hip. 

(cid:131)  You will have a bone scan to ensure that you do not have bone metastasis 

(cancer that has spread to your bones). 

(cid:131)  You will have blood drawn for chemistry and hematology lab tests.  The total 

blood required will be about 12 mL (1 tablespoon). 

On-Study/Treatment Phase

If you qualify for the study and if you decide to participate, you will be randomized into 
one of two treatment groups:  

1.  placebo (a solution containing no active drug);  

2.  60 mg AMG 162  

This dose of study medication will be given by subcutaneous injection (under the skin) 
every six months.  

You will be provided calcium and vitamin D, both in the form of a tablet or capsule.  You 
will be required to take these on a daily basis for the duration of the study.

You will be required to visit your doctor periodically for study procedures and check-ups 
on Study Day 1 (Baseline visit), after 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months.  You will 
have assessments at each of these visits as outlined below. 

Exploratory Samples 

Exploratory sample collection is designed to develop blood laboratory test(s) that may 
help to identify patients who are most likely to be helped by AMG 162.  One of the goals 
of this study is to develop tests that will identify persons with cancer who will have the 
best possible response to AMG 162 and changes in metabolic growth factors. 

For these studies on Day 1, Month 1 and Month 12 about three teaspoonfuls of blood 
will be obtained prior to treatment with AMG 162 in an effort to determine if there are 
changes in how proteins are regulated in response to the drug. This is called proteomic 
analysis. 

These plasma and serum, samples may be stored for up to 5 years at an Amgen 
designated central laboratory.  All samples and information associated with the samples 
will be coded using labels with a unique code number to prevent the exposure of your 
information and identity (see Section 7 on Confidentiality for more details).  You will 
retain the right to have the exploratory sample material destroyed at any time by 
contacting the Principal Investigator.  

If a commercial product is developed from this research project, Amgen will own the 
commercial product and there are no plans for you to receive financial rewards or 
compensation for the commercial product, data, information, discoveries, or derivative 
materials gained or produced from the sample.  Amgen is responsible for the destruction 
of the exploratory sample(s) at your request or at the end of the storage period.  The 
Principal Investigator will provide Amgen with the required study and subject’s numbers, 
so that plasma and serum can be located and destroyed. 

Test drug administration 

You will receive a dose of study medication at the Day 1 visit and every 6 months 
through month 30.   

Tests and evaluations 

During the baseline visit and at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months you will have a 
physical examination, and a blood sample will be taken to evaluate your chemistry, 
hematology, testosterone and PSA levels.  Blood samples require approximately 
2 tablespoons.  

During every visit (baseline, months 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30 and 36) you will be asked 
about the medications you have taken and if you have experienced any side effects or 
developed any new medical conditions.  You will also be asked to complete a 
questionnaire asking about your quality of life and bone pain.  A blood sample will be 
taken to evaluate test drug (AMG 162) levels, and to see if you develop any antibodies 
(a protein made by the body to attack a foreign substance that the body thinks is 
harmful) to the test drug.

SAFETY – POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 

What are the general risks of participating in this research study?  

AMG 162 may cause all, some or none of the adverse events listed below.  Adverse 
events are undesirable medical conditions or a worsening of a pre-existing medical 
condition that may occur while you are enrolled in the study.  Rare or unforeseeable 
adverse events, which could be serious, may occur.  You will be monitored for any 
adverse occurrences.  If you experience any change in your medical condition or 
develop any symptoms associated with possible side effects described below during the 
study you should notify your doctor immediately. 

b. 

What are the known side effects of this test drug? 

AMG 162 

More than 4,000 subjects have been treated with AMG 162 in clinical studies.  AMG 162 
has been generally well tolerated. 

A transient decrease in blood calcium levels below normal has been observed in some 
subjects.  In rare cases, clinical symptoms of low calcium levels were observed.  
Symptoms of decreased calcium may include a tingling sensation, muscle cramping or 
an abnormal heart rate.  Your physician may administer calcium intravenously to treat 
these symptoms.  During the study, if you experience any of these symptoms possibly 
associated with low calcium, you should notify your doctor immediately.

In patients receiving AMG 162, the most frequent adverse events occurring very 
commonly (>=10%) in clinical trials included upper respiratory tract infection or 
inflammation (such as sore throat); nausea, headache, pain in joints, back and 
extremities, urinary tract infection, constipation, bone pain, weakness, fatigue, flu, high 
blood pressure, upset stomach, vomiting, rheumatoid arthritis (in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis only) and diarrhea.  

AMG 162 may have the potential to alter your immune system, which acts to protect you 
against infections.  In clinical trials to date, no evidence of immune system suppression 
has been observed. 

Development of antibodies to AMG 162 in patients has been uncommon.  Antibodies are 
proteins made by the body to attack a foreign substance that the body thinks are 
harmful.  If you develop antibodies to AMG 162, it is unknown whether these antibodies 
would affect you in any way.  To date, no clinical effects have been observed in patients 
who have developed antibodies to AMG 162.  These antibodies may or may not 
inactivate the action of AMG 162.  

In some patients receiving bisphosphonates for treatment of bone loss or cancer that 
involves the bone, a condition known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), may result.  
ONJ may be associated with pain and/or infection of the jaw bone, teeth or gums 
resulting in a non-healing area of exposed bone in the mouth.  How this happens is 
poorly understood.  Most patients have had tooth removal, gum surgery, dental implants 
or other invasive dental procedures before developing this condition.  AMG 162 works 
on the bone in a different way than bisphosphonates.  The potential risk of ONJ in 
patients receiving AMG 162 at this time remains unknown.  

As with any medication, you may experience an allergic reaction to the injection.  This 
may include mild reactions such as skin rash, but may also be severe, for example, 
causing a decrease in blood pressure or difficulty breathing.  If you experience any of 
these symptoms during the study, you should notify your doctor immediately.

The effect of AMG 162 on bone resorption appears fully reversible and discontinuing the 
drug can lead to reversal of the gains made in your bone density.  To ensure these 
losses in bone density are not excessive, if you discontinue AMG 162, you should be 
followed carefully.  Alternative approaches to maintaining prior gains should also be 
discussed with your physician.  

c. 

What procedures will be done in this research study?   

Injections:  

As with any injection, there may be some irritation at the injection site where the 
investigational product is administered.  Injection site adverse reactions have been 
observed commonly in subjects receiving AMG 162.  These could include bruising, pain, 
bleeding and rarely, infection at the injection site. 

Blood Draws: 

You will have your blood drawn periodically throughout the study.  Possible side effects 
of blood draws are pain, bruising, bleeding or infection at the site of the needle puncture.  
Blood draws may also cause temporary headache, nausea, and lightheadedness.

Spine X Ray: 

You will have x-rays taken of your spine.  You will be asked to lie down on an x-ray table 
or stand.  The radiology technologist will position you to obtain different x-ray views.  
You will be asked to hold your breath briefly when the x-rays are being taken.  The 
x-rays are used to identify any fractures, dislocations, thinning of the bone, or deformities 
in the curvature of the spine.  There is low radiation exposure for the x-ray series.  The 
amount or radiation received is approximately half of the annual naturally occurring 
background radiation from natural sources (sun, soil, food water) to which a person is 
exposed. 
DXA Scan: 

You will have DXA (Dual-Energy X-ray absorptiometry) scans to measure your bone 
density.  This will be done with a DXA scanner.  This scan involves lying on a table while 
the scan is being taken.  The DXA scan is painless and will take 10 to 30 minutes.  The 
amount of radiation received is approximately 1 – 2 days of naturally occurring 
background radiation from natural sources (sun, soil, food water) to which a person is 
exposed. 
DXA Scan – VFA: 

You will have a VFA scan.  This scan is obtained by using a DXA scanner and involves 
lying on a table while the scan is being taken.  This test is painless and will take 15 to 
40 minutes.  VFA is utilized to detect possible fractures in the spine.  The amount of 
radiation is approximately half the annual naturally occurring background radiation from 
natural sources (sun, soil, food water) to which a person is exposed. 

Calcium Supplements: 

The following side effects occur very rarely when calcium supplements are taken as 
recommended:  difficult or painful urination, unusually large amount of urine, or 
increased frequency of urination, nausea or vomiting (continuous), constipation (severe), 
loss of appetite, dryness of mouth, increased thirst, metallic taste, weakness or unusual 
tiredness, headache (continuing), irritability, drowsiness, depression, confusion, high 
blood pressure, increased sensitivity of eyes or skin to light and irregular, fast, or slow 
heartbeat.  
Check with your study doctor as soon as possible if any of these side effects occur. 
Vitamin D Supplements: 

Although these supplements do not usually cause side effects when taken as directed, 
you should notify your doctor immediately if you have any of the following possible side 
effects of vitamin D:  bone pain, muscle pain, nausea or vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, 
loss of appetite, metallic taste, dryness of mouth, weight loss, runny nose, increased 
thirst, increase in amount and frequency of urination, especially at night, cloudiness or 
protein in the urine, irregular heartbeat, itching skin, muscle pain, headache (continuing), 
drowsiness, unusual tiredness or weakness, calcium deposits (hard lumps) in tissues 
outside of the bone, itching of skin, loss of sex drive, mood or mental change, increased 
sensitivity of eyes to light or irritation of eyes, redness or discharge of the eye, eyelid, or 
lining of the eyelid, and runny nose. 

Check with your study doctor as soon as possible if any of these side effects occur.

Bone Scan: 

You will have a bone scan periodically throughout the study.  This procedure helps to 
determine if a cancer may have spread to the bone.  Bone scans may find cancer that 
has spread to the bone much earlier than regular x-rays.  The scan involves injecting a 
radioactive substance called a radionuclide into your vein.  This radionuclide travels 
through the blood and accumulates where the bone is breaking down or repairing itself.  

The radionuclide you will receive by injection is a substance that emits radiation.  The 
amount of radioactivity in the injection is very small, and virtually all activity is gone from 
the body within 2-3 days.  Allergic reactions to the radioactive tracer are rare.  As with 
any injection, there is a risk of bleeding and/or infection at the injection site.  After the 
injection, you will be asked to lie still on an x-ray table.  The actual scan takes about an 
hour.  The amount of radiation is approximately 18 months of the naturally occurring 
background radiation from natural sources (sun, soil, food water) to which a person is 
exposed. 

d. 

Can the side effects of this test drug or study specific procedures be 
harmful to my family, my offspring, or me? 

There is a chance that you may have side effects that have not been seen with the use 
of AMG 162.  There also may be risks that are unknown at the present time.  Your study 
physician will tell you if we learn anything that might affect your decision to continue with 
this study.  If significant new findings develop during the course of the study that might 
affect your willingness to continue to participate, they will be reported to you and/or your 
legally acceptable representative as soon as possible.  At the discretion of your 
physician and Amgen, you or your legally acceptable representative may be asked to 
sign a revised informed consent or consent addendum that provides this information.  If 
you have any worries or concerns about this study at any time you should contact 
(cid:31)(cid:31)Study Physician’s name at 24-hour phone number. (cid:33)(cid:33) 

e. 

What if my partner becomes pregnant during the study? 

It is not yet known whether AMG 162 causes any side effects in unborn children. 

If your partner is capable of becoming pregnant and you wish to participate in this study, 
you must use a medically acceptable method of birth control while taking part in this 
research study.  Because the risks of the experimental treatment to an unborn or 
newborn child are not known, your partner must not become pregnant during the study.  
If your partner becomes pregnant while you are participating in this study, you must 
notify the investigator immediately.  Amgen may request the investigator obtain 
additional information from you regarding the course of the pregnancy.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS 

What are the expected therapeutic benefits of this test drug? 

AMG 162 may potentially reduce the risk of injury (bone fractures) related to medically 
induced osteoporosis and possibly increase your bone density.  It is not expected that 
AMG 162 will have any direct effect on your cancer.  Whether or not it affects tumor 
growth positively or negatively is unknown.

b. 

Will I benefit from participating in this research study?  Will others? 

The main goal of this research study is to provide scientific information and it is not 
known whether you will receive any medical benefit.  It is possible that your bone density 
may increase, leading to a reduced risk for future bone fractures. 

5. 

a. 

ALTERNATIVE THERAPY 

If I choose not to participate in this study, are there other treatments or 
medications available to me, instead of this research drug? 

This is a research study and does not constitute treatment or therapy.  Alternative 
therapy is available for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis (for example, 
bisphosphonates, estrogen, and teriparatide).  You should discuss this with your doctor. 

b. 

Are there benefits with these other treatments?  Are there risks? 

The benefits of these other treatments are that they are proven to be effective in the 
treatment and/or prevention in people with osteoporosis.  There are risks associated with 
the use of each of them, including stomach/intestinal problems (bisphosphonates), and 
cancer risk (estrogens, HRT and teriparatide).

CONFIDENTIALITY 

How will the confidentiality of my records be maintained? 

The confidentiality of your medical records will be maintained to the extent permitted by 
the applicable laws.  If results of the trial are published, your identity will remain 
confidential. 

It is a requirement that your involvement in this study be noted in your medical records.  
Direct access to your records will be required by authorized representatives of Amgen to 
check the information collected for the study. 

All exploratory samples will be stored at an Amgen designated central laboratory.  All 
samples and information associated with the samples will be coded using labels with a 
unique code number to prevent the exposure of your information and identity.  This 
coding process allows Amgen to go back and destroy the samples at your request.  In 
addition, sample information is stored in one secured database while proteomic data is 
stored in an independent secured database. 

<<Where appropriate, use the country-specific statement.>> 

c. 

Who will have access to my medical information if I sign this informed 
consent form? 

It is a requirement that your involvement in this study be noted in your medical records.

Amendment 5 

Protocol Title:  A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate 

AMG 162 in the Treatment of Bone Loss in Subjects Undergoing Androgen-

Deprivation Therapy for Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer 

Amgen Protocol Number 20040138 

IND-11709 

EudraCT#: 2004-000512-17
19 February 2008 

Amendment Date: 
Rationale: 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are pre-specified and prioritized using a hierarchical 
order of hypothesis testing along with the Hochberg multiplicity adjustment procedure.  
While all secondary endpoints are maintained, the order of their testing is being changed 
to a new algorithm: all BMD-related endpoints will be tested first, followed by testing of 
the fracture-related endpoints.  Based on recently published information with 
antiresorptive therapy suggesting there is adequate power to detect a difference in 
subject incidence of new vertebral fracture at month 36, and recognizing that this 
endpoint is the preferred one for regulatory approval of anti-resorptive therapies, Amgen 
believes that the most appropriate testing strategy for fracture related endpoints is a 
combined testing of subject incidence of any fracture at 36 months together with subject 
incidence of new vertebral fracture at 36 months using the Hochberg procedure. 
In addition the following changes were made: 

1.  The efficacy subset for evaluating subject incidence of new vertebral fracture has 

been clarified to include all randomized subjects who have a baseline and  
(cid:149) 1 post-baseline evaluation of vertebral fracture at or prior to the time point 
under consideration.  The efficacy subset for evaluating any fracture has been 
updated to include all randomized subjects. 

2.  The definition of any fracture has been clarified to include any non-traumatic, 

non-metastatic fracture (excluding those at skull, facial, mandible, metacarpus, 
finger phalanges, and toe phalanges).  The definition of clinical fracture has been 
clarified to include non-vertebral and clinically evident non-traumatic, non-
metastatic fractures at cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae and lumbar 
vertebrae. 

3.  Analysis of any fracture has been updated to employ a logistic regression model 
(Agresti, 1990) with the treatment group and stratification factors as covariates if 
the absolute difference in the overall dropout rates between the treatment groups 
is < 3%.  Otherwise, analysis of any fracture will be based on the time to first any 
fracture using a Cox regression model (Lawless, 1982) with treatment group as 
the independent variable and stratified by the randomization stratification factors. 

4.  The overall survival analysis has been updated to include adjustments for 

baseline PSA risk level, prostate cancer recurrence risk and stratification factors 

5.  The adjudicated positive CV event analysis has been updated to include 

adjustment for baseline cardiovascular risk level 

6.  Other minor typographic and formatting errors have been made throughout

Section:    10.5.2.1  Efficacy Analysis 
 
Replace:
During the treatment phase of the study, any fracture incidence will be described 
as the proportion of subjects experiencing at least one vertebral or non-vertebral 
fracture (excluding skull, face, toes, and fingers) up to the time of analysis.  
Whether or not subjects experience fracture (Y/N) will be compared between treatment 
groups using logistic regression model (Agresti, 1990) with the treatment group and 
stratification factors, as covariates.  Incidence of all new vertebral fractures, and new or 
worsening vertebral fracture will be analyzed similarly.  The missing data will be imputed 
via LOCF in the primary analysis of any vertebral fracture.   The sensitivity analysis 
with respect to the imputation of missing data will be performed. 

With: 
Any fracture includes any non-traumatic1, non-metastatic fracture (excluding 
those at skull, facial, mandible, metacarpus, finger phalanges, and toe phalanges).  
Analysis of any fracture will employ a logistic regression model (Agresti, 1990) 
with the treatment group and stratification factors as covariates if the absolute 
difference in the overall dropout rates between the treatment groups is < 3%.  
Otherwise, analysis of any fracture will be based on the time to first any fracture 
using a Cox regression model (Lawless, 1982) with treatment group as the 
independent variable and stratified by the randomization stratification factors. 

Subject incidence of new vertebral fracture, and subject incidence of new or 
worsening vertebral fracture will be compared between the treatment groups using a 
logistic regression model with the treatment group and stratification factors as 
covariates.  The missing data will be imputed via LOCF in the primary analysis of 
vertebral fracture.  The sensitivity analysis with respect to the imputation of missing data 
will be performed.

Radiographs (or equivalent) of any non-vertebral fractures that occur will be obtained.  
For subjects who do not experience a non-vertebral fracture during the 36-month 
randomized treatment phase, their time to developing non-vertebral fracture will be 
censored at their last observation time on treatment phase of the study.  All non-
traumatic1, non-metastatic, non-vertebral fractures, except those of the skull, face, 
fingers, and toes, which are typically not associated with osteoporosis, will be included in 
this analysis.  Clinical fractures include all non-vertebral and clinically evident vertebral 
fractures.

Cardiovascular risk: 
The cardiovascular risk level is assessed by assigning a risk score based on 
criteria listed in Table 4, which is adapted from the Multiple Outcomes of 
Raloxifene (MORE) study (Keech et al, 2005).  Subjects with a cardiovascular risk 
assessment score (cid:149) 4 points will be considered at high risk for cardiovascular 
events, and subjects with < 4 points will be considered at low risk for 
cardiovascular events.

Subjects who had PSA > 0.5 ng/mL at baseline while on current ADT at baseline 
for > 1 month or had a PSA > 5.0 at baseline while on current ADT at baseline for  
(cid:148) 1 month are considered as having a high PSA level.  Otherwise, subjects are 
considered as having a low PSA level. 

Prostate Cancer Recurrence Risk 

The recurrence risk is defined as follows: 

(cid:120)  LOW: If primary tumor is T0 or T1 (including T1a-c), or T2a and regional 

lymph node is N0, and Gleason score 2 - 6; 

(cid:120)

regional lymph node is N0, and Gleason score is 7; or, if primary tumor is 
T2 or T2b- T2c and regional lymph node is N0, and Gleason score is 2 - 7; 

(cid:120)  HIGH: If primary tumor is T3 or T3a, and regional lymph node is N0 (any 

Gleason score); or if primary tumor is T1 (including T1a-c) - T2c and 
regional lymph node is N0 and Gleason score is 8 - 10;
