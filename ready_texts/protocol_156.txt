Study Design 

Denosumab will be non-inferior to intravenous (IV) zoledronic 
acid on time to first on-study SRE in subjects with advanced 
cancer with bone metastases (or lytic bone lesions from 
multiple myeloma).  It is anticipated that the true hazard ratio 
of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid is 0.9.   
Secondary Efficacy Hypotheses 
The following secondary efficacy hypotheses will be tested 
only if denosumab is found to be non-inferior to zoledronic 
acid with respect to time to first SRE.   

(cid:120)  denosumab is superior to zoledronic acid with 

respect to time to first on-study SRE  

(cid:120)  denosumab is superior to zoledronic acid with 

respect to time to first-and-subsequent on-study 
SRE (multiple event analysis)

This is an international phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 
active controlled study comparing denosumab with zoledronic 
acid in the treatment of bone metastases in subjects with 
advanced cancer or multiple myeloma.  Approximately 1690 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
denosumab, administered at a dose of 120 mg 
subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W), or zoledronic 
acid, administered IV at a dose of 4 mg (equivalent creatinine 
clearance-adjusted dose in subjects with baseline creatinine 
clearance (cid:100) 60 mL/min) as a single, minimum 15-minute 
infusion Q4W in a blinded manner.   
Randomization will be stratified by tumor type (non-small cell 
lung cancer or multiple myeloma or other), previous SRE (Yes 
or No), systemic anti-cancer therapy (eg, chemotherapy, 
biologic therapy or hormonal therapy; Yes or No) and region 
(Japan or other countries).  Within each stratum subjects will 
be randomized using an equal allocation ratio of 1:1.  
Stratification for tumor type will be bounded for this study 
limiting the enrollment to the non-small cell lung cancer 
stratum to 60% of the total study population and the multiple 
myeloma stratum to 10%. 
Each subject will receive either an SC injection of denosumab 
and an IV infusion of zoledronic acid placebo Q4W, or an SC 
injection of denosumab placebo and an IV infusion of 
zoledronic acid Q4W until approximately 745 subjects have 
experienced an on-study SRE and the primary efficacy and 
safety analysis is completed.   
An SRE is defined as pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-
vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of 
radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression.  
If denosumab is determined to have a positive benefit:risk 
profile compared with zoledronic acid, all subjects 
currently undergoing every 4 weeks scheduled 
assessments will be offered open-label denosumab at a 
dose of 120 mg SC until subjects have access to 
commercially available product or for up to 2 years, which 
ever comes first.  If the benefit:risk profile is not positive, 
all subjects will be followed for survival for 2 years after 
the last dose of blinded IP.

Serum denosumab concentration levels will be obtained from 
a subset of approximately 150 subjects at selected centers. 
It is strongly recommended that all subjects receive daily 
supplements of at least 500 mg calcium and at least 400 IU of 
vitamin D, unless documented hypercalcemia (albumin-
adjusted serum calcium > 2.9 mmol/L [11.5 mg/dL] or ionized 
calcium >1.5 mmol/L) develops on study.  Due to differences 
in regional availability, a dosage form of Vitamin D that gives 
an equivalent of at least 400 IU daily may be given.   
A data monitoring committee (DMC) will review safety and 
efficacy data at regular intervals during the blinded 
treatment phase.

Procedures 

Page 7 of 98 

Denosumab 120 mg SC or corresponding placebo will be 
administered Q4W. 
Zoledronic acid 4 mg (equivalent creatinine clearance-
adjusted dose in patients with baseline creatinine clearance (cid:100) 
60 mL/min) or corresponding placebo will be administered as 
an IV infusion over a minimum of 15 minutes Q4W. 
Administration of IV investigational product will be withheld 
(SC administration will continue) for any subject who 
experiences renal deterioration, defined (according to the 
Zometa(cid:147) prescribing information) as follows: 

(cid:120)  For subjects with normal baseline creatinine (< 1.4 

mg/dL; < 124 micromol/L), increase of (cid:116) 0.5 mg/dL; (cid:116) 
44 micromol/L 

(cid:120)  For subjects with abnormal baseline creatinine ((cid:116) 1.4 
mg/dL;(cid:116) 124 micromol/L), increase of (cid:116) 1.0 mg/dL; (cid:116) 
88 micromol/L.   

Re-exposure to IV investigational product may occur only if 
serum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline value.   
Additionally, administration of both (SC and IV) investigational 
products will be withheld for any subject who experiences a 
grade 3 or 4 adverse event (refer to Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 3.0) reported by 
the investigator as related to investigational product.  Re-
exposure to both investigational products may occur only 
when the event resolves to grade 1 or less and if the 
investigator and sponsor agree subject safety will not be 
compromised. 
If denosumab is determined to have a positive benefit:risk 
profile compared with zoledronic acid, all subjects 
currently undergoing every 4 weeks scheduled 
assessments will be offered open-label denosumab at a 
dose of 120 mg SC Q4W until subjects have access to 
commercially available product or for up to 2 years, which 
ever comes first.  If the benefit:risk profile is not positive, 
all subjects will be followed for survival for 2 years after 
the last dose of blinded IP. 
Zoledronic acid (Zometa(cid:147)) will be used as the control in this 
study. 
Blinded Treatment Phase 
Informed consent must be obtained before any study specific 
procedures are performed.  Assessments conducted as 
standard of care do not require informed consent and may be 
provided as screening data if conducted within 14 days before 
randomization (screening labs) or within 28 days before 
randomization (other procedures). 
Upon meeting all eligibility criteria and completing all 
screening assessments, subjects will be randomized within 8 
calendar days before the first administration of investigational 
product (study day 1).   
The following procedures will be performed at various visits

Statistical Considerations 

throughout the study:  medical, medication and cancer history; 
pregnancy test (women with reproductive potential); ECOG 
performance status; height (screening only); weight; vital 
signs; skeletal survey (x-rays); oral examinations; hematology; 
serum chemistry; serum for analysis of denosumab 
concentration levels; serum for anti-denosumab antibody 
assay; urine collection for urinary N-telopeptide assay; 
healthcare utilization and PRO assessments.   
Adverse events, skeletal related events, and concomitant 
medications will be recorded throughout the study. 
Subjects who withdraw early from administration of 
investigational product will continue on study, without 
investigational product administration. 
Open-label Treatment Phase 
Informed consent must be obtained before the open-label 
treatment phase may begin.   
The following procedures will be performed at various 
visits throughout the study:  ECOG performance status; 
oral examinations; serum chemistry; serum for 
anti-denosumab antibody assay; and BPI-SF.   
Adverse events, skeletal related events, and concomitant 
medications will be recorded throughout the study. 
Survival Follow-up 
For subjects ending study participation before the open-
label treatment phase, follow up survival data will be 
collected by clinic visit or telephone contact every 12 weeks 
for 2 years after the last dose of blinded investigational 
product. 
Statistical Analyses 
The principal analysis for the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints will employ the full analysis set (FAS) approach; the 
per-protocol approach will be considered supportive.  Time to 
first on-study SRE will be analyzed using a Cox model, with 
treatment groups as the independent variable and stratified by 
factors used to balance randomization.  A synthesis approach 
(Hung et al, 2003) will be used for the non-inferiority test for 
the primary endpoint.  The estimate of the effect of zoledronic 
acid effect relative to placebo will be based on the 3 historical 
studies and the 3-step approach, as described in 
Section 10.3.1.  In order to demonstrate 50% preservation of 
effect these historical data will be combined with the estimate 
of denosumab’s effect relative to zoledronic acid from this trial, 
to estimate denosumab’s effect relative to placebo.  If the 
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (two-sided) of the 
hazard ratio of denosumab to placebo is less than 1, then 
denosumab will be declared non-inferior to zoledronic acid, 
and we will proceed with a test for superiority; the results of 
the Cox model will be used directly to determine whether or 
not denosumab is superior to zoledronic acid.  For time to first-
and-subsequent on study SRE (multiple event analysis), the 
Prentice, Williams and Peterson (Prentice et al, 1981) 
approach will be used.

Subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events will 
be summarized for subjects who receive investigational 
products.  The incidence and percentages of subjects who 
develop anti-denosumab antibodies will be tabulated.  Overall 
survival will be summarized for all subjects enrolled by 
treatment group.   
Sample Size 
If the true hazard ratio is 0.9, 745 subjects with at least one 
SRE among the 1690 planned subjects provide 91% power to 
detect non-inferiority of denosumab to zoledronic acid, based 
on a synthesis approach (Hung et al, 2003), designed to 
demonstrate that denosumab preserves at least 50% of the 
effect of zoledronic acid.  Assuming a true hazard ratio of 0.8 
for both secondary endpoints and a correlation coefficient of 
0.6 between the two endpoints, this number of subjects with 
SRE will also provide 90% power to detect superiority of 
denosumab to zoledronic acid for at least one of the two 
secondary endpoints.  With 1690 subjects, an enrollment 
period of 23 months, and a loss to follow-up rate of 5% per 
year and death rate of 50% per year, the study is estimated to 
reach the primary analysis data cut-off in approximately 30 
months.  The median time to the first on-study SRE for the 
zoledronic acid treated subjects is expected to be 250 days.

To determine if denosumab is non-inferior to zoledronic acid (Zometa(cid:163)) with respect to 
the first on-study occurrence of a skeletal related event (SRE) in subjects with advanced 
cancer and bone metastases (or lytic bone lesions from multiple myeloma).  SRE is 
defined as pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone 
(including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

Disease  

Bone is the most frequent site for cancer metastases (Coleman, 1997) and bone 
metastases are a common reason for pain reported in cancer patients 
(Mercadante, 1997).  Bone metastases may also result in debilitating complications such 
as hypercalcemia or skeletal related events (SRE; Cook and Major, 2001), which include 
pathologic fractures, need for radiation therapy or surgery to bone, and spinal cord 
compression.   

d
e
v
o
r

p

The hallmark of bone metastases, irrespective of their gross radiographic appearance as 
osteoblastic or osteolytic, is increased osteoclastic activity (Roodman, 2004; 
Yonou et al, 2004). This activity can be demonstrated by both histological analyses of 
bone metastases as well as by increased levels of serum bone resorption markers 
(Demers et al, 2003).  

On a molecular level, receptor activation for nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)-RANK 
ligand (RANKL) system has been identified as an essential mediator of osteoclast 
formation, function and survival (Teitelbaum et al, 2003).  RANKL binds RANK on 
osteoclasts or osteoclast precursors to stimulate or promote differentiation into 
osteoclasts and activate mature osteoclasts to resorb bone.  This increased osteoclastic 
activity results in significant skeletal morbidity, ie SREs in patients with bone metastases 
(Hofbauer et al, 2001). 

Besides systemic antineoplastic treatment, radiation therapy to bone has been the 
mainstay of controlling metastatic bone disease.  Other widely used palliative treatments 
of metastatic bone disease include bisphosphonates, some of which have been shown 
to reduce the incidence of SREs, bone pain, and hypercalcemia in patients with bone 
metastasis in several randomized clinical trials (Saad et al, 2002; Rosen et al, 2001; 
Hortobagyi et al, 1996; Berenson et al, 1996).  Bisphosphonates can delay dissolution of 
calcium phosphate crystals in vitro, leading to initial investigation of their action on bone 
resorption in vivo.  While they have proven to be good inhibitors of bone resorption, it is 
now clear that their anti-resorptive activity resides in their ability to inhibit osteoclast 
activities, rather than their physicochemical properties (Fleisch, 1998).

Zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate that is administered intravenously every 3-4 weeks 
was chosen as the active comparator in this study because it has been shown to be 
effective in delaying the onset of SREs in subjects with advanced cancer and bone 
metastases as well as in patients with bone lesions from multiple myeloma.  Zoledronic 
acid is the only bisphosphonate that is globally approved for the treatment of bone 
lesions from advanced solid tumors and myeloma (Rosen et al, 2003a).  Pamidronate, 
another bisphosphonate that is administered intravenously, is approved for the treatment 
of bone metastases in breast cancer or myeloma.  Zoledronic acid was non-inferior to 
pamidronate in myeloma (Rosen et al, 2001).

Denosumab Background  

Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity (Kd 3 x 10-12 M) 
and specificity for RANKL that can bind and neutralize the activity of human RANKL 
similar to the action of native osteoprotegerin (OPG) and its engineered variants.  
Denosumab inhibits RANKL, the essential mediator of osteoclast formation, function, 
and survival.  Denosumab does not cross-react with other factors of the TNF family such 
as tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF(cid:68)), TNF(cid:69), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand 
(TRAIL), or CD40 ligand (CD40L). 

2.2.1 

Clinical Experience With Denosumab 

A comprehensive clinical program to evaluate denosumab in the treatment and 
prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, the treatment of bone loss associated with 
hormone ablative therapy in subjects with cancer, the treatment of cancer-associated 
bone disease, and the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is currently underway.  Three 
phase 1 clinical studies evaluating denosumab have been completed (Studies 
20010123, 20010124, and 20030148), and data from the first 24 months from an 
ongoing phase 2 dose-finding study in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral 
density (BMD) are available (Study 20010223).  Single doses of up to 3 mg/kg SC or IV 
(weight-based) have been studied.  In addition, repeated doses of up to 210 mg SC 
every 6 months (fixed dose) are being studied for up to 12 months.  Subjects 
participating in denosumab clinical studies also received supplemental calcium and 
vitamin D in addition to the investigational product. 

Additional information can be found in the denosumab investigators brochure.

2.2.1.1  Efficacy 

Page 21 of 98 

A single SC or IV dose of denosumab was effective in reducing markers of bone 
turnover (eg, urinary N-telopeptide (NTX)/creatinine) in a dose-dependent manner.  The 
effect was observed at the earliest time point tested, 12 hours after administration.  
Across the range of doses, the maximum mean decrease in urine NTX/creatinine was 
approximately 80%, and the duration of effect was at least 6 months at doses of 1 and 
3 mg/kg denosumab in healthy postmenopausal women (Study 20010124) and 
3 months in most subjects with multiple myeloma or breast cancer with bone metastases 
(Study 20010123).

A 3-month interim analysis was conducted on a phase 2 study (20040113) evaluating 
five different doses and schedules of SC denosumab (ie, 30 mg, 120 mg, and 180 mg 
every 4 weeks; 60 mg and 180 mg every 12 weeks) versus IV bisphosphonates in 
255 subjects with breast cancer and bone metastases.  All five denosumab arms 
showed marked biological activity in reducing bone resorption, which was comparable to 
that seen with bisphosphonates.  The rate of skeletal related events in the denosumab 
arms was similar to that observed in the bisphosphonate arm. 

2.2.1.2  Safety 

Denosumab has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies conducted to date.  The 
most common adverse events reported in the clinical studies completed to date were 
headache, back pain, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, and nasopharyngitis.   

Data obtained from 2 studies of denosumab (Studies 20010223 and 20040148) suggest 
that any hypocalcemia observed following administration of denosumab is transient, 
mild, and generally occurs within the first 2 weeks.  Three subjects in Study 20030148 
and 1 subject in Study 20010223 had transient decreases in albumin-adjusted serum 
calcium concentrations < 2 mmol/L during the study without clinical sequelae.  One 
subject in Study 20040138 (a phase 3 study in subjects undergoing 
androgen-deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer), who received 60 mg 
SC denosumab every 6 months, experienced a serious adverse event of hypocalcemia 
and tetany, which resolved with calcium treatment.  Analysis of the safety data from the 
interim analysis of 20040113 indicates that no symptomatic hypocalcemia was 
observed; one asymptomatic grade 3 hypocalcemia was observed in the highest dose 
group (denosumab 180 mg q 4 wk; n = 43).  No grade 2 or grade 3 hypocalcemia was

Page 22 of 98 

observed in the group receiving denosumab 120 mg q 4 wk (n = 41), the dose and 
schedule selected for protocol 20050244. 

In two ongoing phase 2 studies (Studies 20040113 and 20040114) in subjects with 
advanced cancer and bone metastases, multiple fixed doses of 60 to 180 mg q12 wk or 
30 to 180 mg q 4 wk are being tested, with no significant related serious adverse events 
as of 10 June 2005.  The unrelated serious adverse events observed on these studies 
are consistent with those expected for patients with advanced cancer being treated with 
myelosuppressive therapy and include dysphagia, vomiting, peripheral edema, 
neutropenia, anemia, fever, peripheral neuropathy, infections, bone pain, fracture, 
pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, stroke, bradycardia, disease progression, and 
death.  In all doses/schedules tested, denosumab was found to be safe and well 
tolerated. No clinically significant changes were observed in electrocardiogram results or 
in vital signs.  No SAE or deaths were considered related to denosumab. 

A subject receiving denosumab on protocol 20040113 (blinded dose and schedule) who 
had been diagnosed with progressive underlying breast cancer 2 days after 
investigational product administration, died as a result of metastatic neoplasm 5 weeks 
after investigational product administration; this death was deemed unrelated to 
investigational product.   

Two subjects developed a transient anti-denosumab binding antibody response in phase 
2 Study 20010223.  However, the subjects’ serum had no neutralizing activity in a 
bioassay testing for inhibitory activity.  In phase 1 Study 20030148, 2 subjects who 
received denosumab tested positive for binding antibodies to denosumab at one time 
point each during the study.  Two additional subjects (1 denosumab, 1 placebo) tested 
positive for binding antibodies to denosumab before receiving investigational product.  
However, the results of bioassay testing for inhibitory or neutralizing antibody effects 
were negative.  No evidence of an effect of the binding antibodies on pharmacokinetics 
or bone turnover markers was observed in these subjects.

In Japan, a phase 1 study in Japanese subjects with breast cancer related bone 
metastasis, Study 20040176, has been conducted to characterize the safety profile of 
Japanese subjects receiving 60 or 180 mg fixed dose SC administration of denosumab 
single dose or 180 mg fixed dose q 4 weeks.  Data are not yet available.

2.2.1.3  Pharmacokinetics 

Page 23 of 98 

After multiple fixed doses of 6 to 30 mg every 3 months or 14 to 210 mg every 6 months 
in postmenopausal women with low BMD, denosumab did not accumulate appreciably at 
any of the doses or dosing frequencies investigated.  In addition, the pharmacokinetics 
did not appear to be altered upon multiple dosing. 

Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the interim analysis of 20040113 indicate an 
approximate 2.5-fold accumulation observed by the third dose of denosumab 30, 120, or 
180 mg given on an every 4-week schedule.  This is consistent with the extent predicted 
based on PK modeling and simulation of the combined phase 1 (single dose) and phase 
2 PK data, indicating that denosumab pharmacokinetics do not change upon multiple 
dosing in breast cancer patients.  This further suggests that the extent of accumulation 
at steady-state will be as predicted for the proposed dose regimen and will result in 
attainment of target serum concentrations. 

2.3 

Rationale  

Bone complications associated with cancer arise from increased bone resorption and 
include bone pain, pathologic bone fractures, nerve compression, and hypercalcemia.  
Accumulating evidence suggests that most pathologic bone resorption relies on the 
RANK/RANKL pathway, which regulates the formation, function and survival of 
osteoclasts (Bolon et al, 2002; Roodman, 2001). Another key component of the 
RANK/RANKL pathway is osteoprotegerin (OPG), an endogenous decoy receptor that 
binds and neutralizes RANKL.  The antiresorptive property of OPG has been 
demonstrated in murine models of hypercalcemia of malignancy (Dunstan et al, 1997) 
and metastatic bone destruction (data on file).  According to recent findings, it appears 
that maximum anti-resorptive effects due to RANKL-RANK pathway inhibition are more 
pronounced than those due to bisphosphonates (Morony et al, 2005).   

2.3.1 

Denosumab Dose Selection  

The selection of the dose and schedule was based on safety, pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic data obtained from phase 1 and 2 studies.  Specifically, study 
20040113 testing 5 different doses and schedules of SC denosumab vs. IV 
bisphosphonates in 255 patients with breast cancer and bone metastases provided a 
comprehensive dataset guiding the dose selection for patients with bone metastases.  
All 5 denosumab arms showed marked biological activity in reducing bone resorption

comparable to that seen with bisphosphonates.  The rate of skeletal related events in the 
denosumab arms similar to that observed in the bisphosphonate arm.  Of the 
denosumab doses and schedules tested, the regimen of 120 mg Q4W was associated 
with maximum reduction of the bone turnover marker uNTX by week 13, the primary 
endpoint of that study. 

The 120 mg Q4W schedule avoided low exposures (eg, serum levels below 
4000 ng/mL) that could potentially translate into reduced efficacy in some patients based 
on preliminary population PK/PD modeling of the phase 2 data.  Denosumab was found 
to be safe and well tolerated in all study arms.  While no symptomatic hypocalcemia was 
recorded in study 20040113, the 120 mg Q4W schedule (n = 41) appeared preferable 
because no grade 2 or higher hypocalcemia was recorded as opposed to five grade 2 
and one grade 3 hypocalcemia events in the denosumab 180 mg Q4W group (n = 43).  
Based on the favorable efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profile of that regimen, the 
120 mg Q4W schedule was selected for the phase 3 studies in subjects with bone 
metastases, including study 20050244. 

2.3.2 

Selection of Comparator 

The bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (Zometa(cid:147)), was chosen as the comparator in this 
study as this agent is a widely approved treatment for the delay of skeletal-related 
events arising from bone metastases in patients with advanced cancer (or lytic bone 
lesions from multiple myeloma).   

Compared with IV bisphosphonates denosumab represents a new and potentially 
efficacious and convenient treatment for pathologic bone conditions characterized by 
increased bone resorption. 

2.4 

2.4.1 

Hypotheses 

Primary Hypothesis 

Denosumab will be non-inferior to intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid on time to first 
on-study SRE in subjects with advanced cancer with bone metastases (or lytic bone 
lesions from multiple myeloma).  It is anticipated that the true hazard ratio of denosumab 
compared with zoledronic acid is 0.9.

Secondary Efficacy Hypotheses 

Page 25 of 98 

The following secondary efficacy hypotheses will be tested only if denosumab is found to 
be non-inferior to zoledronic acid with respect to time to first SRE.  

(cid:120)  denosumab is superior to zoledronic acid with respect to time to first on-study SRE  
(cid:120)  denosumab is superior to zoledronic acid with respect to time to first-and-subsequent 

on-study SRE (multiple event analysis)

EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 

Study Design 

3.1 
This is an international, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active controlled study 
comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid in the treatment of bone metastases in 
subjects with advanced cancer or multiple myeloma.  Approximately 1690 subjects will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either denosumab, administered at a dose of 
120 mg SC every 4 weeks (Q4W), or zoledronic acid, administered IV at a dose of 4 mg 
(equivalent creatinine clearance-adjusted dose in subjects with baseline creatinine 
clearance (cid:100) 60 mL/min) as a single, minimum 15-minute infusion Q4W, in a blinded 
manner. 

Randomization will be stratified by tumor type (non-small cell lung cancer or multiple 
myeloma or other), previous SRE (Yes or No), systemic anti-cancer therapy 
(eg, chemotherapy, biologic therapy or hormonal therapy; Yes or No) and region (Japan 
or other countries (this is planned to be a global study. However, if Japan is not one of 
the participating countries then stratification by region will not be necessary)).  Within 
each stratum subjects will be randomized using an equal allocation ratio of 1:1.  
Stratification for tumor type will be bounded for this study limiting the enrollment to the 
non-small cell lung cancer stratum to 60% of the total study population and the multiple 
myeloma stratum to 10%.

Each subject will receive either an SC injection of denosumab and an IV infusion of 
zoledronic acid placebo Q4W, or an SC injection of denosumab placebo and an IV 
infusion of zoledronic acid Q4W until approximately 745 subjects have experienced at 
least one on-study SRE and the primary efficacy and safety analysis is completed.   

Serum denosumab concentration levels will be obtained from a subset of approximately 
150 subjects prior to administration of the investigational products on study day 1, then 
on weeks 5, 9, 13, 25, 49, 73, 97 and at the end of study visit.  The centers that will

Page 26 of 98 

participate in this part of the study will be determined at the time of site selection on the 
basis of site interest, site ability to obtain and process serum denosumab concentration 
samples, and recruitment capacity. 

If denosumab is determined to have a positive benefit:risk profile compared with 
zoledronic acid, all subjects currently undergoing every 4 weeks scheduled 
assessments will be offered open-label denosumab at a dose of 120 mg SC until 
subjects have access to commercially available product or for up to 2 years, 
which ever comes first.  If the benefit:risk profile is not positive, all subjects will 
be followed for survival for 2 years after the last dose of blinded IP. 

It is strongly recommended that all subjects receive daily supplements of at least 500 mg 
calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D, unless documented hypercalcemia 
(albumin-adjusted serum calcium > 2.9 mmol/L [11.5 mg/dL] or ionized calcium 
>1.5 mmol/L) develops on study.  Due to differences in regional availability, a dosage 
form of Vitamin D that gives an equivalent of at least 400 IU daily may be given.   

A data monitoring committee (DMC) will review safety and efficacy data at regular 
intervals during the blinded treatment phase. 

A study schema at the end of the protocol synopsis section describes the overall study 
design. 

The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.2. 

3.2 

Number of Centers 

Approximately 400 investigative sites will participate in this study worldwide.  Sites that 
do not enroll at least 1 subject within 6 months of site initiation may be closed to further 
participation. 

3.3 

Number of Subjects 

Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”. 

Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment 
groups.  Approximately 845 subjects will be randomized to each treatment group, for a 
total planned sample size of approximately 1690 subjects.  An anticipated 5% per year

loss to follow-up rate and an anticipated 50% per year death rate have been accounted 
for.   

Refer to Section 10.3 for details on the rationale for the number of subjects. 

3.4 

Estimated Study Duration 

The anticipated total duration of the blinded treatment phase will be approximately 
34 months from first subject enrolled.  This represents subject recruitment, time 
for approximately 745 subjects to experience at least one on-study SRE, and 
continued blinded treatment until the primary analysis is complete and the 
benefit:risk profile of denosumab is determined.  Actual study duration may be 
longer or shorter, depending on the time it takes for approximately 745 subjects to 
experience at least one on-study SRE. 

Following the blinded treatment phase, if positive benefit: risk is determined then 
all subjects continuing with every 4 weeks scheduled assessments will be offered 
open-label denosumab.  Otherwise, subjects will be followed for survival for up to 
2 years (24 months). 

3.4.1 

Study Duration for Participants 

The estimated range of time on the blinded treatment phase for an individual 
participant is 11 to 34 months, based on actual enrollment and observed attrition.  
The open-label or survival follow-up phase will be up to 2 years.  The maximum 
study participation for an individual subject will be approximately 58 months.  
Actual study duration for individual participants may be longer or shorter, 
depending on the time it takes for approximately 745 subjects to experience at 
least one on-study SRE.

3.4.2 

End of Study 

If the benefit:risk is positive, the end of study is defined as 4 weeks after the last 
dose of denosumab in the open label treatment phase.  If the benefit:risk is not 
positive, the end of study is defined as 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational 
product in the end of the blinded treatment phase.  

Amgen will set a primary analysis data cut-off date for the primary analysis in 
anticipation of 745 subjects having experienced an on-study SRE.  End of study visits 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 28 of 98 

will occur during a 4-week window following the termination date.  Hence, the analysis 
will be based on the data from randomization through the primary analysis data cut-off 
date. 

There have been improvements in the delivery and types of systemic therapy for 
metastatic cancer that may cause the median time-to-first-SRE to extend beyond that 
seen in previous studies with IV bisphosphonates.  Because of this and because prior 
use of oral bisphosphonate (for osteoporosis) is allowed in this study, it may take longer 
than the proposed 30 months (from the 1st subject enrolled) to observe 745 subjects 
experiencing a first on-study SRE, which may delay the overall time required to reach 
the primary analysis data cut-off date.   

Amgen will monitor the overall SRE rate pooled by treatment group; if it is lower than 
expected, Amgen may choose to modify the sample size in order to prevent a lengthy 
extension to the duration of the study. 

4. 

SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY 

Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidates’ age, race, 
date of screening, and the outcome of the screening process (eg, enrolled into study, 
reason for ineligibility, or declined to participate).

5. 

SUBJECT ENROLLMENT 

Before subjects may be entered into the study, Amgen Inc requires a copy of the site’s 
written Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) approval of 
the protocol, informed consent form, and all other subject information and/or recruitment 
material, if applicable (see Section 12.3).  All subjects or legally acceptable 
representatives must personally sign and date the consent form before any 
study-specific screening procedures.   

5.1 

Screening 

Screening assessments conducted as standard of care do not require informed consent 
and may be provided as screening data if conducted within the following timelines: 

d
e
v
o
r
p
p

(cid:120)  negative pregnancy test, where applicable, result no more than 7 days before 

randomization 

(cid:120)  screening labs no more than 14 days before randomization 
(cid:120)  other procedures no more than 28 days before randomization 

All subjects who enter into the screening period for the study will receive a unique 
subject identification number before any study procedures are performed.  This number 
will be used to identify the subject throughout the trial and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject.  The subject identification number must remain 
constant throughout the entire trial; it must not be changed at the time of re-screening, 
enrollment, or randomization.  This number will not be the same as the randomization 
number assigned for the study.   

The subject identification number will consist of 9 digits.  The first 3 digits will represent a 
protocol identifier (ie, 244) and will be identical for all sites.  The next 3 digits will 
represent the site number (ie, 101, 102, 103) and will be identical for all subjects at a 
particular site.  The last 3 digits will represent the subject identification and will be 
assigned in sequential order, per site, as subjects are screened (ie, 001, 002, 003).  
Therefore, the first subject to enter screening at site 101 will receive the number 
244101001; the second subject at this site will receive the number 244101002, etc.

Refer to Section 7 and Appendix A for screening procedures and medical history details.  
Subjects may be re-screened once.  If a subject fails to meet all entry criteria after 2 
attempts, the subject may not be enrolled into the study. 

The enrollment date is defined as the date the subject is randomized (ie, the date the 
interactive voice response system [IVRS] is used to confirm eligibility and complete the 
randomization process). 

5.2 

Treatment Assignment 

A subject who gives written informed consent and who satisfies all the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria may be randomized into the study.  Questions about subject eligibility 
should be discussed (and documented) with Amgen Inc or designee before 
randomization.  Once the site deems a subject eligible for the study, an eligibility 
worksheet must be completed by the site and faxed to the sponsor or designee for 
review and confirmation. 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 32 of 98 

Upon confirmation of eligibility, the site will telephone IVRS in order to randomize the 
subject centrally to receive either SC injection of denosumab (and IV infusion of 
zoledronic acid-matched placebo) or IV infusion of zoledronic acid (and SC injection of 
denosumab-matched placebo).  

The IVRS will provide the caller with box numbers for each investigational product and a 
subject randomization number that will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).  
Treatment assignment will be notified by telephone with the central randomization center 
and confirmed by fax. 

5.3 

Randomization 

Randomization will be stratified by tumor type (non-small cell lung cancer or multiple 
myeloma or other), previous SRE (Yes or No), systemic anti-cancer therapy 
(eg, chemotherapy, biologic therapy or hormonal therapy; Yes or No) and region (Japan 
or other countries).   

A subject will be assigned by an IVRS to one of 2 treatment groups (denosumab or 
zoledronic acid), in a 1:1 ratio, with the assignment balanced with respect to stratification 
factors at the time of study entry.  The randomization list will be generated and 
maintained by an Amgen Inc representative not involved in the conduct of the study.

The subject, center personnel and all Amgen study personnel and designees involved 
with the conduct of the study, will remain blinded to the randomized treatment 
assignment for investigational product, with the following exceptions: 

(cid:120) 

(cid:120) 

for analysis of the denosumab concentration levels and anti-denosumab antibody 
samples.  Serum samples from those subjects who received denosumab and IV 
zoledronic acid placebo will be identified by select unblinded Amgen individuals who 
will be directly involved with the analysis of those samples (ie, Amgen’s Biological 
Sample Management group and Amgen’s Clinical Immunology laboratory) 
for those circumstances where the investigator deems it necessary to break the blind 
in order to provide appropriate medical treatment for the subject.  Refer to 
Section 10.4 for details on when and how the randomization code may be broken

6. 

TREATMENT PROCEDURES 

Denosumab and zoledronic acid will be considered the only investigational products in 
this study, however matching placebo will be administered at an equivalent volume to 
maintain the double-blind nature of the study.  In addition, subjects are strongly 
recommended to receive calcium and vitamin D and these medications will be referred 
to as supplements. 

6.1 

6.1.1 

Blinded Treatment Phase 

Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 

Denosumab is administered by SC injection and zoledronic acid is administered by IV 
infusion, therefore the investigational products will be administered in a double-blind 
manner, Q4W.  There must be at least a 3-week interval between administrations of 
investigational products.      

Each subject will receive either  

(cid:120)  an SC injection of denosumab and an IV infusion of zoledronic acid placebo (diluted 

in either 0.9% Sodium Chloride, United States Pharmacopoeia [USP] or 5% 
Dextrose Injection, USP) Q4W;  

OR

(cid:120)  an SC injection of denosumab placebo and an IV infusion of zoledronic acid (diluted 

in either 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP) Q4W. 

The SC injection must be administered first, followed by the IV solution administered as 
a single IV infusion over a minimum of 15 minutes. All investigational products must be 
administered by a licensed health care professional.   

The investigational products will be administered as follows: 

(cid:120)  Denosumab 120 mg/matching placebo will be administered SC injection Q4W 
(cid:120)  Zoledronic acid 4 mg (equivalent clearance-adjusted dose in subjects with baseline 

creatinine clearance (cid:100) 60 ml/min) / matching placebo will be administered as a 
minimum 15-minute, IV infusion Q4W 

Refer to the pharmacy guide (Appendix B) for information on the administration of 
denosumab.

Zoledronic acid (Zometa(cid:147)) is the blinded, active comparator used in this study, supplied 
as a concentrate for intravenous infusion.  For additional information, refer to the 
Zometa(cid:147) prescribing information. 

6.1.2 

Missed Dose 

If any scheduled dose after study day 1 is delayed for more than 8 calendar days from 
the scheduled visit date, this will be considered a missed dose and recorded as such on 
the CRF.  The next dose is to be given on the next scheduled visit date (based on study 
day 1).   

6.1.3 

Dose Escalation and Stopping Rules 

There are no planned dose escalations in this study. 

Administration of IV investigational product will be withheld (SC administration will 
continue) for any subject who experiences renal deterioration, defined (according to the 
Zometa(cid:147) prescribing information) as follows: 

(cid:120)  For subjects with normal baseline creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dL; < 124 micromol/L), 

increase of (cid:116) 0.5 mg/dL; (cid:116) 44 micromol/L 

(cid:120)  For subjects with abnormal baseline creatinine ((cid:116) 1.4 mg/dL; (cid:116) 124 micromol/L), 

increase of (cid:116) 1.0 mg/dL; (cid:116) 88 micromol/L 

Re-exposure to IV investigational product may occur only if serum creatinine returns to 
within 10% of the baseline value.  The IV investigational product should be re-initiated at 
the same dose as that prior to treatment interruption. 

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

Additionally, administration of both (SC and IV) investigational products will be withheld 
for any subject who experiences a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (refer to CTCAE Version 
3.0) reported by the investigator as related to investigational product.  Re-exposure to 
both investigational products may occur only when the event resolves to grade 1 or less 
and if the investigator and sponsor agree subject safety will not be compromised. 

A schema in the protocol synopsis describes the dosing schedule. 

6.1.4 

Dosage Adjustments 

There will be no dose adjustments for the SC investigational product. 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 35 of 98 

The dose of the IV investigational product will be determined based on the subject’s 
baseline creatinine clearance (measured locally, within 14 days before investigational 
product dosing) as specified in Table 1.

aThis dose of investigational product will be maintained throughout study. 

Cockcroft-Gault formula 

To calculate the subject’s creatinine clearance (CrCl), use the following Cockcroft-Gault 
formula, as provided in the Zometa(cid:147) prescribing information: 

              CrCl  =     (140 - age [in years]) x weight (kg)     (x  0.85 for females) 
                                 (72 x serum creatinine [mg/dL]) 

If the serum creatinine is obtained using the International System of Units (SI) (ie, 
micromol/L), use the following formula to convert SI units to conventional (mg/dL) units 
(Manual of Laboratory & Diagnostic Tests, 2004): 

serum creatinine (micromol/L) divided by 88.4 = serum creatinine (mg/dL)

Throughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in Section 6.1.7.  All concomitant medications, including over-the-counter products, 
administered while the subject is enrolled in the study must be recorded on the CRF.   
Additional instructions may be found in the protocol study guide. 

Usual therapy for metastatic cancer is allowed during study treatment. 

6.1.6 

Supplements 

It is strongly recommended that all subjects receive daily supplements of at least 500 mg 
calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D, unless documented hypercalcemia 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab

(albumin-adjusted serum calcium > 2.9 mmol/L [11.5 mg/dL] or ionized calcium 
>1.5 mmol/L) develops on study.  Due to differences in regional availability, a dosage 
form of Vitamin D that gives an equivalent of at least 400 IU daily may be given.   

Supplements will be recorded as concomitant medication on the CRF.  Refer to the 
protocol Study Guide for specific instructions for recording this information. 

6.1.7 

Proscribed Medication and Therapy During Study Period 

Bisphosphonates (oral or IV, except the IV investigational product) are not to be 
administered during the study treatment.  Subjects taking oral bisphosphonates for 
osteoporosis must stop taking the medication before study day 1 and may not resume 
oral bisphosphonates until after all end of study assessments are completed. 

Use of any unapproved (ie, no marketing authorization has been granted) investigational 
product (other than denosumab) or device is not allowed until after all end of study 
assessments are completed. 

Subjects who receive oral or IV bisphosphonates (other than the IV investigational 
product) or any unapproved investigational product(s) or device(s) during the study must 
be discontinued from further administration of investigational products but will continue 
with all other study assessments Q4W, without further investigational product 
administration, as per the schedule of assessments.

Invasive dental procedures should be avoided, if possible, as per Zometa® prescribing 
information.  If a subject undergoes an invasive dental procedure while on study, a 
clinical decision to continue the subject on study must be documented in the medical 
chart. 

6.2 

Open-Label Treatment Phase 

If denosumab is determined to have a positive benefit:risk profile compared with 
zoledronic acid, all subjects currently undergoing every 4 weeks scheduled 
assessments will be offered open-label denosumab at a dose of 120 mg SC until 
subjects have access to commercially available product or for up to 2 years, 
which ever comes first. 

6.2.1 

Investigational Product Dosage, Administration and Schedule

Proscribed Medication and Therapy During Study Period 

Bisphosphonates (oral or IV, except the IV investigational product) are not to be 
administered during the open-label treatment phase. 

7. 

STUDY PROCEDURES 

Study assessments will be performed only after written informed consent is obtained.  
The schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix A.  Study visits during the blinded 
and open-label treatment phases will occur every 4 weeks.  Every effort should be 
made to keep subjects on the study schedule as planned from study day 1.   

For subjects ending study participation before the open-label treatment phase, 
follow up survival data will be collected by clinic visit or telephone contact every 12 
weeks for 2 years after the last dose of blinded investigational product.  

All study assessments must be completed before investigational product administration. 

Post-baseline study visits may be conducted (cid:114) 8 days from the scheduled visit date 
(based on study day 1), if necessary.  The following visit should return the subject to the 
original planned schedule.

Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 38 of 98 

Any missed visits, tests not done, or examinations that are not conducted must be 
reported as such on the CRF.   

All central laboratory values will be electronically transferred from the laboratory to the 
Amgen clinical database.  Specific details can be found in the data transfer plan for the 
central laboratory.   

Radiographic imaging reports (ie, x-ray, CT or MRI) confirming presence of bone 
metastasis (or lytic bone lesion from multiple myeloma) will be sent to the central 
imaging vendor preferably during screening and not later than one month after 
randomization.  For further details please refer to the vendor charter. 

7.1 

Screening 

Screening assessments conducted as standard of care do not require informed consent 
and may be provided as screening data if conducted within the required screening 
period. 

All screening procedures must be completed no more than 28 days before the day of 
randomization, with the following exceptions:

A

(cid:120)  Screening labs must be completed no more than 14 days before randomization 
(cid:120)  A negative pregnancy test, for women with reproductive potential, must be 

documented no more than 7 days before randomization.  The pregnancy test may be 
conducted locally or by the central laboratory.  If a pregnancy test result will be more 
than 7 days old at the time of randomization, the test must be repeated locally and 
documented in the CRF. 

Study day 1 (day of first dose of investigational product) must be planned within 8 
calendar days from randomization.  During the study, every effort should be made to 
keep subjects on the study schedule as planned from study day 1.   

7.2 

Medical History  

The subject’s medical history will be obtained prior to enrollment and recorded on the 
CRF.  Detailed history of cancer (including the date and staging of original diagnosis, 
tumor histology, date of diagnosis and location(s) of metastatic bone disease), and 
history of SRE and hypercalcemia will be obtained.

Treatment History 

Page 39 of 98 

Details of antineoplastic treatment and radiotherapy specifically used to treat the 
subject’s primary and metastatic cancer will be collected.   

7.4 

Physical Examination   

Each physical examination visit will include assessment of Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, height (during screening only), weight, 
and vital signs.  Refer to Appendix C for ECOG performance status criteria. 

7.5 

Oral Examination 

A visual examination of the oral cavity, including teeth, mucosa, and jaws, will be 
conducted by the investigator, or designated licensed healthcare professional, at 
screening, to establish baseline oral health conditions, and every 24 weeks thereafter 
(approximately every 6 months) to identify and document any new abnormalities or 
changes in pre-existing conditions. 

If any new abnormalities or changes in pre-existing conditions are identified, additional 
information may be requested. 

7.6 

Skeletal Survey (X-rays)  

Skeletal surveys must be conducted every 12 weeks and no more than 7 days before 
administration of the next dose of investigational products. 

Skeletal surveys will be sent from the site to the central imaging vendor for central 
reading.  Hard copy films or x-rays in a digitized format will be sent for each skeletal 
survey assessment.  Films will be blinded to treatment and subject identity, but will be 
unblinded to sequence (eg, baseline, on-study films/week number).  A study procedure 
manual will be provided to the local technologist by the vendor. 

The radiologic bone survey will consist of the following examinations: 

lateral skull 

(cid:120) 
(cid:120)  posteroanterior (PA) chest 
(cid:120)  anteroposterior (AP) and lateral cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine 
(cid:120)  AP pelvis 
(cid:120)  AP upper extremities, shoulder to elbow 
(cid:120)  AP lower extremities, hip to knee

Copies of any additional (ie, not scheduled per protocol) radiologic assessments taken in 
the course of standard of care (eg, an unscheduled x-ray to evaluate a suspected 
fracture) must also be sent to the vendor for central reading. 

7.6.1 

Vertebral Fracture 

Vertebral fractures will be identified by visual inspection by an expert radiologist (at the 
central imaging vendor).    

If the investigator clinically suspects a vertebral fracture, a radiograph is to be obtained.  
Copies of the radiographs and reports will be submitted to the central imaging vendor for 
confirmation of fracture.   

7.6.2 

Non-vertebral Fracture 

Any new, non-vertebral fractures occurring on study will be recorded.  A copy of 
radiographs confirming the fracture, as well as a copy of the radiologist’s report, should 
be obtained and included in the subject’s study records.  Copies of the radiographs will 
be submitted to the central imaging vendor for confirmation of fracture. 

7.7 

Skeletal Related Events (SRE) and Hypercalcemia of Malignancy (HCM) 

Occurrence of an SRE while receiving antiresorptive therapy does not necessarily 
indicate failure of treatment and subjects may still benefit from continuing to receive 
investigational product (Hillner et al, 2003).  If an SRE occurs on study, every effort 
should be made to continue the subject on investigational product.   

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

All subjects who experience an SRE, HCM, or other adverse event while on study will 
receive appropriate and definitive treatment as determined by their physician.  Treatment 
for SRE may include radiation, surgery, and/or the administration of bisphosphonates.  If 
the treating physician chooses oral or IV bisphosphonates as a course of action for the 
treatment of SRE or HCM, the subject will be discontinued from investigational product 
administration and continue with all other study assessments Q4W, without further 
investigational product administration, as per the schedule of assessments. 

7.7.1 

Skeletal Related Events 

SRE is defined as one or more of the following:  pathologic fracture (vertebral or 
non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to 
bone, or spinal cord compression. 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 41 of 98 

Pathologic fractures are those bone fractures that occur spontaneously or result from 
trivial trauma.  The nature of the trauma, whether trivial or otherwise, will be determined 
by investigator.  Vertebral fractures will include compression fractures, as defined in the 
vendor study guide. 

Surgery to bone includes procedures to set or stabilize a fracture or to prevent an 
imminent fracture or spinal cord compression.   

Radiation therapy to bone includes radiation for pain control (including use of 
radioisotopes), to treat or prevent pathologic fractures, or to treat or prevent spinal cord 
compression.   

Spinal cord compression events must be confirmed using appropriate radiographic 
imaging (eg, MRI or CT scans) and submitted to the central imaging reader for review. 

These events, as well as clinical sequelae associated with hypercalcemia, will be 
captured on the CRF.  The central reader will confirm fracture assessments and spinal 
cord compressions.   

7.7.2 

Hypercalcemia of Malignancy  

Hypercalcemia will be captured through central laboratory data.  Hypercalcemia is 
defined in this study as a serum calcium value (albumin-adjusted if necessary) of 
CTCAE version 3.0 grades 2 or greater (ie, (cid:116) 11.6 mg/dL; (cid:116) 3.0 mmol/L; ionized calcium 
(cid:116) 1.6 mmol/L).  Calculation of the serum calcium value (albumin adjusted, if necessary) 
will be conducted automatically by the central laboratory. 

7.8 

Laboratory Assessments  

All on-study samples will be collected, processed and sent to a central laboratory.  In 
order to calculate CrCl, a serum creatinine value must be obtained from a local 
laboratory, preferably on the day of, but no more than 14 days before, each 
investigational product administration.  Changes in serum creatinine may result in the 
need to withhold administration of the IV investigational product.  Refer to Section 6.1.3 
for details.

The central laboratory will be responsible for analyzing serum chemistry, hematology, 
and urine creatinine.  Amgen Inc, or its designee, will be responsible for analyzing serum

samples for the assessment of anti-denosumab antibodies and denosumab 
concentration levels and urine samples for uNTx.   

The central laboratory will provide a study manual that outlines handling, labeling, and 
shipping procedures for serum and urine samples.   

7.8.1 

Blood and Serum Assessments 

All blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture before investigational product 
administration.  The average volume of blood drawn per visit will be approximately 15 to 
25 mL.   

Blood will be obtained for the following assessments at the time points outlined in 
Appendix A.  Table 2 outlines the specific analytes for each assessment.  The date and 
time of blood collection will be recorded in the subjects’ medical records. 

Samples for serum denosumab concentration levels will be obtained on a subset of 
approximately 150 subjects prior to administration of the investigational products on 
study day 1, then on weeks 5, 9, 13, 25, 49, 73, 97, and at the end of study visit.  The 
centers that will participate in this part of the study will be determined at the time of site 
selection, on the basis of center interest, site ability to obtain and process serum 
denosumab concentration samples, and recruitment capacity.  A competitive enrollment 
strategy will be used at those centers selected to participate in this part of the trial.  
Serum levels for denosumab will be obtained in randomized subjects at these centers 
until approximately 150 subjects have been enrolled into the PK portion of the trial.

Serum samples for anti-denosumab antibody assay will be collected at baseline and as 
outlined on the schedule of assessments (Appendix A), including one sample during 
follow-up (24 weeks - approximately 6 months - after the last dose of investigational 
product).   

Serum for Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP) will be obtained at baseline, 
week 13 and the end of study.

Urine Assessments 

Urine samples will be collected for urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx).  Urine analytes will 
include creatinine and raw N-telopeptide (NTx).  Amgen Inc or its designee will perform 
the NTx assay.  The central laboratory will measure urine creatinine.   

The uNTx will be corrected for urine creatinine by generating a ratio. Using the uNTx as 
reported in units of nM and urine creatinine in units of mg/dL, the creatinine 
measurement will be multiplied by 0.0884, and used to generate the corrected ratio.  The 
resulting equation will be: 

uNTx/Cr (nM BCE/mM) = uNTx/(Cr*0.0884)

Urine Collection Instructions 

Page 44 of 98 

A morning urine sample (after the first morning void, before 12:00 pm) must be collected.  
It is recommended that urine samples be collected in the clinic, if feasible. 

If the subject is to collect the urine sample at home, he or she will need to be provided 
with containers for sample collection and for transporting the sample to the site on the 
day of collection.  Subject instructions will be provided on how and when to collect the 
sample, recording the time of collection, and storing the sample (refrigerated) until it is 
brought to the study site for processing.   

7.9 

PRO Assessments 

Three validated tools will be used including BPI-SF, FACT-G, and EQ-5D.  On 
scheduled visit dates, PRO assessments are to be completed before any other study 
procedures are performed. 

In the open-label treatment phase, only the BPI-SF will be completed. 

7.9.1 

Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form (BPI-SF)  

The BPI-SF (US-English sample provided in Appendix E) will be completed on study 
days 1, 8, 29 (week 5) and then every 4 weeks thereafter (ie, week 9, week 13, etc), 
until the end of the blinded treatment phase.  For the open-label treatment phase, 
BPI-SF will be completed every 4 weeks for the first 6 months, and then completed 
every 12 weeks thereafter until the end of study.

The BPI-SF is a questionnaire specifically designed to assess pain in cancer. The 
BPI-SF captures information on the intensity of pain (pain severity) as well as the degree 
to which pain interferes with function (pain interference).  Three single items, pain ‘at its 
worst’, pain you have right now, and pain interference with general activity are 
exploratory endpoints in this study.  The aggregate severity scale, which is comprised 
of 4 items, and the aggregate pain interference scale, which is comprised of 7 items, are 
also exploratory endpoints in this study.  Evidence for reliability and validity of the BPI-
SF has been well documented in cancer patients (Cleeland, 1991).

7.9.2 

Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General (FACT-G) 

The FACT-G questionnaire, consisting of the 27 questions for general cancer, will be 
completed on study days 1, 8 and 29 (week 5), and every 4 weeks thereafter (ie, week 
9, week 13, etc), until the end of the blinded treatment phase.   

The FACT-G is a widely used disease specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 
instrument that has been shown to be valid and reliable in patients with cancer.  It was 
developed in 1993 (Cella et al., 1993) and comprises 27 questions evaluating the 
HRQOL domains of physical well-being, functional well-being, social/family well-being, 
and emotional well-being in patients with cancer (US-English sample provided in 
Appendix F).   

7.9.3 

EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 

The EQ-5D will be completed on study days 1, 8, 29 (week 5) and then every 4 weeks 
thereafter (ie, week 9, week 13, etc), until the end of the blinded treatment phase. 

The EQ-5D (US-English sample provided in Appendix G), developed in 1990, is a widely 
used generic HRQOL instrument that allows for estimation of health utility. The EQ-5D 
is comprised of 6 questions.  The first 5 questions address the following quality of life 
dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression.  
Each of these questions has a simple three-category response scale.  The last question 
is represented by a 20-cm vertical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), scored from 0 to 100 
asking the patient to “mark your own health state today” (Brooks, 1996).

Healthcare Utilization 

Healthcare interactions (eg, emergency room/trauma center/urgent care, outpatient and 
home visits, hospitalizations), concomitant medications, imaging procedures and other 
information will be collected on the CRF until the end of the blinded treatment phase. 

7.11 

Disease Progression  

Overall disease progression will be assessed and documented by the investigator on the 
CRF, based on clinical observations.  Disease progression in bone will be based on 
independent review of radiographs.  The criteria for disease progression in bone are 
described in the central imaging vendor study guide and charter.

Early Withdrawal from Blinded Investigational Product 

Subjects who withdraw early from administration of blinded investigational products will 
continue with all other study assessments Q4W, without further investigational product 
administration, as per the schedule of assessments. 

7.13 

Survival Follow-up 

For subjects ending study participation before the open-label treatment phase,  
follow-up survival information will be collected by clinic visit or telephone contact every 
12 weeks (± 14 days) for 2 years after the end of study visit.  Additionally, a serum 
sample to evaluate for the presence of anti-denosumab antibodies is to be obtained 24 
weeks (approximately 6 months) after the end of study visit.  Subjects who early 
terminate from the study (ie, end study before the open-label treatment phase) 
must enter survival follow up following the end of study visit unless the end of 
study reason is death or withdrawal of consent.    

7.14 

Open-label Treatment Phase 

Informed consent must be obtained before the open-label treatment phase may 
begin.   

Refer to the schedule of assessments for details.

8.1 

REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS 

Removal of Subjects 

Subjects have the right to withdraw fully or partially from the study at any time and for 
any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the 
institution. 

Withdrawal of full consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further investigational treatment and does not wish to or is unable to continue further 
study participation.  Any subject may withdraw full consent to participate in the study at 
any time during the study.  The investigator will discuss with the subject the most 
appropriate way to withdraw to ensure the subject’s health.  

Withdrawal of partial consent means that the subject does not wish to take 
investigational product any longer but is still willing to collaborate in providing further

data by continuing on study (eg, participate in all subsequent study visits or procedures).  
Subjects may decline to continue receiving investigational product at any time during the 
study.  These subjects, as well as those who have stopped receiving investigational 
product for other reasons (eg, investigator or sponsor concern) should continue the 
schedule of study observations.  

Reasons for removal from investigational product might include: 
(cid:120)  withdrawal of partial or full consent 
(cid:120)  administrative decision by the investigator or Amgen 
(cid:120)  pregnancy (report on Pregnancy Notification Worksheet, see Appendix H)

(cid:120)  subject noncompliance 
(cid:120)  adverse event (report on adverse event CRF)
(cid:120)  administration of open-label/commercially obtained bisphosphonates

ineligibility 

Occurrence of an SRE while receiving antiresorptive therapy does not necessarily 
indicate failure of treatment and subjects may still benefit from continuing to receive 
investigational product (Hillner et al, 2003).  If an SRE occurs on study, every effort 
should be made to continue the subject on investigational products.

SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING 
Definitions 
Adverse Events 

An adverse event is defined in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2). 

This definition of adverse events is broadened in this study to include any such 
occurrence (eg, sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of a pre-existing medical 
condition from the time that a subject has signed informed consent.  Worsening of a pre-
existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) should be 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 48 of 98 

considered an adverse event if there is either an increase in severity, frequency, or 
duration of the condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes. 

Clinical sequelae associated with disease progression will be collected as adverse 
events (eg, metastases, including location, and progression-associated underlying 
diagnoses).  Disease progression as a general term should not be listed as an adverse 
event.  Signs and symptoms of disease progression should only be reported as adverse 
events if the underlying diagnosis (eg, organ failure) is unknown. 

Interventions for pretreatment conditions (eg, elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered adverse 
events. 

The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from 
values before the study.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical 
significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as adverse 
events; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment in prior 
therapy are considered adverse events. 

9.1.2 

Serious Adverse Events 

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that 

is fatal 
is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

A hospitalization meeting the regulatory definition for “serious” is any inpatient hospital 
admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility. 

Any adverse event that does not meet one of the definitions of serious (eg, emergency 
room visit, outpatient surgery, or requires urgent investigation) may be considered by the 
investigator to meet the “other significant medical hazard” criterion for classification as a 
serious adverse event.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and 
blood dyscrasias

Page 49 of 98 

Elective hospitalizations for the routine administration of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or 
the therapeutic blood products are not considered Serious Adverse Events. However, 
prolongation of hospitalization or readmission after the subject has been discharged post 
radiotherapy or chemotherapy would be considered a Serious Adverse Event.

9.2 

Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 

The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (as defined in 
Section 9.1) observed by the investigator or reported by subjects are properly captured 
in the subjects’ medical records, with one exclusion:  those that both occur before 
initiation of study treatment and are deemed by the investigator to be unrelated to study 
screening. 

In addition, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that, for those subjects 
randomized to investigational product, all adverse events captured on the subjects’ 
medical records (as specified above) are reported on the CRF. 

SREs are to be recorded on the Skeletal Related Events CRF. 

The following adverse event attributes must be assigned by the investigator:  adverse 
event diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known), event 
description (with detail appropriate to the event), dates of onset and resolution, severity, 
assessment of relatedness to investigational products, and action taken.  The 
investigator may be asked to provide follow-up information, discharge summaries, and 
extracts from medical records or CRFs. 

If applicable, the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational products will be 
assessed by means of the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by the investigational products?”  The investigator should 
respond to this question with either Yes or No. 

d

If the adverse event occurred before initiation of investigational products, the relationship 
of the adverse event to study screening is to be assessed by means of the question:  “Is 
there a reasonable possibility that the event may have occurred because of study 
screening?”  The investigator should respond to this question with either Yes or No.  If 
the answer is Yes, record what part of the study screening is suspected. 

CTCAE severity grading scales, version 3.0, are described in Appendix I. 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 50 of 98 

Medically significant adverse events considered related to the investigational product by 
the investigator or the sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable. 

It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse 
event is related and of sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment 
or from the study.  A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what 
he or she perceives as an intolerable adverse event.  If either of these situations arises, 
the subject should be strongly encouraged to undergo an end-of-study assessment and 
be under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable. 

9.3 

Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures 

Serious adverse events will be collected and recorded throughout the study period, 
beginning with initiation of investigational product through 30 days after the last dose of 
investigational product(s) or end of the study, whichever is longer.  Serious adverse 
events considered by the investigator as possibly related to study screening 
activities will also be collected during the period between randomization and the 
first dose of investigational product. 

All countries except Japan:  All serious adverse events that are recorded in subjects’ 
medical records (as specified above) must be reported to Amgen within 1 working day of 
discovery or notification of the event.  Initial serious adverse event information and all 
amendments or additions must be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form 
(Appendix J) and faxed to Amgen Global Safety.

Japan only:  All serious adverse events that are recorded in subjects’ medical records 
(as specified above) must be reported to Amgen within 1 working day of discovery or 
notification of the event.  Initial serious adverse event information and all amendments or 
additions must be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report form and submitted to 
Amgen. 

For regulatory reporting purposes, serious adverse events also will be collected and 
reported within 1 working day of discovery or notification of the event if it occurs 
> 30 days after the last dose of investigational product or after the end of the study AND 
is thought to be possibly related to investigational product. 

All countries except Japan:  For all deaths, available autopsy reports and relevant 
medical reports should be faxed to Amgen Global Safety.  For this reporting process, 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244

Page 51 of 98 

subject assessments must be made 30 days or longer after administration of the last 
dose of investigational product.  

Japan only:  For all deaths, available autopsy reports and relevant medical reports 
should be submitted to Amgen.  For this reporting process, subject assessments must 
be made 30 days or longer after administration of the last dose of investigational 
product.  

To comply with worldwide serious adverse event reporting regulations, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
will be unblinded before submission to regulatory authorities.  Determination of 
expectedness by Amgen personnel for regulatory reporting purposes will be 
based on Appendices A and B of the investigator’s brochure.  Additionally, in this 
population SREs are expected adverse events.  An external data monitoring committee 
(DMC) will monitor SREs at regular intervals as outlined in the DMC charter. 

If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study because of a serious adverse 
event, this information must be included in the initial or follow-up Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form as well as the End of Study Case Report Form. 

All countries except Japan:  The investigator should notify the appropriate IRB or 
ethics committee of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event 
reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Study Design 

10.1 
This is an international phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active controlled study 
comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid in the treatment of bone metastases in 
subjects with advanced cancer or multiple myeloma.  Approximately 1690 subjects will 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 52 of 98 

be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either denosumab or zoledronic acid. 
Randomization will be stratified by tumor type (non-small cell lung cancer or multiple 
myeloma or other), previous SRE (Yes or No), systemic anti-cancer therapy 
(eg, chemotherapy, biologic therapy or hormonal therapy; Yes or No). Details are 
provided in Section 3.1. 

A data monitoring committee (DMC) will review safety and efficacy data at regular 
intervals of approximately twice yearly during the blinded treatment phase.

Study Endpoints, Subsets, and Covariates 

10.2.1 

Study Endpoints 

Primary Endpoint 

(cid:120)  Time to the first on-study SRE (non-inferiority) 

SRE is an aggregate endpoint that includes pathologic fracture (vertebral or 
non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to 
bone, or spinal cord compression.   

Secondary Endpoints:  

(cid:120) 
(cid:120) 

time to the first on-study SRE (superiority) 
time to the first-and-subsequent on-study SRE (superiority, using multiple event 
analysis)  

For the time to first-and-subsequent on-study SRE, a multiple event analysis will be 
used, which accounts for both the absolute number of SREs and for the time between 
two consecutive events, and therefore, provides a more sensitive assessment of the risk 
of experiencing an SRE.  To be considered as a subsequent event, the SRE must occur 
at least 21 days after the previous SRE.  A supportive analysis excluding the 21-day 
window (that is, counting each SRE as a separate SRE, regardless of proximity to other 
SREs) will also be performed.

The principal analysis for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will employ the 
full analysis set (FAS) approach; the per-protocol approach will be considered 
supportive.  The safety analyses will be performed using the FAS subjects who received 
at least one dose of investigational drug.    The FAS subset is defined as all subjects 
who are randomized to the study. The per-protocol subset is defined as all subjects with 
a protocol-defined diagnosis, no major protocol violations and who received at least one 
dose of investigational product. The major protocol violations will be defined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   

Analyses of PRO endpoints will be performed using the PRO analysis subset. This 
subset includes all subjects who are randomized and have at least one PRO 
assessment.  Analyses of healthcare utilization and analgesic scores will be 
performed using FAS.

10.3.1 

Non-inferiority Design

A

The primary endpoint for this study is time to first on-study SRE (non-inferiority).  Since 
this is a non-inferiority design, historical data from the literature must be used to estimate 
the hazard ratio of the placebo arm compared with the active control arm, zoledronic 
acid. 

Because there is limited data directly comparing zoledronic acid against placebo, the 
estimate of the hazard ratio of placebo compared with zoledronic acid was based on a 
three-step approach. 1) A solid tumor trial comparing placebo with zoledronic acid 
provided an initial estimate of the hazard ratio for placebo relative to zoledronic acid 
2) Data from one multiple myeloma trial comparing placebo with pamidronate were 
combined with data from another multiple myeloma trial comparing zoledronic acid with 
pamidronate in order to obtain a second estimate of the hazard ratio for placebo relative 
to zoledronic acid. 3) The results of step 1 were combined with the results of step 2 in

order to obtain an overall estimate for placebo relative to zoledronic acid in subjects with 
advanced cancer (excluding breast and prostate cancer) or multiple myeloma. The 
details are given below. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Zoledronic acid was compared with placebo in Novartis solid tumor trial 011 
(Statistical Review and Evaluation of Zometa).  In this trial, in subjects with a 
solid tumor, the hazard ratio for time to first on-study SRE for placebo relative 
to zoledronic acid was 1.36 with 95% CI (1.04, 1.80).   

In multiple myeloma patients, pamidronate was compared with placebo in 
Novartis trial 12 and zoledronic acid was compared with pamidronate in 
Novartis trial 10 (Statistical Review and Evaluation of Aredia).  In Novartis 
trial 12 the hazard ratio for placebo relative to pamidronate was 1.45 with 
95% CI (1.07, 2.0).  In Novartis trial 10 the hazard ratio for zoledronic acid 
relative to pamidronate was 0.97 with 95% CI (0.71, 1.31).  By combining 
data from these two trials, the hazard ratio for placebo relative to zoledronic 
acid in multiple myeloma subjects is calculated as 1.50 with 95% CI (0.97, 
2.32). 

By combining the results in step 1 with the results of step 2, the hazard ratio 
for placebo relative to zoledronic acid in subjects with advanced cancer 
(excluding breast or prostate cancer) or multiple myeloma was calculated as 
1.40 with 95% CI (1.11, 1.77).

This 3-step approach provides an unbiased estimate of the effect of placebo relative to 
zoledronic acid and appropriate standard errors. Of note, while some deviations from the 
historic trials are unavoidable (eg, for updated safety requirements), the features of the 
population under study as well as the dose and schedule of zoledronic acid as 
comparator are fully within the currently approved Zometa label. 

Randomization will be stratified by tumor type (non-small cell lung cancer or multiple 
myeloma or other), previous SRE (Yes or No), systemic anti-cancer therapy 
(eg, chemotherapy, biologic therapy or hormonal therapy; Yes or No), and region (Japan 
or other countries).  The existence of a previous SRE has been identified as a risk factor 
for additional SREs.  Stratification for tumor type will be bounded for this study, limiting 
the enrollment to the non-small cell lung cancer stratum to 60% and multiple myeloma to 
10%.  While some differences in study design and inclusion criteria exist between the 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 56 of 98 

historical zoledronic acid trials (Novartis Studies 12 and 10) [multiple myeloma subset], 
Novartis Study 011 [solid tumor] and the planned noninferiority trial of denosumab vs 
zoledronic acid in subjects with advanced cancer (excluding breast and prostate cancer) 
or multiple myeloma, the differences are minor and not expected to significantly affect 
the endpoints of study 20050244.  Therefore constancy can be reasonably claimed for 
the planned phase 3 development of denosumab compared with the phase 3
development of zoledronic acid and a comparison between denosumab and zoledronic 
acid based on a non-inferiority hypothesis is deemed valid. 

10.3.2 

Sample Size  

If the true hazard ratio for time to first on-study SRE is 0.9, 745 subjects with at least one 
SRE among the 1690 planned subjects provide a 91% power to detect non-inferiority of 
denosumab to zoledronic acid, based on a synthesis approach (Hung et al., 2003), 
designed to demonstrate that denosumab preserves at least 50% of the effect of 
zoledronic acid.  Assuming a true hazard ratio of 0.8 for both secondary endpoints and a 
correlation coefficient of 0.6 between the two endpoints, this number of subjects with 
SRE will also provide 90% power to detect superiority of denosumab to zoledronic acid 
for at least one of the secondary endpoints.  With 1690 subjects, an enrollment period of 
23 months, and a loss to follow-up rate of 5% per year and death rate of 50% per year, 
the study should reach the primary analysis data cut-off date in approximately 30 
months.  The median time to the first on-study SRE for the zoledronic acid treated 
subjects is expected to be 250 days. 

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

Amgen will also monitor the rate of SRE pooled by treatment group; if it is lower than 
expected, Amgen may choose to modify the sample size. 

The calculated sample size accounts for a death rate of approximately 50% of subjects 
per year.  The death rate represents an estimated composite rate based on published 
data for the solid tumor (NSCLC - approximately 70% per year; other solid tumors - 
approximately 25% per year) and multiple myeloma (approximately 25% per year) 
subject populations.  

The sample size is based on a median time to the first on-study SRE for the zoledronic 
acid treated subjects of 250 days.  This represents an estimated composite median time 
based on published data for the solid tumor (NSCLC - approximately 171 days; other 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab

Page 57 of 98 

solid tumors - approximately 314 days) (Rosen et al, 2003a) and multiple myeloma 
(approximately 380 days) (Rosen et al, 2003b) subject populations.   

If there is a significant deviation either the estimated death rate or the estimated median 
time to SRE, a significantly delay may occur in the overall time required to complete. 

10.4 

Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments 

This is a double-blinded study.  Subject treatment assignments will remain blinded to 
investigator, subjects and Amgen Inc in order to reduce bias, except as described in 
Section 5.3. 

The external DMC will have access to subject treatment assignments. To minimize the 
potential introduction of bias, these individuals will not have any direct contact with the 
study site personnel or subjects.  

The identity of investigational product assigned to subjects or to individual boxes of 
investigational product will be contained in the IVRS.  Authorized site staff will be 
provided with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the IVRS to 
obtain unblinding information.  This PIN is unique to the individual and must not be 
shared. 

A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject.  Unblinding at the study 
site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. The principal 
investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Study Manager before 
unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working day after 
the event and must document the unblinding in the subject’s case report form.   

d
e
v
o
r
p
p
A

Individuals in Amgen Biological Sample Management, Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical 
Immunology may be unblinded in order to identify subjects who received denosumab for 
the purposes of pharmacokinetic and anti-denosumab antibody analyses.  Samples from 
subjects randomized to zoledronic acid will not be tested. 

10.5 

Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines 

An external DMC will be formed with members consisting of individuals chosen for their 
expertise in oncology and bone disease.  The role of this external DMC will be to monitor 
safety and efficacy.  This external DMC will convene approximately twice yearly, and the 

 

 

Product:  Denosumab 
Protocol Number:  20050244 
Date: 05 May 2008 

Page 58 of 98 

start date will depend on subject accrual rates.  The study will not be stopped early 
simply based on overwhelming evidence of non-inferiority.  For superiority, the study 
should not stop unless the result for the primary endpoint achieves a p-value of 0.0005. 
Due to the conservative nature of this rule, there will be no adjustment to the final 
significance level of the trial. 

Selected Amgen Inc staff may serve as liaisons to the external DMC, but will not be 
voting members, and will not be unblinded to the results.  The DMC will have access to 
subject’s individual treatment assignments. To minimize the potential introduction of 
bias, these individuals will not have any direct contact with the study site personnel or 
subjects.  Members of this external DMC will include, at a minimum, physicians external 
to Amgen Inc, and appropriate statistical representation external to Amgen Inc.  
Unblinded reports of safety data for review will also be generated by entities that are 
external to Amgen Inc.  Records of all meetings will be archived.  The DMC will 
communicate major safety concerns and recommendations regarding study modification 
or termination to Amgen Inc senior management.  Details regarding the DMC will be 
provided in the DMC charter. 

10.6 

Planned Methods of Analysis through the Primary Analysis Data Cut-off 
Date 

10.6.1 

General Approach/Considerations 

Amgen will set a primary analysis data cut-off date in anticipation of 745 subjects 
having experienced at least one on-study SRE.  The analysis will be based on the data 
from randomization through the primary analysis data cut-off date. 

The principal analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints will employ the FAS 
approach (refer to Section 10.2.2) and per-protocol approach will be considered 
supportive.  Safety analyses will be performed using the FAS subjects who received at 
least one dose of investigational product.   

A synthesis approach (Hung et al, 2003) will be used for the non-inferiority test for the 
primary endpoint.  We will use the combined estimate of zoledronic acid’s effect relative 
to placebo based on the 3 historical studies and the 3-step approach, as described in 
Section 10.3.1.  In order to demonstrate 50% preservation of effect these historical data 
will be combined with the estimate of denosumab’s effect relative to zoledronic acid from 
this trial, to estimate denosumab’s effect relative to placebo.  If the upper bound of the

Page 59 of 98 

95% confidence interval (two-sided) of the hazard ratio of denosumab to placebo is less 
than 1, then denosumab will be declared non-inferior to zoledronic acid, and we will 
proceed with a test for superiority. 

For time to first-and-subsequent on study SRE (multiple event analysis), the Prentice, 
Williams and Peterson (PWP) (Prentice et al, 1981) approach will be used. 

Subjects who die without having had a primary endpoint will be censored at the time of 
death in the analysis. Subjects who withdraw from investigational product early will be 
followed for the development of the primary and secondary endpoints whenever 
possible.  Subjects lost to follow-up will be censored at the lost to follow-up date.  
Otherwise subjects not experiencing the composite event will be censored at the 
primary analysis data cut-off date. 

If denosumab is determined to be non-inferior to zoledronic acid with respect to the 
primary efficacy hypothesis, the two secondary efficacy hypotheses will be tested 
simultaneously, and the Hochberg procedure (Westfall et al, 1999) will be employed to 
control the overall type I error for the secondary efficacy hypotheses at a level of 0.05.   

10.6.2 

Analysis of Key Study Endpoints 

10.6.2.1  Efficacy Analysis 

Primary Endpoint 

For time to first on-study SRE, Kaplan-Meier estimates (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) will be 
graphically displayed and a Cox model (Cox, 1972) with treatment groups as the 
independent variable and stratified by the randomization stratification factors will be 
used.  A supportive analysis will use a Cox model to evaluate the covariates that may 
modify the outcome.  The estimated hazard ratio and standard error from this model will 
be combined with the historical estimate and standard error of zoledronic acid’s effect 
relative to placebo, as described in Section 10.3.1, to determine whether or not 
denosumab is non-inferior to zoledronic acid.   

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 

If denosumab is found to be non-inferior, then the results of the Cox model will be used 
directly to determine whether or not denosumab is superior to zoledronic acid.  A 
supportive analysis will be performed for time to first on-study SRE, where death is

included in the definition of SRE, using similar methods.  For time to 
first-and-subsequent on study SRE (multiple event analysis), the PWP approach will be 
used.  A supportive analysis excluding the 21-day window will also be performed.   

10.6.2.2  Safety Analysis 

Safety data will be summarized for all patients who receive at least 1 dose of 
investigational product.   

Subject Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events  

All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  Any adverse events will be analyzed as treatment emergent if the indicator 
of “Did event start before the first dose of investigational product” is checked as “No” on 
Adverse Events Summary CRF pages.  Based on the AEs summary instructions, an AE 
that exists prior to the administration of IP and gets worse after the first dose of IP will be 
included as a treatment emergent adverse event.  The analysis of adverse events will be 
descriptive.  The subject incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events reported 
through the primary analysis data cut-off date during the study period will be 
tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.  Additional summary tables will be 
provided separately for serious adverse events, Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events, adverse events leading to 
investigational product discontinuation, and adverse events leading to study withdrawal.  
Narratives of deaths and serious adverse events will also be provided.  All 
investigational product related adverse events, serious adverse events, CTCAE grade 3, 
4 or 5 adverse events, adverse events leading to investigational product 
discontinuation and adverse events leading to study withdrawal will be summarized in 
the same manner as treatment-emergent adverse events.

Changes in Laboratory Values 

Laboratory parameters will be summarized over time using descriptive statistics for 
recorded values and change from baseline and shifts tables, in which the incidence of 
shift of toxicity grade (CTCAE version 3.0) in recorded values from baseline to “worst” 
on-study value is displayed.  Graphical representations of aggregate data may also be 
presented for parameters of interests.

Page 61 of 98 

The incidence and percentages of subjects who develop anti-denosumab antibodies 
(binding and neutralizing) at anytime will be tabulated. 

10.6.2.3  Exploratory Analyses 

BPI – Worst Pain   
The analysis of this endpoint will include a piecewise growth curve model 
(Fairclough et al, 2004).  If the difference between groups in analgesic use 
demonstrates significantly greater use of analgesics with denosumab, then analgesic 
score will be an additional covariate. 

First On-study Radiation to Bone 

The occurrence of radiation to bone is one of the most frequently reported 
skeletal-related events when evaluating skeletal morbidity.  Kaplan-Meier estimates 
(Kaplan and Meier, 1958) will be graphically displayed and a Cox model (Cox, 1972) 
with treatment group as the independent variable and stratified by the randomization 
stratification factors will be used to evaluate this endpoint.   

First On-study SRE or HCM  

HCM is a systemic and reversible event reported in this disease population.  
Kaplan-Meier estimates (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) will be graphically displayed and a 
Cox model (Cox, 1972) with treatment group as the independent variable and stratified 
by the randomization stratification factors will be used to evaluate this endpoint.

Analgesic Use 

The analysis of analgesic use will be based on analgesic score (refer to Appendix D for 
the Analgesic Quantification Algorithm) evaluated from enrollment to the primary 
analysis data cut-off date.  The analysis of this endpoint will include a piecewise 
growth curve model. 

Other Clinical Outcomes (Disease Progression and Overall Survival) 

Overall disease progression will be assessed and documented by the investigator on the 
case report form, based on clinical observations.  Disease progression in bone will be 
based on independent review of radiographs.  The criteria for disease progression in

bone are described in the central imaging vendor study guide and charter.  Time to 
disease progression in bone for each treatment group will be estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier method and the hazard ratio will be estimated using a Cox model.  Similar 
approaches will be used to study time to overall disease progression and overall 
survival. 

Proportion of Subjects with an SRE by 49 Weeks and by the Primary Analysis Data 
Cut-off Date  

The proportion of subjects with an SRE by 49 weeks and by the Primary Analysis Data 
Cut-off Date and their respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided for each 
treatment group. 

Healthcare Utilization 

Healthcare utilization will be summarized between treatment groups. 

Patient Reported Outcomes Assessments 

Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) assessments will be summarized descriptively by 
visit. 

Analysis of the PRO assessments will employ a piecewise growth curve model 
(Fairclough et al, 2004)

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 
Investigational Products 

Denosumab will be presented as a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative free liquid in 
blinded-label, single-use 3.0 mL glass vials containing approximately 1.7 mL of 70 mg 
denosumab per mL of 10 mM Sodium Acetate, 5% sorbitol, with a pH of 5.2.  Placebo 
will be presented in matched containers and the formulation will be identical to 
denosumab with the exception of the protein content.  

Active control medication will include zoledronic acid and will be presented in identical 
containers or other packaging.  Preparation details will be given in the Pharmacy Guide 
(Appendix B) including any modification from their usual commercial state and steps 
taken to assure unaltered bioavailability. 

The box number of each investigational product (active drug, placebo, or active control 
medication) is to be recorded on each subject’s investigational product administration 
CRF.   

Principal Investigators (or equivalent in Japan) will be provided with IVRS PIN numbers 
with access to unblind subject treatment assignments.  Refer to Sections 10.4 and 11.2 
for conditions and requirements for unblinding. Investigational product details for 
denosumab and zoledronic acid, including labeling, storage, preparation, etc., are 
provided in the Pharmacy Guide.

11.2 

Access to Treatment Assignments 

The identity of investigational product assigned to subject numbers or to individual boxes 
of investigational product will be available for emergency situations through an IVRS.  
Authorized site staff will be provided with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) 
to access the IVRS to obtain unblinding information.  This PIN is unique to the individual 
and must not be shared.

A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject.  Unblinding at the study 
site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. 

The principal investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen study manager 
before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working

REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS 

Informed Consent 

An initial generic informed consent form will be provided for the investigator to prepare 
the informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template 
will be communicated by letter from the clinical study manager to the investigator.  The 
written informed consent document should be prepared in the language(s) of the 
potential subject population. 

Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any 
protocol-specific screening procedures or any investigational products are administered.  
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject agrees to have 
his/her primary care physician informed of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  
If the subject agrees to such notification, the investigator shall inform the subject’s 
primary care physician of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.

All countries except Japan:  The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s 
agreement or refusal of his/her notification of the primary care physician should be 
documented in the subject’s medical records, and the informed consent form should be 
signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion (not necessarily an investigator).  The original signed 
informed consent form should be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a 
copy of the signed consent form should be provided to the subjects or legally acceptable 
representative.

13.5 

Publication Policy 

To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen encourages the formation of 
a publication committee consisting of several principal investigators and appropriate 
Amgen staff.  The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other 
investigators and Amgen staff as appropriate.  Membership on the committee (both for 
investigators and Amgen staff) does not guarantee authorship—the criteria described 
below should be met for every publication. 

Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 2004), which states: 

(cid:120)  Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 

design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3. 

(cid:120)  When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify 

the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. 

(cid:120)  Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 

group, alone, does not justify authorship. 

(cid:120)  All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 

qualify should be listed. 

(cid:120)  Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 

responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 

All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for corporate review.  The Clinical 
Study Agreement among the institution, principal investigator, and Amgen Inc will detail 
the procedures for, and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications. 

13.6 

Compensation  

Subject will be treated and/or compensated for any study-related illness/injury pursuant 
to the information provided in the Compensation for Injury section of the Informed 
Consent.

The identity of investigational product assigned to subject numbers or to individual boxes 
of investigational product will be contained in the IVRS.  Authorized site staff will be 
provided with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the IVRS to 
obtain unblinding information. This PIN is unique to the individual and must not be 
shared.  A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of 
the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject. Unblinding at the 
study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. 

The principal investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Study Manager 
before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working 
day after the event and must document the unblinding in the subject’s case report form.

Open-Label Packaging and Formulation 

Page 83 of 98 

Denosumab will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc and distributed 
using Amgen clinical trial drug distribution procedures. 

Denosumab will be presented as a sterile, colorless to slightly yellow, practically 
free from particles, preservative free liquid in 3.0 mL glass vials of 70 mg 
denosumab per mL of 10 mM Sodium Acetate, 5% Sorbitol in Water for Injection, 
and has a pH of 5.2.   

Open-label investigational product will be packaged in boxes containing 
single-use vials of denosumab. 

Boxes will be assigned for each dose the subject will receive while on study. To 
obtain box number assignment for a scheduled dose, site personnel should call 
the IVRS vendor. The box numbers of investigational products are to be recorded 
on each subject’s Drug Administration case report form.  In addition, the subject’s 
identification number, randomization identification number and box numbers 
must be written on all appropriate drug accountability and dispensing records. 

 

Blinded Treatment Labeling 

Each single-use vial of denosumab or placebo will list the investigational product 
name/placebo, total drug content, route of administration, regional appropriate clinical 
trial statement, storage conditions, and the sponsor name. Information presented on the 
label for study medication will comply with the local regulatory requirements.

The boxes containing denosumab or placebo will be stored at 5(cid:113) (cid:114) 3(cid:113)C.  Exposure of the 
material to temperatures outside these limits may result in a loss of activity.   Amgen Inc 
or its designee must be notified if any test material is exposed to excessive or 
uncontrolled temperatures, in which case possible replacement of the material will be 
considered. 

Records of actual storage conditions during the period of the study must be maintained 
and include the date, time and initials of the person checking on the “working day” 
temperatures of the refrigerator used for the storage of trial supplies. Continuous 
temperature recordings, or regularly maintained temperature alarm systems used in 
conjunction with temperature recording shall also be maintained. 

Preparation 

Each box of denosumab/matching placebo will contain one 3.0 mL vial filled with 1.7 mL 
of denosumab or matching placebo.  Each box of open-label denosumab will contain 
multiple 3.0 mL vials, each filled with 1.7 mL. A singe syringe should be used to 
prepare the dose.  It is recommended that investigational product be brought to ambient 
temperature before administering to the subject.  Administration of the investigational 
product must occur within 4 hours after removal from storage at 5(cid:113) (cid:114) 3(cid:113)C. In the blinded 
treatment phase, injections are to be given prior to the administration of IV comparator.  
There are no other special preparations required prior to investigational product 
administration.

Zoledronic Acid (Zometa(cid:147))-(Blinded Treatment Phase) 

Zoledronic acid/matching placebo will be supplied in a blinded manner by the Sponsor 
as a sterile liquid concentrate solution for intravenous infusion.  The commercial form of 
zoledronic acid has not been altered. 

Each 5-mL of the active comparator contains 4.264 mg of zoledronic acid monohydrate, 
corresponding to 4 mg zoledronic acid on an anhydrous basis.  Inactive ingredients 
include 220 mg mannitol, USP, as bulking agent, water for injection, and 24 mg sodium 
citrate, USP, as buffering agent.   

The matching placebo is a liquid formulation containing inactive ingredients, 16mM 
Sodium Citrate, 4.4% mannitol, pH 6.2 designed to mimic Zometa® brand of zoledronic 
acid.

The concentrate (or matching placebo) is to be diluted in either 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 
USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.  For further details on preparation and dose, refer 
to the Zometa(cid:147) prescribing information. 

Supply and Return of Investigational Products 

At study initiation and as needed thereafter, investigational products will be shipped to a 
responsible person (eg, a pharmacist) at the investigator’s institution, who will check the 
amount and condition of the drug and enter these data into the Proof of Receipt Form.  
The Proof of Receipt Form should then be returned to Amgen, and the original retained 
at the site. 

The person responsible for receiving the drug shipment will also need to contact the 
IVRS vendor to confirm receipt of investigational product.  

At the end of the study, or as directed, all investigational product supplies, including 
unused, partially used, or empty containers, will be returned to the Amgen designee. 

Investigational Product Accountability 

An Investigational Product Accountability Record for the investigational products 
mandated by the protocol must be kept current and should contain: 

• the dates and quantities of investigational product received from Amgen 
• manufacturing lot number AND box numbers for product received 
• subject’s identification (subject number) 
• date and box numbers of investigational product dispensed 
• the initials of the dispenser 

 

Return of Investigational Product for Destruction 

The Return of Investigational Product for Destruction Form must be completed and 
included in the shipment of used and unused investigational product to Amgen or 
designee. At the end of the study, the Final Investigational product Reconciliation 
Statement must be completed and provided to Amgen. 

These inventories must be made available for inspection by an authorized Amgen 
representative or designee and regulatory agency inspectors. The investigator is 
responsible for the accountability of all used and unused trial supplies.

Adverse Event Relatedness 

Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by investigational 
product?  No___ Yes___ 

The descriptions provided below will help guide the principal investigator in making the 
decision to choose either “yes” or “no”: 

No = There is not a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
investigational product. 

The adverse event: 

(cid:120)  may be judged to be due to extraneous causes such as disease or environment 

or toxic factors

Amendment # 1 

Protocol Title:  A Randomised, Double-Blind, Multicenter Study of Denosumab 

Compared With Zoledronic Acid (Zometa®) in the Treatment of Bone Mtastases in 

Subjects with Advanced Cancer (Excluding Breats and Prostate Cancer) or 

Multiple Myeloma 

Amgen Protocol Number Denosumab 20050244 

IND # 9838 

Eudract # 2006-000848-65 

05 May 2008 

Amendment Date: 
 
Rationale:
Protocol 20050244 is an event driven trial, with the end of study previously defined as 
four weeks after the anticipated date that the 745th subject experiences a first on-study 
SRE.   
The purpose of this amendment is to continue all subjects currently undergoing every 4 
weeks scheduled assessments on blinded investigational product treatment until the 
primary analysis is completed.   If denosumab is determined to have a positive 
benefit:risk profile compared with zoledronic acid, all subjects currently undergoing every 
4 weeks scheduled assessments will be offered open-label denosumab at a dose of 120 
mg SC until subjects have access to commercially available product or for up to 2 years, 
which ever comes first.  If denosumab is determined not to have a positive benefit:risk 
profile compared with zoledronic acid, all subjects will complete an end of study visit 4 
weeks after the last dose of blinded IP and be followed for survival for up to 2 years. 
The benefit:risk profile will be evaluated using safety and efficacy data collected through 
the primary analysis data cut off date, defined as the anticipated date when 
approximately 745 subjects experiences at least one on-study SRE.  Achieving the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be required to demonstrate benefit. 
The estimated range of time on the blinded treatment phase for an individual participant 
will be 11 to 34 months, based on actual enrollment and observed attrition.   
All ongoing subjects must be re-consented to participate in the open-label extension with 
an addendum to the ICF which includes only new information not included in the full ICF. 
Summary of changes: 
(cid:120)  Details for the open-label treatment phase were incorporated throughout the protocol 
(cid:120)  End of study and termination date were revised throughout the protocol  
(cid:120)  Clarifications were added to sections on PROs, safety reporting, and covariates 
(cid:120)  Typographic and formatting errors, redundancies and inconsistencies were 

corrected.

Each subject will receive either an SC injection of denosumab and an IV infusion of 
zoledronic acid placebo Q4W, or an SC injection of denosumab placebo and an IV 
infusion of zoledronic acid Q4W until approximately 745 subjects have experienced an 
on-study SRE and the primary efficacy and safety analysis is completed.   
An SRE is defined as pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy 
to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord 
compression. 
If denosumab is determined to have a positive benefit:risk profile compared with 
zoledronic acid, all subjects currently undergoing every 4 weeks scheduled 
assessments will be offered open-label denosumab at a dose of 120 mg SC until 
subjects have access to commercially available product or for up to 2 years, 
which ever comes first.  If the benefit:risk profile is not positive, all subjects will 
be followed for survival for 2 years after the last dose of blinded IP.

Section:  3.4 Estimated Study Duration   
First and second paragraph 
Add: 
The anticipated total duration of the blinded treatment phase will be approximately 
34 months from first subject enrolled.  This represents subject recruitment, time 
for approximately 745 subjects to experience at least one on-study SRE, and 
continued blinded treatment until the primary analysis is complete and the 
benefit:risk profile of denosumab is determined. Actual study duration may be 
longer or shorter, depending on the time it takes for approximately 745 subjects to 
experience an on-study SRE.
Following the blinded treatment phase, if positive benefit:risk is determined then 
all subjects continuing with every 4 weeks scheduled assessments will be offered 
open-label denosumab.  Otherwise, subjects will be followed for survival for up to 
2 years (24 months). 
 
Section:  3.4.1 Study Duration for Participants   
Last paragraph 
Add: 
The estimated range of time on the blinded treatment phase for an individual 
participant is 11 to 34 months, based on actual enrollment and observed attrition.
The open-label or survival follow-up phase will be up to 2 years.  The maximum 
study participation for an individual subject will be approximately 58 months.  
Actual study duration for individual participants may be longer or shorter, 
depending on the time it takes for approximately 745 subjects to experience at 
least one on-study SRE. 
 
Section:  3.4.2 End of Study   
Last 3 paragraphs of page 28 and 1st paragraph page 29 
Add: 
If the benefit:risk is positive, the end of study is defined as 4 weeks after the last 
dose of denosumab in the open-label treatment phase.  If the benefit:risk is not 
positive, the end of study is defined as 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational 
product in the end of the blinded treatment phase.
Amgen will set a primary analysis data cut-off date for the primary analysis in 
anticipation of 745 subjects having experienced an on-study SRE.  Hence, the analysis 
will be based on the data from randomization through the primary analysis data cut-off 
date.  
…Because of this and because prior use of oral bisphosphonate (for osteoporosis) is 
allowed in this study, it may take longer than the proposed 30 months (from the 1st
subject enrolled) to observe 745 subjects experiencing a first on-study SRE, which may 
delay the overall time required to reach the primary analysis data cut-off date.

Section: 7.9.1 Section: Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form (BPI-SF)  
Second paragraph 
Add: 
The BPI-SF is a questionnaire specifically designed to assess pain in cancer. The 
BPI-SF captures information on the intensity of pain (pain severity) as well as the degree 
to which pain interferes with function (pain interference).  Three single items, pain ‘at its 
worst’, pain you have right now, and pain interference with general activity are 
exploratory endpoints in this study.  The aggregate severity scale, which is comprised of 
4 items, and the aggregate pain interference scale, which is comprised of 7 items, are 
also exploratory endpoints in this study.  Evidence for reliability and validity of the 
BPI-SF has been well documented in cancer patients (Cleeland CS, 1991).

The analysis of this endpoint will employ a mixed effects model (Longford, 1993). If any 
observed benefit in pain is accompanied by a reduction of analgesic use, then the pain 
analysis will be unadjusted.  However, if the point estimate for the difference between 
groups in analgesic use suggests greater use of analgesics with denosumab, then 
analgesic score will be an additional covariate.
