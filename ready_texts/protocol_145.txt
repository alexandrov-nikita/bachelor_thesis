I, the undersigned, am responsible for the conduct of the trial at this site and affirm that:
 I understand and will conduct the trial according to the clinical trial protocol, any approved 
protocol amendments,  ICH Good Clinical Practice (ICH Topic E6 GCP) and all applicable 
Health Authority requirements and national laws.

 I  will not deviate from the clinical trial protocol without prior written permission from the 
Sponsor  and  prior  review  and  written  approval  from  the  Institutional  Review  Board  or 
Independent Ethics Committee, except where necessary to prevent immediate danger to the 
subject.

I understand that some Health Authorities require the Sponsors of clinical trials to obtain and 
supply,  when  required,  details  about  the  Investigators’  ownership  interests  in  the  Sponsor  or 
Investigational Medicinal Product and information regarding any financial ties with the Sponsor. 
The Sponsor will use any such information that is collected solely for the purpose of complying 
with  the  regulatory  requirements.  I  therefore  agree  to  supply  the  Sponsor  with  any  necessary 
information regarding ownership interest and financial ties (including those of my spouse and 
dependent children), and to provide updates as necessary.

 One-, two- and three-year survival.
 Safety.

A  multi-center  phase  III  randomized,  double-blind 
placebo-controlled study in subjects with unresectable 
stage III NSCLC who have demonstrated either stable 
disease  or  objective  response  following  primary 
chemo-radiotherapy 
sequential). 
Subjects  will  be  randomized  2:1  either  to  L-BLP25 
drug  product  (hereinafter  “L-BLP25”)  (investigational 
arm)  or  to  L-BLP25  placebo  (hereinafter  “placebo”), 
respectively. 

(concomitant  or 

Subjects will be stratified by:
 Disease stage (IIIA versus IIIB).
 Response  to  primary  chemo-radiotherapy  (stable 

disease versus objective response).

 Type  of  primary  chemo-radiotherapy  (concomitant 

versus sequential).

 Region  (1:  North  America  [Canada,  United  States] 
and  Australia,  2:  Western  Europe,  or  3:  Rest  of 
World [Mexico, Central and South America, Eastern 
Europe and Asia]). 

Periodic evaluations of the trial data will be conducted 
by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
to ensure subject safety and the validity and scientific 
merit of the study.

Overall,  an  estimated  1476 subjects  (984 on  the 
investigational  arm  and  492 on  the  placebo  arm)  will 
be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 24 months. 
Due to a clinical hold from 19 March 2010 to 14 June 
2010,  all  subjects  randomized during  the  6  months 
(= 26 weeks) prior to the effective start of the clinical 
hold (23 March 2010)  will  be  excluded  from  the 
primary analysis. The primary analysis population will 
encompass an estimated number of 1200 subjects (800
on the investigational arm and 400 on the placebo arm)
in order to achieve the targeted 705 events (deaths) to 
occur in this population.

If the End of Treatment visit is performed earlier than 6 
weeks  after  last  vaccination  (i.e.  due  to  the  start  of 
other  anti-cancer  treatment)  a  follow-up  visit  must  be 
performed 6 weeks after the last vaccination at which 
subjects will be assessed by the investigator for LCSS, 
EQ-5D, treatment site inspection, AEs, documentation 
of post study therapies received and survival. 

12  weeks  after  the  last  vaccination,  a  follow-up  visit 
will be performed in which subjects will be assessed by 
the  investigator  for  LCSS,  EQ-5D,  treatment  site 
inspection,  AEs  related  to  study  drug,  documentation 
of post study therapies received and survival. 

Thereafter every 12 weeks, in the long-term follow-up 
phase, subjects will be assessed by the investigator for 
documentation  of  post  study  therapies  received  and 
survival.  In  addition  a  LCSS  and  EQ-5D  must  be 
completed.  These  long-term  follow-up  visits  can  be 
performed by telephone.

AEs are recorded and assessed continuously throughout 
the study and are assessed for final outcome at the End 
of  Treatment  visit.  However,  AEs  that  are  considered 
to be possibly related to the study drug (including signs 
and symptoms of autoimmune disease) and ongoing at 
the  End  of  Treatment  visit,  must  be  monitored  and 
followed  up  until  the  outcome  is  known.  In  addition 
any AE occurring between the End of Treatment visit 
and  the  follow-up visit  12  weeks  after  the  last 
vaccination, that is considered to be possibly related to 
the study drug must be recorded and followed up until 
outcome is known.

Recording  of  changes  in  concomitant  medication, 
compared to the Pre-Treatment Evaluation visit, as well 
as recording of concurrent procedures during the study, 
starts  after  randomization  and  ends  at  the  End  of 
Treatment visit.

Best  Supportive  Care  (BSC)  will  be  provided  at  the 
investigator’s  discretion  to  both  study  arms  according 
to the institutional standard and may include, but not be 
limited  to,  psychosocial  support,  nutritional  support 
and other supportive therapies. These therapies can be 
administered concomitantly with vaccinations.

TTSP  and  TTP  data  will be  analyzed  using  the  same 
analysis procedures used for the survival endpoint.

The treatment comparison for one-, two- and three-year 
survival will be based on Kaplan-Meier estimation. 

Safety  will  be  summarized  based  on  injection  site 
reactions,  AEs,  vital  signs  and  clinical  laboratory 
assessments.

A  group  sequential  design  is  used  to  compare  the 
overall  survival  in  the  two  study  arms.  Sample  size 
considerations are based on the following assumptions 
and specifications:
 Hazard ratio = 0.77.
 2:1 randomization.
 Alpha = 0.025 (1-sided).
 Power = 90%.
 Two 
formal 

interim  analyses  occurring  after 
observation  of  50%  and  75%  of  the  planned 
maximal  number  of  events in  the  primary  analysis 
population.

 A  final  analysis  after  705  events  have  occurred in 
the  primary  analysis  population  excluding  all 
subjects  randomized  during  the  6  months  prior  to 
the  clinical  hold.  This  is  estimated  to  take  place 
approximately 66 months from trial initiation.

 A  futility  boundary  that  allows  early  stopping 
consistent with the futility boundary of a one-sided 
level 0.025 symmetric group sequential design with 
O’Brien-Fleming boundary relationships.

Under  these  assumptions,  follow-up  will  be  event-

(deaths) in the primary analysis population. Based on a 
median survival of 20 months in the placebo arm and 
considering the true observed accrual rate from start of 
the trial until July 2010 and piecewise uniform accrual 
thereafter, a total of 1476 subjects would be necessary 
in  order  to  ensure  that  the  reduced  primary  analysis 
population encompasses an estimated number of 1200
subjects. This number would project a final analysis at 
approximately  66 months  post  study  initiation.  The 
number  of  1200 subjects evaluable  for  the  primary 
analysis includes an assumed number of approximately 
11% loss to follow-up. Overall, a total number of about 
1476 subjects with 984 subjects on the investigational 
arm  and  492 subjects on  the  placebo  arm will  be 
enrolled. This will lead to 1200 subjects in the primary 
analysis population (800 subjects on the investigational 
arm  and  400 on  the  placebo  arm) to  achieve  the 
specified number of events in the scheduled follow-up 
time in the primary analysis population.

An independent DMC consisting of a group of experts 
will  be  responsible  for  periodic  evaluations  of  the 
clinical trial to ensure continued subject safety as well 
as  the  validity  and  scientific  merit  of  the study.  In 
addition  to  periodic  evaluations  and  a  final  analysis, 
two formal interim analyses are planned.

Introduction

Lung cancer continues to be the most common cancer in the world, both in terms of incidence 
(1.2 million new cases or 12.3% of the world total) and mortality (1.1 million deaths or 17.8% of 
the world total) (2, 3, 4). Worldwide, lung cancer is by far the most common cancer among men 
(17%  of  all  new  cancers  in  2000)  with  the  highest  rates  observed  in  North  America,  Europe 
(especially eastern Europe), South America, and Australia/New Zealand. Moderately high rates 
are also seen in parts of eastern Asia. In less developed regions the highest rates are seen in the 
Middle  East,  China,  the  Caribbean,  South  Africa,  Zimbabwe,  and  the  Pacific.  In  2000,  lung 
cancer was reported to be the number one cancer among men in southern and Eastern Europe, 
Western and southeastern Asia, as well as Micronesia/Polynesia. In females, the incidence rates 
are  much  lower  worldwide  (the  rate  is  11.1  per  100,000  in  women  compared  with  34.9  per 
100,000 in men). The highest estimated  rates are in northwestern Europe and North America, 
where in the year 2000 lung cancer was the fourth most frequent cancer of women. Moderately 
high rates are also seen in Australia, New Zealand and China (2, 3, 4).

In  North  America,  lung  cancer  remains  the  leading  cause  of  cancer  death  for  both  men  and 
women in 2004. Although breast cancer and prostate cancer have the highest incidence rate, lung 
cancer remains the most frequent cause of death from cancer. In 2004, an estimated 21,700 new 
cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in Canada and 173,770 new cases in the United States 
(US). In the same year, an estimated 18,900 deaths are anticipated from lung cancer in Canada 
and 160,440 deaths in the US (5, 6).

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 
about 80% of all cases (7). The majority of NSCLC subjects present with advanced disease at 
diagnosis and a large number of those diagnosed with early stage disease eventually experience 
recurrent disease (8). Chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy have become the standard of care 
for unresectable stage III NSCLC, but even with this aggressive approach the median survival is 
often less than two years with only 15% surviving five years (8). Analyses of phase III trials of 
chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC demonstrate improvements in survival and quality of life, 
although  the  absolute  gains  have  been  small  (9,  10,  11).  Given  the  considerable  toxicity  and 
modest benefit of chemotherapy for NSCLC, it is apparent that additional therapies are required 
to improve the quality of life and survival duration in these patients.

Some subjects may generate a humoral response, but this is not expected since the vaccine was

Rationale  for  Immunotherapy  Including  the  Use  of  Pre-
Treatment Cyclophosphamide

3.3.1

Rationale for Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy  is  the  administration  of  an  immunogenic  substance,  either  alone  or  in  the 
presence  of  an  adjuvant,  to  actively  stimulate  the  immune  system  to  respond  to  a  specific 
antigen.  Immunotherapy  using  novel  cancer  vaccines  is  a  promising  complementary  form  of 
therapy  to  currently  available  therapies.  To  date,  immunotherapy  with  tumor  vaccines  has 
utilized  irradiated  or  mitomycin-C  treated  tumor  cells  as  well  as  mechanically  disrupted  or 
virally lysed tumor cells made from autologous  or allogenic tumor cells. The difficulties with 
these approaches include the lack of reproducible vaccine preparations from whole tumor cells, 
the requirement to validate the removal of viral contaminants and the lack of an adequate supply 
due to the limited availability of tumor tissue. A novel approach to immunotherapy has been the 
development  of  synthetic  tumor-associated  antigens  and  their  formulation  into  vaccine-like 
drugs. The use of synthetic tumor-associated antigens allows for much greater control of vaccine 
manufacture, formulation and testing.

One candidate for development as an immunotherapy agent is the mucinous glycoprotein MUC1 
that has a broad distribution in a variety of normal and abnormal tissues (24, 25). Zotter et al. 
(1988),  noted  that  the  highest  expression  of  MUC1  mucin  occurred  in  cancers  of  the  breast, 
parotid  gland,  stomach,  pancreas,  colon,  prostate,  and  ovary.  It  is  also  highly  expressed  in 
adenocarcinomata of the lung, as well as squamous cell and small cell cancers of the lung, in 
renal cell cancer, and urinary bladder cancer (25).

The MUC1 mucinous glycoprotein has a molecular weight of 450 to 650 kilodaltons and may be 
either secreted or expressed on the cell surface as an integral cell membrane glycoprotein. At the 
molecular level, the MUC1 mucin consists of an integral membrane protein with extracellular, 
transmembrane,  and  cytoplasmic  domains  (29).  Much  of  the  extracellular  domain  of  MUC1 
consists  of  a  characteristic  20  amino  acid  sequence  that  is  repeated  30  to  90  times,  spanning 
some 800 to 1700 amino acids. The recurring amino acid segment is referred to as the tandem 
repeat, the sequence of which has been elucidated (29, 30).

The MUC1 mucin displayed by carcinoma cells is a potential target for use in immunotherapy 
for the following reasons:
 it is aberrantly expressed and upregulated by most carcinomas,
 it is aberrantly glycosylated by carcinomas resulting in the exposure of cryptic epitopes,
 its tandem repeat structure results in there being many antigenic epitopes per molecule,

 its extended structure at the cell surface means it is one of the first molecules immune effector 

cells encounter, and

 its putative ability to elicit human leukocyte-associated antigen (HLA) permissive killing may 

make it applicable to all cancer subjects (31).

A more detailed description of carcinoma-associated mucins, particularly the antigenic potential 
of the MUC1 mucin, is outlined in the IB.
3.3.2

Rationale for Use of Cyclophosphamide

Carcinoma-associated mucins can be highly immunosuppressive. Elevated serum MUC1 mucin 
levels have been shown to correlate with poorer prognosis and immunosuppression of metastatic 
adenocarcinoma subjects (32). High levels of mucins in the blood have been correlated with poor 
prognosis in cancer subjects (32, 33, 34) and in animal models (35, 36). The use of a low dose 
intravenous  (I.V.)  infusion  of  cyclophosphamide  (e.g.  300 mg/m2,  to  a  maximum  of  600  mg) 
may overcome the immune suppression seen in cancer subjects.

Bass and Mastrangelo have reviewed the use of low dose cyclophosphamide with active specific 
immunotherapy in subjects with advanced melanoma and other metastatic cancers, and outlined 
the  basic  scientific  research  that  supports  this  use  (37).  In  various  animal  models, 
cyclophosphamide  demonstrated  its  ability  to  augment  delayed-type  hypersensitivity  (DTH) 
responses, increase antibody production, abrogate tolerance, and potentiate antitumor immunity. 
It is believed that the mechanism of action of cyclophosphamide is the inhibition or reduction in 
the number of the putative suppressor T cells and their precursors. Additionally, MacLean et al. 
have  shown,  in  a  randomized  trial  design,  that  low  dose  I.V.  cyclophosphamide  just  before 
immunotherapy  with  Theratope® (registered  trademark  of  Biomira  Inc.,  Edmonton,  Alberta, 
Canada)  vaccine  was  the  best  route  of  administration  with  respect  to  modulating  the  immune 
system, compared to low dose oral cyclophosphamide given before Theratope® (38, 39). In the 
presence of decreased suppressive immune activity, the development of an effective response to 
the immunogen present in the vaccine may occur.

More details on the rationale for use of cyclophosphamide can be found in the IB.

Safety Results

A summary of observed AEs from the B25-LG-300, B25-LG-302, B25-LG-303, B25-LG-304, 
B25-LG-305  and  B25-PR-501  trials  is  presented  below  in  Table  5–Table  10.  The  safety  data 
presented  here  are  based  on  information  provided  as  of  December  2,  2005  using  Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (40) Preferred Terms. Complete details of the 
updated human safety data can be found in the IB. Abnormal laboratory data were considered to 
be consistent with the subjects’ disease. 

For  three  of  the  clinical  trials,  B25-LG-300,  B25-LG-302,  and  B25-LG-303,  all  data  was 
reviewed  internally  by  members  of  the  clinical  and  data  management  groups,  and  by  the 
respective principle investigator. The data review meetings were not formalized. 

For B25-PR-501, two formal interim and one final data review meeting took place at Biomira.  
The first interim review occurred following enrolment of the first 10 patients, and the second 
following the enrolment of 16 patients.  A final data review meeting occurred after all data was 
available  from  all  patients  at  the  end  of  the  study.  At  each  meeting,  all  available  data  was 
reviewed  by  members  of  the  clinical  and  data  management  teams  and  by  the  principle 
investigators.  

For B25-LG-304, a formal Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was established to evaluate 
patient safety and to ensure the validity and scientific merit of this study.  The DSMB met to 
review  study  data  twice  during  the  course  of  the  trial,  the  first  when  50  and  again  when  100 
patients  completed  the  8  week  evaluation  time  point.  These  data  reviews  were  limited  to  an 
assessment of patient safety  and a review of the assumptions specified in the protocol for the 
sample size determination to assess the appropriateness of the number of patients enrolled and 
the timing of the final analyses.

In  all  the  studies,  the  presence of  erythema  and  induration  in  all  patients  analyzed  to  date  is 
consistent  with  the  occurrence  of  a  DTH  response.  Confirmation,  however,  would  require 
monitoring the timing of the appearance/resolution of the peak response, and determination of 
the cell types present at the sites of the reaction, which was not done.

Preliminary Immunology Results

Immunology  data  have  been  gathered  from  the  B25-LG-300,  B25-LG-302,  B25-LG-303, 
B25-LG-304 and B25-PR-501 clinical trials of L-BLP25.

In the B25-LG-300 study, immunology data from subjects receiving L-BLP25 demonstrated the 
induction of CTLs against HLA matched MUC1 positive tumor cell lines in five out of the 12 
evaluable NSCLC subjects from both arms (20 µg and 200 µg of L-BLP25) of the study. Low 
antibody  responses  were  observed  in  few  patients.  This  result  was  not  unexpected  as  the 
liposomal vaccine is designed to induce a TH1 response, not a humoral immune response (41).

In  the  B25-LG-302  study,  a  MUC1-specific  T  cell  proliferative  response  was  induced  in  6/8 
evaluable subjects receiving the 1,000 µg dose of L-BLP25. The same six subjects were also able 
to  demonstrate  MUC1  specific  expression  of  TNFα  by  their  CD4+  T  cells.  Tumor  necrosis 
factor-α (TNFα) is a cytokine with many biological activities including cytolysis and cytostasis 
of tumor cell lines in vitro. It also has an immunomodulatory effect on neutrophils, macrophages, 
and T cells. There were no CTL responses observed and only low antibody responses were seen.

In  the  B25-LG-303  study,  2/10  subjects  receiving  the  lower  dose  of  L-IL-2  (5  x  105 IU)  had 
MUC1-specific  T  cell  proliferation  with  one  of  the  two  subjects  having  CD4+  T  cells  that 
expressed  TNFα.  Six  of  eight  subjects  receiving  the  higher  dose  of  L-IL-2  (2  x  106 IU)  had 
MUC1  specific  T  cell  proliferation  and  four  of  those  six  subjects  also  had  CD4+  T cells 
expressing TNFα. Only low antibody responses were observed.

In the B25-LG-304 study, of the 88 patients in the L-BLP25 treatment group, 78 were evaluated 
for a T cell proliferative response. Sixteen patients were determined to have a positive MUC1 
specific T cell proliferative response that was induced by L-BLP25. There is a possibility that 
these low numbers are related to technical difficulties in maintaining the viability of lymphocytes 
during collection and transport of samples from the clinical sites.

Results  from  the  B25-PR-501  study,  indicate  that  8/16  patients  (50%)  demonstrated  a  MUC1 
specific T cell proliferative response following L-BLP25 treatments. In addition, T cell receptor 
(TCR)  V repertoire  analysis  was  performed  in  these  patients.  Seven  out  of  16  patients  had 
changes  in  particular  TCRs  after  stimulation.  Most  changes  were  seen  in  CD4+  T cell 
compartment.

within 30 days of receiving L-BLP25, or, in the case of protocol B25-LG-303, within 30 days of 
receiving  L-BLP25 + L-IL-2.  Nine  patient  deaths  were  reported  to  be  due  to  lung  cancer 
progression and one patient death was reported to be due to ventricular fibrillation. All ten deaths 
were  assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to the investigational  agent. For more detail 
please refer to the IB.
3.5.5

Risk/Benefit Assessment

The results from the randomized phase  IIb clinical trial (B25-LG-304) (see Table 12) suggest 
that L-BLP25 has the potential to extend survival of subjects with stage IIIB NSCLC without 
malignant  pleural  effusion  (MPE).  It  is  reasonable  to  believe  that  this  benefit  will  extend  to 
subjects with stage IIIA NSCLC (without MPE) who are ineligible for surgical resection with 
curative intent.

The side effects from treatment with L-BLP25 as shown in the previous trials show a favorable 
safety  profile.  During  conduct  of  this  study,  serious  adverse  events of  possible  autoimmune 
causality have been reported.

Since there is no standard treatment approved for this study population and since no subject is 
being denied BSC in this trial, the anticipated therapeutic and public health benefits from this 
trial justify the risks. The overall efficacy  and safety  findings suggest a favorable  risk-benefit 
ratio of the treatment with L-BLP25, and support the comparison of this treatment with BSC in a 
randomized trial in order to confirm this assumption.

A 2:1 randomization increases the chance of subjects receiving study treatment and at the same 
time maintains the advantages of a placebo-controlled double-blind design.

Study Objectives

Primary objective:
 To compare survival duration of all randomized subjects in the primary analysis population by 

treatment arm.

Secondary objectives of this trial are to compare all randomized subjects in the primary analysis 
population by treatment arm for:
 Time  to  symptom  progression  (TTSP)  as  measured  by  the  Lung  Cancer  Symptom  Scale 

(LCSS).

 Time to progression (TTP) as determined by the investigator.
 One-, two- and three-year survival.
 Safety.

Further variables of interest are:
 Progression Free Survival (PFS).
 Quality of Life (QoL) index (EQ-5D).
 Healthcare resource utilization and work status.
 Additional QoL analyses utilizing the LCSS.
 Time to Treatment Failure (TTF).
 HLA-typing.
 Molecular markers.
 MUC1-specific  immune  response  in  peripheral  blood  will  be  assessed  within  an  ancillary 

clinical trial protocol at a subset of sites. For details see ancillary clinical trial protocol.

Investigational Plan

Overall Study Design and Plan

This  is  an  international,  multi-center,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  randomized,  phase  III 
study in subjects with unresectable stage III NSCLC who have demonstrated either stable disease 
or  objective  response  following  primary  chemo-radiotherapy  (concomitant  or  sequential), 
comparing  survival  duration  in  subjects  treated  with  L-BLP25  versus  subjects  treated  with 
placebo.  

It is planned to conduct this study in approximately 250 centers worldwide (including 42 active 
sites in the USA). In total, 1476 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio: either to L-BLP25 
(investigational  arm)  (984 subjects)  or  to  placebo  (placebo  arm)  (492 subjects),  respectively. 
Subjects  will  be  stratified  by  disease  stage  (IIIA  versus  IIIB),  response  to  primary  chemo-
radiotherapy  (stable  disease  versus  objective  response),  type  of  primary  chemo-radiotherapy 
(concomitant versus sequential), and by region (1: North America [Canada, US] and Australia, 2: 
Western  Europe,  or  3:  Rest  of  World  {ROW}  [Mexico,  Central  and  South  America,  Eastern 
Europe and Asia]). 

To be eligible, subjects entering the trial will have demonstrated either stable disease or objective 
response  (partial  or  complete response)  after  primary  chemo-radiotherapy  (concomitant  or 
sequential).  Stable  disease  or  objective  response  must  be  assessed  according  to  Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) (43). Following a minimum washout period of 4 
weeks (28 days) to a maximum of 12 weeks (84 days), subjects will be randomized in the study.

In order to exclude subjects with metastatic disease it is mandatory to perform a CT-scan of the 
upper abdomen, including liver and adrenal glands, after chemo-radiotherapy. A brain scan (CT-
or  MRI-scan)  must  be  performed  to  exclude  metastases  to  the  brain.  In  case  of  relevant 
symptoms and/or relevant laboratory values, a bone scan must be performed. 

All histological subtypes of NSCLC will be eligible, including bronchioalveolar carcinomas.

Subjects  in  the  investigational  arm  will  receive  a  single  I.V.  infusion  of  300  mg/m2 (to  a 
maximum  of  600  mg)  cyclophosphamide  three  days  before  the  first  L-BLP25  vaccination. 
Subjects  will  then  receive  subcutaneous  vaccinations  for  eight  consecutive  weeks  with 
L-BLP25  (primary  treatment  phase)  followed  by  subcutaneous  vaccinations  with  L-BLP25  at 
6-week  intervals,  commencing  at  week  13  (maintenance  treatment  phase),  until  documented 
disease progression, confirmed by radiological evaluation. Disease progression must be assessed 
according to RECIST.

Subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  will  receive  0.9%  sodium  chloride  (saline)  instead  of 
cyclophosphamide and placebo instead of L-BLP25, both to be administered in the same manner 
as described above for L-BLP25.

Due  to  a  clinical  hold  from  19  March  2010  to  14  June  2010,  treatment  was  stopped  and  no 
further  subjects  could  be  randomized.  Full  global  implementation  of  the  clinical  hold  was

completed  on  23  March  2010.  It  is  believed  that  a  minimum  treatment  of  eight  weekly 
vaccinations and at least two 6-weekly maintenance vaccinations would be necessary to induce 
an  immunotherapeutic  effect  which  could  lead  to  the  hypothesized  prolongation  of  overall 
survival duration. The clinical hold is expected to have a negative impact on the efficacy results 
in subjects who could not be treated according to schedule during the first 26 weeks.

In order to overcome a potentially diluting effect of the clinical hold on the efficacy results, the 
primary  analysis  will  prospectively  exclude  all  275  subjects  randomized  during  the  6  months 
(= 26  weeks)  prior  to  the  effective  start  of  the  clinical  hold,  i.e.  between  22 September  2009
(including) and 22 March 2010 (including). These subjects will be replaced so that enrollment 
will take approximately 56 months from the time the first subject is enrolled until the last subject 
enters the study. Two formal interim analyses are planned occurring after observation of 50% 
and  75%  of  the  planned  maximal  number  of  events  in  the  primary  analysis  population  (705 
deaths), respectively. Final analysis of data is event driven and is expected to be approximately 
66 months post study initiation.

All subjects who discontinue from study treatment will also be followed for survival. Survival 
will  be  monitored  at  12-week  intervals  until  death.  Every  effort  will  be  made  to  ensure  that 
subjects who have disease progression will remain on study for the  evaluation of the primary 
endpoint, overall survival, even though they are off study treatment.

Periodic evaluations of the trial data will be conducted by an independent DMC to ensure subject 
safety and the validity and scientific merit of the study.
Discussion of Study Design

5.2.1

Justification for the Double-Blind Design (Use of Placebo)

With a double-blind design, any differences in ancillary treatment between the two arms will be 
minimized. This design will allow the inference that any difference post-randomization is based 
on clinical outcomes rather than investigator bias. The primary trial endpoint is survival.

To  further  evaluate  the  potential  effect  of  L-BLP25,  the  secondary  endpoints  will  include:  1) 
TTSP using the LCSS questionnaire and 2) TTP as determined by the investigator. A placebo-
controlled  double-blind  design  is  advantageous  for  assessing  these  secondary  endpoints  and 
minimizing the effect of bias and subjectivity on data. 

The placebo is formulated to provide the same carrier lipid matrix as the vaccine, but without the 
monophosphoryl lipid A and the MUC1  BLP25  lipopeptide and therefore should not elicit an 
immune  response  or  have  an  effect  on  survival.  Given  the  mild  local  ISRs  observed  with  L-
BLP25 (only 46 out of 88 patients receiving L-BLP25 experienced an ISR in the B25-LG-304 
study), it is anticipated that any local physiologic response to the placebo will allow the blind to 
be maintained.

An independent DMC will be responsible for periodic evaluations to ensure continued subject 
safety as well as the validity of the study. In addition, two formal interim analysis are planned

5.2.2

Justification for Use of Saline

Subjects  on  the  investigational  arm  receive  cyclophosphamide  prior  to  immunotherapy  in  an 
attempt to overcome the immune suppression seen in cancer subjects, therefore subjects on the 
placebo arm will receive saline in the same calculated dose volume as that of cyclophosphamide 
to maintain the double-blind design.
5.2.3

Justification for Subject Population

Results from the randomized phase IIb clinical trial (B25-LG-304) suggest that L-BLP25 has the 
potential to extend survival of subjects with unresectable stage IIIB NSCLC without MPE. It is 
reasonable to believe that this benefit will extend to subjects with stage IIIA NSCLC who are 
ineligible  for  surgical  resection  with  curative  intent.  This  is  consistent  with  the  theory  that 
immunotherapy  may  be  more  effective  in  subjects  with  a  lower  disease  burden  compared  to 
those with distant metastases.
5.2.4

Justification for Molecular Marker Analysis

Currently, little is known about the biological factors that determine the course of lung cancer. 
Furthermore,  the  factors  that  determine  response  to  immunological  therapy  are  not  well 
understood. It is possible that different responses are partly due to genetic diversity. Therefore, 
the  determination  of  certain  genetic  characteristics  and  the  evaluation  of  response  to  study 
treatment are of major scientific interest to open the opportunity for a personalized treatment for 
patients with lung cancer. 

Evaluation  of  molecular  markers  in  plasma  and  blood  (for  deoxyribonucleic  acid  [DNA], 
ribonucleic  acid  [RNA],  and  protein  analyses)  might  be  useful  in  providing  prognostic 
information with regard to resistance of a tumor to treatment as well as to monitor the effects of 
immunotherapy. Little is known about the biological factors that control response to treatment 
with L-BLP25. The identification of such markers might ultimately facilitate selection of patients 
most  amenable  for  treatment  with  L-BLP25,  thereby  greatly  enhancing  the  success  of  the 
treatment.
5.3

Selection of the Study Population

This is a multi-center study to be conducted at approximately 250 sites worldwide (including 42 
active sites in the USA). Enrollment in this study will be competitive and will continue until at 
least a total of 1476 subjects have entered the study with 984 subjects on the investigational arm 
and 492 subjects on the placebo arm. This will lead to approximately 1200 subjects eligible for 
the primary analysis population (800 subjects on the investigational arm and 400 on the placebo 
arm).

In order to avoid that one of the study centers should dominate the overall result, the maximum 
number of subjects to be randomized per center should not exceed 5% of the total number of 
randomized subjects.

Removal of Subjects from the Study or Study Treatment

5.3.3.1

Subject Discontinuation

Subjects are free to discontinue the study treatment at any time without giving their reason(s).

The subject must be withdrawn from the study treatment in the event of any of the following:
 Withdrawal of the subject’s consent.
 Disease  progression  determined  by  radiological  evaluation.  All  instances  of  clinical 

progression will be confirmed radiologically.

 Occurrence of an exclusion criterion which is clinically relevant and affects subject's safety, if 
discontinuation  of  study  treatment  is  considered  necessary  by  the  investigator  and/or  the 
Sponsor.

 Occurrence of AEs, if discontinuation of study treatment is desired or considered necessary by 

the investigator and/or subject. 

 Occurrence  of  thrombocytopenia  CTCAE  grade  3  or  higher.  Guidance  on  monitoring  of 

special adverse events in Section 7.3.1.4 should be observed.

 Occurrence of transaminase elevation CTCAE grade 3 or higher. Guidance on monitoring of 

special adverse events in Section 7.3.1.4 should be observed.

 Occurrence of any newly emergent diagnosis of autoimmune disease.
 Occurrence of pregnancy.
 Treatment  with  non-permitted  concomitant  drug(s),  as  defined  in Section 6.8,  where  the 
predefined  consequence  is  study  treatment  withdrawal  (the  Sponsor  should  be  contacted  to 
discuss the individual case).

 Determination  by  the  investigator  for  any  reason  that  withdrawal  is  in  the  subject’s  best 

interest.

If  a  subject  misses  two  consecutive  treatments,  continuation  of  study  treatment  will  be 
considered in mutual agreement between the investigator and the Sponsor on case-by case basis.

In case of premature discontinuation of study treatment by a subject, the investigations scheduled 
for the End of Treatment visit should be performed, if possible.  In any case, the Case Report 
Form (CRF) page entitled “End of Treatment” must be completed. After discontinuation of study

treatment all subjects will continue in the follow-up phase of the study, unless the subject refuses 
to (in this case this should be explicitly recorded in the subject’s medical records).

Disease progression must be documented in the subject’s medical record. The date and reason(s) 
for  discontinuation  of  the  subject  from  study  treatment  must  be  documented  in  the  subject’s 
medical records. Subjects who have been discontinued from study treatment will be followed for 
further  anti-cancer  therapies  and  survival  until  death  or  lost  to  follow-up  and  continue  with 
treatment according to institutional standards. Every effort will be made to ensure that subjects 
who have disease progression will remain on study for the evaluation of the primary endpoint, 
overall survival, even though they are off the study treatment. 

If  a  subject  has  failed  to  attend  scheduled  assessments  in  the  study,  the  investigator  must 
determine the reasons and the circumstances as completely and accurately as possible.
5.3.3.2

Study Discontinuation

Study discontinuation is at the discretion of the Sponsor in any of the following events:
 Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study.
 Difficulties in the recruitment of subjects.
 Cancellation of drug development.

In addition, the study may be discontinued at the discretion of the Sponsor and the Coordinating 
Investigator in the event of any or all of the following:
 Inefficacy of the study drug.
 Occurrence of AEs unknown to date in respect of their nature, severity, and duration, or the 

unexpected incidence of known AEs.

Subjects on  active  treatment  at  the  time  of  discontinuation  of  the  trial  may  receive  further 
treatment if the individual is considered to be benefiting from treatment. 

If unforeseen circumstances have prevented the satisfactory progress of the study at a particular 
study site, the investigator or the Sponsor may request the trial be terminated at that study site.

Treatment  Evaluation  visit  at  center  (07)02  in  the  country  with  the  number  07.  Subjects  will 
retain this unique 8-digit number throughout the study

Subject  numbers  will  be  unique  (i.e.  reallocation  of  the  subject  numbers  is  not  permitted). 
Withdrawal  after  randomization  and  before  the  first  treatment  administration  has  to  be 
documented carefully.

Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to either the investigational arm (L-BLP25) or the placebo arm 
following  the  completion  of  all  baseline  evaluations,  determination  of  subject  eligibility,  and 
receipt of informed consent. The randomization will be stratified by disease stage (stage IIIA or 
IIIB),  response  to  primary  chemo-radiotherapy  (stable  disease  or  objective  response),  type  of 
primary chemo-radiotherapy (concomitant or sequential), and region (1: North America [Canada, 
US] and Australia, 2: Western Europe, or 3: ROW [Mexico, Central and South America, Eastern 
Europe  and  Asia]).  The  purpose  of  stratification  is  to  ensure  an  even  distribution  of  subjects 
between the two study arms regarding the strata. 

To randomize a subject, a phone call will be made to the central randomization center using a 24-
hour toll-free number. Randomization will be carried out using the IVRS. The randomization list 
shall be generated under the supervision of the Sponsor. 

Specific  instructions  for  the  assignment  of  subject  identification  numbers  and  the  central 
randomization procedure will be provided in the MOP.
6.3.1

Blinding

The study will be carried out in a double blind design. Investigators and subjects are blind to 
both arms. 

Pre-treatment  with  cyclophosphamide  and  saline  is  blinded  by  a  third  party  preparation 
(designated pharmacist). The medication for the primary and maintenance treatment phase with 
L-BLP25 versus placebo are packaged in identical containers and their appearance is identical. 

With  the  exception  of  a  designated  unblinded  statistician  (see  Section 8.5)  and  IVRS  staff,  as 
well as a designated pharmacist and a study monitor for cyclophosphamide drug accountability 
records, the randomization code will be blind to the Sponsor and other individuals monitoring 
the trial. 

Access to an individual subject’s study arm status may be provided to the investigator in case of 
a medical emergency (see Section 6.3.2).

At the end of the study (see Section 7.7.10), the study sites and those individuals involved with 
monitoring the study will not have access to the treatment assignments until the database for the 
trial is locked and a summary analysis has been presented to the relevant parties.

6.3.2

Procedure for Emergency Code-Breaks

In case of a medical emergency the investigator will be able, if deemed appropriate, to break the 
code for an individual subject to know the identity of the allocated study drug in order to institute 
appropriate  therapeutic  management.  Code-breaking will  be  performed  via  the  IVRS.  In  the 
event that a code-break is performed, the investigator must document the date, time, and reason 
for the code-break. Further details with regard to emergency code breaking will be described in 
the MOP. 

Once a code has been broken, the Sponsor will be automatically notified of this via the IVRS.

To comply with regulatory reporting requirements, the Pharmacovigilance Group of the Sponsor 
will also have procedures in place in order to unblind the code, if required.

Once  the  code  is  broken  for  a  subject,  he/she  will  continue  with  study  treatment  (where 
appropriate). However, in case a subject is withdrawn from study treatment, he/she will continue 
in the follow-up.
6.4

Selection, Timing and Modification of Dose for each Subject

The dosing regimen during the primary L-BLP25 or placebo treatment phase consists of a single 
I.V.  infusion  of  300  mg/m2 of  cyclophosphamide  or  corresponding  volume  of  0.9% sodium 
chloride,  followed  by  eight  consecutive  weekly  subcutaneous  injections  with  L-BLP25  or 
placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The I.V. infusion of cyclophosphamide or placebo has 
to be performed within three days after randomization and three days before the first vaccination. 
The maximum allowable dose of cyclophosphamide is 600 mg. 

It must be documented in the CRF whether the total planned volume of cyclophosphamide or 
placebo was administered, and if this is not the case an estimation must be given in % of the total 
planned volume.

The primary treatment phase consists of eight consecutive weekly subcutaneous injections with 
L-BLP25  or  placebo  at  weeks  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6  and  7.  If  necessary,  deviations  from  the 
vaccination schedule are acceptable as described in Section 7.7.4. 

Subjects  who  complete  the  primary  treatment  phase  may  continue  to  receive  maintenance 
treatment with L-BLP25 or placebo at 6-week intervals, commencing at week 13, until disease 
progression is documented. Deviations from the vaccination schedule are acceptable as described 
in Section 7.7.4.

L-BLP25 or placebo will be supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted 
with 0.6 mL 0.9% sodium chloride in a 5 mL glass vial. 

At  each  vaccination  the content  from  four  vials  (L-BLP25  or  placebo)  is  to  be  injected 
subcutaneously  at  four  different  anatomical  sites.  To  prepare  one  injection  of  L-BLP25  or 
placebo, 0.5 mL of the reconstituted vaccine is withdrawn from the vial and administered to the 
patient. This step is repeated with the remaining three vials. The total volume that is injected at

each vaccination is thus 2.0 mL. The total dose administered at each vaccination to the subject in 
the investigational arm is 806 µg L-BLP25 (as measured by lipopeptide mass) and has a total 
dose volume of 2.0 mL provided in four vials (0.5 mL per vial = 201.5 µg BLP25 lipopeptide). 

L-BLP25  is  intended  for  subcutaneous  administration  and  MUST  NOT be  administered  by 
intravenous  injection.  To  enhance  the  antigenic  stimulation  of  a  greater  number  of  draining 
lymph nodes, the vaccine is to be administered to four anatomical sites. This may increase the 
likelihood of an effective immune response against the disease. The 806 µg dose of L-BLP25 
will consist of four subcutaneous injections each containing one-fourth of the total dose (i.e. 
four  injections  of  each  0.5  mL).  Each  dose  aliquot  will  be  administered  preferentially  in  the 
deltoid  or  triceps  region  of  the  upper  arms,  and  the  left  and  right  anterolateral  aspects  of  the 
abdomen. 

Placebo is to be injected as described for L-BLP25.

Subjects  who  complete  the  primary  treatment  phase  may  continue  to  receive  maintenance 
treatments of 806 μg of L-BLP25 or placebo at 6-week intervals, commencing at week 13, until 
disease progression is documented. Deviations from the vaccination schedule are acceptable as 
described in Section 7.7.4.

Epinephrine, antihistamine, and hydrocortisone should be available for immediate parenteral use 
in the event of an anaphylactic reaction.

The dose of the vaccine should not be modified. If this is deemed necessary by the investigator, 
this must be discussed with the Sponsor in advance. 
6.5

Preparation of the Investigational Product

Instructions  for  the  handling,  preparation  and  administration  of the  investigational  product 
(L-BLP25, placebo, and cyclophosphamide) will be provided in local languages.

In  addition,  further  information  on  the  preparation  and  administration  of  the  investigational 
product can be found in the current IB.
6.6

Packaging and Labeling of the Investigational Product

L-BLP25 and placebo will be packed in blinded fashion in boxes containing a suitable number of 
vials,  together  with  handling  instructions  in  the  local  language  for  the  preparation  and 
administration of the products.

From  the  unique  kit  number on  the  labels  together  with  the  packaging  documentation,  full 
retraceability is given according to the current GMP guidelines.

The information on the medication will be in accordance with approved submission documents. 

Cyclophosphamide will be supplied separately and open-labeled, in boxes containing a suitable 
number of vials, together with handling instructions in the local language for the preparation and

administration  of  the  products. A  designated  pharmacist  at  the  trial  site  will  prepare  both 
cyclophosphamide and saline solution for pre-treatment in such a way that the blind of the trial is 
maintained.

L-BLP25, placebo, and cyclophosphamide will be shipped in validated transport cool containers
(2°C to 8°C) that are monitored with temperature control devices.
6.7

Storage, Issue and Return of the Investigational Product

In this section, IMPs (L-BLP25, placebo, cyclophosphamide) and the control treatment (saline) 
are collectively referred to as “medicinal products”, because there should be no difference to the 
blinded investigator in the preparation, handling, and storage of the blind-labeled products.

Instructions for the preparation, handling, and storage of the medicinal products will be provided 
in local languages. Additional details on the preparation and administration of the IMPs can be 
found in the current IB.

For details regarding storage conditions (e.g. temperature), clean-up procedures and disposal of 
L-BLP25 and cyclophosphamide refer to the MOP. The instructions as given in the MOP need to 
be followed closely.

The IVRS will be used for facilitating the logistics of IMP.

Investigational medicinal products must not be used for any purpose other than the study. The 
administration of IMPs to subjects who have not been enrolled into the study is not covered by 
the study insurance.

Cyclophosphamide is a cytotoxic agent and should be treated accordingly.

The investigator (or the pharmacist or another person who is designated by the investigator) must 
maintain the following inventory records for L-BLP25, placebo, and cyclophosphamide:
 Receipt of treatment boxes at the study center.
 Inventory at the study center.
 Administration to each subject (including medication code numbers).
 Destruction of unused treatment product (unused product will not be returned to the Sponsor).

These  records  will  be  monitored  and  verified  by  the  clinical  study  monitor  as  part  of  routine 
monitoring procedures. 

A  separate  unblinded  monitoring  team  will  make  special  visits  to  monitor  and  reconcile  drug 
accountability for cyclophosphamide and saline drug records.

At the conclusion or termination of this study, site study personnel and the clinical study monitor 
will conduct a final product supply inventory on the Investigational Drug Accountability Forms 
and  all  unused  containers  will  be  destroyed.  Instructions  for  destruction  of  product  will  be 
provided to the site. The clinical study  monitor will be supplied with  a copy  for  filing of the 
Investigational Drug Accountability Forms. This documentation must contain a record of clinical 
supplies used, unused and destroyed and shall include information on:
 All administered units.
 All unused units
 All destroyed units (during the study).
 All destroyed units at the end of the study.
 Date of destruction(s).
 Name and signature of the investigator/pharmacist.

It must be ensured at each study site that the study drug is not used:
 After the expiry date.
 After the retest date unless the study drug is reanalyzed and its retest date extended. 

This is to be closely monitored by the study monitor.

Cyclophosphamide is a cytotoxic agent and should be treated accordingly.
6.8

Prior and Concomitant Therapy

Therapies that are prohibited before study start (lung cancer specific therapies, immunotherapy 
and investigational systemic drugs) are described in Section 5.3.2.

Any additional concomitant therapy that becomes necessary during the study and any changes in 
concomitant drug must be recorded in the corresponding section of the CRF, noting drug, dose, 
duration,  and  indication.  If  during  the  clinical  study  the  administration  of  a  non-permitted 
concomitant drug becomes necessary, e.g. because of AE(s), the investigator should try to first 
discuss  this  with  the  Sponsor  to  decide  whether  the  subject  in  this  case  can  continue  study 
treatment  or  not.  Of  course,  in  case  of  an  emergency  any  appropriate  therapy  to  treat  the 
emergency should be administered

Prevention of nausea or vomiting associated with pre-treatment cyclophosphamide/saline should 
preferably  be  attempted  by  use  of  antiemetics  such  as  granisetron,  metoclopramide, 
prochlorperazine, thiethylperazine, domperidone or ondansetron. Due to the immunosuppressive 
effects of corticosteroids, these compounds should only be used as second choice for prevention 
of nausea and vomiting.

Subjects  must  not  receive  any  therapies  intended  to  modulate  the  immune  system  (other  than 
treatment.

Physical Examination and Vital Signs 

A physical examination will be conducted (see Section 7.3.3.1).

Vital signs (weight, height, body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure) will 
be assessed at the Pre-Treatment Evaluation visit, at week 4, 8, 19 and every 12 weeks thereafter 
and at the End of Treatment visit and recorded in the CRF. For further assessments of vital signs 
see Section 7.3.3.2.
7.1.6

Electro Cardiogram

A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed at the Pre-Treatment Evaluation visit and at the End 
of Treatment visit. The date and outcome of the ECG will be documented in the CRF.
7.1.7

Imaging

Imaging (CT- or MRI- scan) of the chest will be performed to document the baseline status of 
the tumor disease no longer than 28 days before randomization. The same radiological evaluation 
methods used prior to primary chemo-radiotherapy should be used with the exception that PET-
scan does not need to be repeated even if it was part of the initial radiological evaluation prior to 
primary chemo-radiotherapy.

If imaging after primary chemo-radiotherapy was earlier than 4 weeks prior to randomization, it 
must be repeated within 4 weeks prior to randomization, and the results of the second restaging 
after end of primary chemo-radiotherapy must be compared with the first restaging after end of 
primary chemo-radiotherapy. Subjects that show progression between these two assessments are 
not eligible for this trial. 

In order to exclude subjects with metastatic disease it is mandatory to perform a CT-scan of the 
upper abdomen, including liver and adrenal glands, after chemo-radiotherapy. A brain scan (CT-
or MRI-scan) must be performed to exclude metastasis to the brain. In case of relevant symptoms 
and/or relevant laboratory values, a bone scan must be performed.

During  study  treatment,  imaging  studies  should  be  performed  according  to  local  hospital 
standards. For all imaging studies performed, the technique, date of imaging and outcome will be 
recorded in the CRF. The date of progression of disease (if applicable) will also be recorded in 
the  CRF  (at  the  End  of  Treatment  visit).  In  addition  the  pattern  type  of  progression  will  be 
documented in the CRF.

Assessment of pre-study stable disease or objectives response as well as on-study progression of 
disease should be assessed according to RECIST.
7.1.8

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

Blood samples will be taken at the local laboratory for safety laboratory evaluations (hematology 
and biochemistry) (see Section 7.3.4) and sent to a central laboratory for analysis. The date of 
blood sampling must be recorded in the CRF.

mandatory since they serve to assess the safety of the study medication. 
7.1.9

Plasma and Whole Blood Collection

Plasma  and  whole  blood  samples  will  be  collected  for  the  identification  of  novel  molecular 
marker profiles as surrogates of response to immunotherapy. 

For this purpose plasma (10 mL, requiring 20 mL of blood) and whole blood (8.5 mL) samples 
will be collected at the Pre-Treatment Evaluation visit, at the Primary Treatment Evaluation visit 
and at visit 13 (i.e. week 19) or the End of Treatment visit, whichever comes first.

The date of plasma and whole blood sampling will be recorded in the CRF. 

Details of associated procedures will be described in the MOP.
7.1.10

Human Leukocyte-Associated Antigen Typing

An additional blood sample (5 mL) will be collected at the Pre-Treatment Evaluation visit for 
HLA typing. 

The date of blood sampling will be recorded in the CRF.

Details of associated procedures will be described in the MOP.
7.1.11

Pregnancy Testing and Contraception

All female subjects of childbearing potential must have  a negative pregnancy test  at baseline. 
Date and outcome of the pregnancy test must be recorded in the CRF. Pregnancy testing must be 
repeated regularly throughout the study if required by local legislation. All subjects – male and 
female – must practice medically accepted contraception throughout the study.

Survival

Subject death will be reported by the investigator and documented in the CRF.

Lung Cancer Symptom Scale 

The  LCSS  is  a  validated  questionnaire  (consisting  of  a  subject  scale  [APPENDIX  D]  and  an 
observer  scale  [APPENDIX  E])  used  to  specifically  measure  symptom  changes  relevant  to 
quality of life for individuals undergoing treatment for lung cancer (44, 45) and is used as a tool 
to determine TTSP. The 9-question tool (APPENDIX D) is used to document subject-reported 
outcomes for a variety of lung cancer associated symptoms. The data derived provides a level of 
detail in determining clinical benefit that is unavailable from the review of other endpoints.

START

The  average  symptomatic  burden  index  (ASBI)  will  be  used  to  determine  differences  in  the 
treatment groups. The ASBI is the mean of all six symptom scores (subject scale of the LCSS) 
treated as a single domain. 

Only centers where a validated local language version of the subject scale of the questionnaire is 
available, will take part in the LCSS assessments.

Questionnaires will be handed to the subject and should be completed at the investigational site 
prior to the initiation of any other study activities or treatments (including laboratory draws and 
study treatment administration) and prior to any contact with the investigator. The observer scale 
of  the  questionnaire  will  be  completed  by  the  investigator  according  to  the  same  schedule 
followed by the subject. Efforts should be made at the investigational site (e.g. by nominating a 
nurse)  to  ensure  that  a  fully  completed  questionnaire  is  obtained  from  every  subject  at  each 
scheduled time point.

Subjects will be asked to fill in the questionnaires as completely and accurately as possible. The 
subject  must  complete  the  instruments  with  no  assistance  from family/friends,  although  the 
investigator’s staff may provide limited assistance, if necessary.

The LCSS tool will be administered at the Pre-Treatment Evaluation visit and at weeks 2, 5, and 
8 (during the primary treatment phase). Subsequent administrations of the LCSS will occur every 
6 weeks at the scheduled vaccination visits commencing at week 13 until disease progression and 
at  the  End  of  Treatment  visit.  At  6  and  12  weeks  following  the  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment, the LCSS will be administered by the investigator or designee during the follow-up 
visits. Both the subject and observer scales will be administered at each of these visits. In case 
the subject scale is not completed, the observer scale must still be completed. After this time, 
telephone  reminders  by  the  investigator  or  designee  to  the  subject  to  complete  and  mail  the 
LCSS form will occur every 12 weeks until study end or death (subject scale only).
7.2.3
Time to Progression as Determined by Investigator

It is recognized that the standard approach of determining TTP generally requires frequent serial 
radiological  imaging  of  subjects.  In  this  trial,  TTP  will  be  determined  by  the  investigator 
according to institutional standards, meaning that the technique and timing of imaging studies is 
done according to hospital standards. RECIST criteria should be used for the determination of 
progression of disease. This approach allows a “real world” aspect to be used for patient care. 
Signs  of  clinical  progression  will  be  confirmed  radiologically  whenever  possible  and 
documented in the CRF. The double blind nature of the trial will minimize potential bias.

Assessment of Safety

Adverse Events

Definition  of  Adverse  Event,  Adverse  Drug  Reaction  and 
Serious Adverse Event

Adverse Event (AE):

Any  untoward  medical  occurrence  in  a  patient or  clinical  investigation  subject  administered  a 
pharmaceutical  product  and  which  does  not  necessarily  have  a  causal  relationship  with  this 
treatment. 

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding,  for  example),  symptom,  or  disease  temporally  associated  with  the  use  of  a  medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

The  official  definition  also  extends  to  AEs  occurring  under  placebo  or  in  a  reference  group 
receiving drug or non-drug therapy. Because of regulatory requirements, events occurring during 
drug-free  and  pre- and  post-treatment  periods  should  also  be  designated  as  AEs.  Therefore, 
safety surveillance (reporting of (S)AEs) commences at the time when the subject is enrolled into 
the study (date of signature of the informed consent) until the End of Treatment visit has been 
performed. This procedure complies  with requirements by some authorities and  requests  from 
the subjects’ insurance carrier (not applicable in the USA).

Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR):

In  the  pre-approval  clinical  experience  with  a  new  medicinal  product  or  its  new  usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established:
 all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to  any dose should be 

considered ADRs.

The  phrase  “responses  to  a  medicinal  product”  means  that  a  causal  relationship  between  a 
medicinal product and an AE is a reasonable possibility.

Serious Adverse Event (SAE):

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
 results in death,
 is life-threatening, 

NOTE: The term ”life-threatening” in the definition of ”serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

EMR 63325 - 001

START

 requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These may be 
considered serious adverse drug experiences. 

Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room, or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm;  blood  dyscrasias  or  convulsions  that  do  not  result  in  hospitalization;  or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

SAEs are a subset of AEs which meet the regulatory criteria for events that are considered to be 
serious. Hospitalization is not per definition an SAE; rather the event that caused the subject to 
be hospitalized is the SAE. 

Events not treated as SAEs:

Progression  of  underlying  disease  (i.e.  NSCLC)  is  not  an  AE;  therefore,  it  is  not  an  SAE. 
However,  signs  and  symptoms  of  disease  (tumor)  progression,  such  as  dyspnea,  tumor  pain, 
bleeding, etc., may meet a criterion of an SAE and, if so, should be reported as such.

Death per se is an outcome and not regarded as an SAE. The primary cause of death (the event 
leading to death) should be recorded and  reported as an SAE. “Died”  will be recorded  as the 
outcome  of  the  respective  event.  In  case  that  no  cause  of  death  can  be  reported  (e.g.  sudden 
death, unexplained death), the death per se might be reported as an SAE.

Handling of elective hospitalizations: Elective hospitalization for treatment of underlying disease 
or to simplify study treatment or study procedures is not considered as AEs/SAEs. Independent 
of this definition all hospitalizations have to be reported in the CRF.

Other events to be treated as SAEs:

Exposure to drug during pregnancy/lactation:

In  principle,  pregnancy  and  the  lactation  period  are  exclusion  criteria.  In  the  event  of  a 
pregnancy  occurring  during  the  course  of  a  study,  the  subject  must  be  withdrawn  from  study 
drug immediately. The Sponsor must be notified without delay and the subject followed during 
the entire course of the pregnancy and postpartum period. Parental and neonatal outcomes must 
be recorded even if they are completely normal and without AEs. The “Alert Report Form on 
Serious Adverse Events" (ARF) (initial or follow-up) should be used, even though pregnancy is 
not  considered  a  SAE.  No  “serious  criterion”  should  be  checked.  The  ARF  is  solely  used  to 
ensure expedited reporting.

AEs due to special safety issues of the study drug: 

ISRs have been observed in previous studies of this vaccine. Severe reactions (according to the 
National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Toxicity  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  [NCI  CTCAE]  v3.0) 
should be reported immediately using the Alert Report Form.

Thrombocytopenia
Occurrence of thrombocytopenia CTCAE grade 3 or higher should be classified as an SAE and 
be  reported  as  such  by  the  investigator.  Please  also  note  subject  discontinuation  criteria  in 
Section 5.3.3.1.

Hepatic dysfunction
Occurrence of transaminase elevation CTCAE grade 3 or higher should be classified as an SAE 
and be reported as such by the investigator. Please also note subject discontinuation criteria in 
Section 5.3.3.1.

Autoimmune disease
Newly identified autoimmune disease should be classified as an SAE and be reported as such by 
the investigator. Please also note subject discontinuation criteria in Section 5.3.3.1.
7.3.1.2

Methods of Recording and Assessing Adverse Events

There will be a written procedure to explain the reporting structure for AEs among the CRO and 
the Sponsor. The investigator and study staff will be supplied with all necessary instructions and 
forms.

Subjects will be asked to report all AEs as part of the procedures performed at each study visit. 
Specific inquiry will be made about the condition of treatment sites (to determine if an injection 
site reaction [ISR] has occurred). During visits, previous sites of injection will be monitored for 
the  appearance  of  subcutaneous  nodules,  skin  ulcerations,  or  signs  of  any  other  ISRs.  Site 
personnel will document all AEs in the subject's medical record. All AEs (including ISRs) must 
be documented in the appropriate section of the CRF. Among these AEs, all serious AEs must be 
additionally documented in the ARF (initial or follow-up). Ensure that all AEs are documented 
appropriately (as described below).

The following aspects must be recorded for each event in the CRF:
 a description of the AE in medical terms, not as reported by subject,
 the date of onset (start date),
 the date of recovery (stop date),
 the time of onset in relationship to administration of the investigational product,
 the severity  of the sign  and/or symptom or clinically  significant  abnormal laboratory value 
according to NCI CTCAE v3.0. If no toxicity grade is described for a given sign, symptom or

abnormal laboratory value, the investigator will grade the severity as mild (1), moderate (2), 
severe (3), or life-threatening or disabling (4),

 the causal relationship to the investigational product as assessed by the investigator. One of 
the  decisive  factors  in  the  decision  is  the  temporal  relation  between  the  AE and  the 
administration of the vaccine. The investigator must decide if there is a reasonable possibility 
that the investigational  product was the  cause (etiology) of the AE. The question: “  Is this 
adverse  event  suspected  to  be  reasonably  related  to  the  investigational  product?”  will  be 
answered “NO (not related)” or “YES (related)”,

 action taken on study drug:

 no change,
 temporary discontinuation,
 permanent discontinuation,

 other actions:

 none,
 corrective treatment,
 hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization,
 other,

 the outcome according to the following definitions:

 recovered/resolved (AE disappeared),
 recovering/resolving (subject is recovering),
 not recovered/not resolved (AE remains without signs of improvement),
 recovered/resolved with sequelae (AE has resulted in permanent disability/incapacity),
 change in toxicity grade,
 fatal,
 unknown (only applicable if subject has been lost to follow-up),

 seriousness: YES or NO,

NOTE: If this question is answered “YES” the corresponding serious criteria must be ticked:
 subject died,
 life-threatening,
 hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization,
 persistent/significant disability,
 congenital abnormality,
 important medical event.

If in any one subject the same AEs occur on several occasions, then the AE in question must be 
documented and assessed anew each time.

Only abnormal laboratory values that are deemed clinically significant by the investigator will be 
documented in the AE section of the CRF. Any laboratory parameters that are outside the normal 
range and are significantly different from the baseline values will be followed up as necessary 
until the abnormality has been resolved or the etiology clarified to the investigator’s satisfaction.
7.3.1.3

Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events

In the event of the occurrence of any clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious 
or medically important during the course of the study or the post-treatment period, irrespective of 
the  treatment  received  by  the  subject,  the  investigator  is  obliged  to  immediately  inform  the 
Sponsor’s designated safety  desk,  either by  telephone or by  fax using the contact information 
provided to each investigator. Such report should be made within 24 hours of awareness of the 
event(s).

All SAEs of thrombocytopenia and transaminases elevations, irrespective of relationship to study 
treatment, will be reported to health authorities in an expedited manner.

For  names,  addresses,  telephone  and  fax  numbers  see  the  ARF  specific  for  each  participating 
country.

Following a report by phone, written information has to be sent by fax. For written reports, the 
form "Alert Report on Serious Adverse Events (SAE)" must be used. 

As a principle, the SAE must be documented and medically assessed by the Investigator and the 
outcome described on the ARF and in the AE section of the CRF. The ARF includes the AE 
CRF as an integral part of the form. The AE data (Section 7.3.1.2) are entered on the AE CRF 
and  the  page  is  to  be  copied  and  transmitted  with  the  rest  of  the  ARF.  The  ARF  should  also 
include,  if  relevant,  other  pages  from  the  CRF,  e.g.  medical  history  and  concomitant 
medications.

Additional  information  will  be  requested,  if  necessary,  by  the  responsible  monitor.  This  is  to 
ensure  that  the  initial  reporting  of  SAEs  is  made  to  regulatory  authorities  within  the  required 
timeframe. The Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Group will have procedures in place to if required 
by  reporting  obligations  unblind  the  randomization  code  in  order  to  comply  with  regulatory 
reporting requirement.

For  a  follow-up  report  to  the  authorities,  the  monitor  may  be  required  to  collect  further 
information  for  a  detailed  description  and  a  final  evaluation  of  the  case,  including  copies  of 
hospital reports, autopsy reports, or other relevant documents. The Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Group  reserves  the  right  to  contact  the  investigator  directly  if  an  incomplete  or  inconsistent 
report is affecting the regulatory timelines.

Monitoring of Subjects with Adverse Events

AEs  are  recorded  and  assessed  continuously  throughout  the  study  (starting  after  the  subject 
signed  informed  consent)  and  are  assessed  for  final  outcome  at  the  End  of  Treatment  visit. 
However, AEs that are considered to be possibly related to the study drug (including signs and 
symptoms of autoimmune disease) and ongoing at the End of Treatment visit must be monitored 
and followed up until the outcome is known. There must be documented reasonable attempts to 
get this information.

In  addition  any  AE  occurring  between  the  End  of  Treatment  visit  and  the  follow-up  visit  12 
weeks after last vaccination, that is considered to be possibly related to the study drug must be 
recorded and followed up until outcome is known.

During  follow-up  visits,  previous  sites  of  injection  will  be  monitored  for  the  appearance  of 
subcutaneous nodules, skin ulceration, or signs of any other ISRs.

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  investigator  to  ensure  that  any  necessary  additional  therapeutic 
measures and follow-up procedures are performed. 

Monitoring of special adverse events

Thrombocytopenia:
a) In  case  of  a  confirmed  grade  1  thrombocytopenia  (CTCAE v3.0)  in  combination  with  a 
decrease in platelets by ≥ 40 x 109/L, monitoring intervals for platelets should be shortened to 
at least every 2 weeks. Re-testing may be done by any local lab if the investigator is informed 
about results without delay.

b) In case of a confirmed grade 2 thrombocytopenia (CTCAE v3.0) (platelets < 75 x 109/L and 
≥ 50 x 109/L),  investigational  treatment  should  be  temporarily  suspended,  and  laboratory 
monitoring frequency should be increased to at least every 2 weeks. Re-testing may be done 
by  any  local  lab  if  the  investigator  is  informed  about  results  without  delay.  Relevant 
additional tests should be initiated to closely monitor the course of any such abnormalities and 
to determine the etiology. Consultancy by a hematologist should be obtained. Treatment may 
be  restarted  upon  improvement  to  grade  1  or  0  thrombocytopenia  and  clearance  by  a

permanent discontinuation of study treatment.

c) In case of a confirmed grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia (CTCAE v3.0) (platelets < 50 x 109/L), 
investigational treatment will be discontinued immediately. Frequent monitoring according to 
local standards and relevant additional tests should be initiated to closely monitor the course 
of  any  such  abnormalities  and  to  determine  the  etiology.  Consultancy  by  a  hematologist 
should be obtained.

Hepatic dysfunction:

In case of elevation of transminases to grade 2 (> 2.5 – 5 x ULN) or elevation of total bilirubin to 
grade  2  (> 1.5 – 3 x ULN),  tests  should  be  repeated  within  2–3  days  including  at  least  ALT, 
AST, ALP, INR and total bilirubin. Re-testing may be done by any local lab if the investigator is 
informed  about  results  without  delay.  Treatment  should  be  temporarily  discontinued.  Further 
monitoring  intervals  should  be  at  least  weekly  including  total  bilirubin,  ALP  and  INR. 
Additional  tests  as  well  as  taking  of  relevant  history  should  be  performed  to  determine  the 
etiology of these abnormalities. Additional tests should include those for infectious, cholestatic 
obstructive, alternative pharmacologic, toxic, hypoxic/ ischemic and autoimmune causes. 

In the following cases treatment should be discontinued:
 increase of transaminases to CTCAE grade ≥ 3 (> 5 – 20 x ULN) 
 increase of transaminases > 3-fold ULN and concomitant increase of either total bilirubin to 

> 2-fold ULN or INR > 1.5

 increase of transaminases > 3-fold ULN and new appearance or worsening of fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia > 
5%

In such cases close monitoring as described above for grade 2 elevation of liver test parameters 
should be implemented and a hepatologist consult be obtained.

Treatment  may  only  be  restarted  upon  improvement  to  grade  1  or  0  and  clearance  by  a 
hepatologist or in case of a clear alternative explanation not related to investigational treatment. 
In case of worsening of transaminases and/or bilirubin upon re-exposure to the investigational 
treatment subjects must be permanently discontinued.

For  subjects  with  suspected  or  confirmed  newly  autoimmune  disease,  please  refer  to 
Section 7.3.2.

Overdose and Intoxication with the Study Drug

The risk of overdose or intoxication with this investigational product is assessed as low because 
it  will  be  administered  in  the  clinic  by  trained  medical  personnel.  L-BLP25  is  designed  for 
subcutaneous injection. There are no data available for effects when L-BLP25 is administered 
via other routes of administration. There is no known antidote.

Special Precautions

As  with  any  type  of  injection,  epinephrine,  antihistamine  and  hydrocortisone,  should  be  a 
available for immediate parenteral use in the event of an anaphylactic reaction. 

MUC1  antigen  is  broadly  distributed  in  a  variety  of  normal  and  neoplastic  tissues.  There  is, 
therefore,  the  possibility  that  administration  of  L-BLP25  to  subjects  may  result  in  the

development of an autoimmune response. Special attention should therefore be paid to signs and 
symptoms that may indicate an autoimmune disorder. 

During  the  clinical  development  of  L-BLP25,  events  with  a  possible  autoimmune  origin  have 
been  reported.  These  include  fatal  cases  of  encephalitis,  thrombocytopenia,  and  hepatic 
dysfunction which have been assessed as possibly related to L-BLP25. 

If  a  subjects  presents  with  signs  suspicious  of  encephalitis  or  other  neuroinflammatory 
conditions,  an  expert  neurological  opinion  must  be  obtained.  Investigational  treatment  will  be 
discontinued immediately upon diagnosis of encephalitis or other neuroinflammatory conditions
and the subject monitored with respect to this condition and any emergent symptoms or diseases 
deemed  to  be  related.  The  neurologist  has  to  initiate  appropriate  imaging,  viral  serology,  and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigation according to best practice. 

With regards to imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed in such cases. 
Acquisitions should include T1 sequences both pre- and post- contrast plus diffusion weighted 
T1 sequences, as well as T2, T2* (T2 star) and T2 FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) 
sequences. Generally, the imaging protocol used at the imaging site will be acceptable, but in 
case of clinical or technical issues or unavailability of the necessary service within reasonable 
time,  the  sponsor  or  delegate  should  be  contacted.  Where  available,  magnetic  resonance 
spectroscopy  should  also  be  considered.  Imaging  data  should  be  available  for  transfer  to  the 
sponsor or its authorized agent or the regulatory authorities upon request. Details are provided 
within a contingency imaging  guideline manual. Further imaging studies should be applied as 
appropriate.

In  addition,  in  case  of  suspected  encephalitis  or  other  neuroinflammatory  conditions,  a  CSF 
sample for further diagnostic evaluation should be collected and stored frozen at –80°C at the 
site, if possible.

Furthermore, subjects should be informed by the investigator about potential symptoms related 
to:
 thrombocytopenia: such as frequent bruising, epistaxis or petechiae
 neurological  disorders:  such  as  double  vision,  loss  of  memory,  personality  changes, 

impairment of speech or limb weakness

 hepatic  dysfunction:  such  as  jaundice,  yellow  sclerae,  concomitant  itching,  light  colored 

stools, or dark urine 

Subjects will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately upon occurrence of any such 
symptoms.

Monitoring of special adverse events is further described in Section 7.3.1.4.

A single  I.V. infusion of cyclophosphamide or saline will be given three days before the first 
vaccination. Before the infusion the BSA must be calculated and recorded in the CRF (including 
the  weight  and  date  weight  was  taken).  It  must  be  documented  in  the  CRF  whether  the  total 
planned volume was administered, and if this is not the case an estimation must be given in % of 
the total planned volume. 

Eight weekly subcutaneous vaccinations with L-BLP25 or placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 
7  (primary  treatment  phase)  will  be  administered.  Thereafter,  maintenance  vaccinations 
(L-BLP25 or placebo) will be administered, commencing at week 13, until disease progression is 
documented (maintenance treatment phase).

At all vaccination visits the following will be documented and recorded in the CRF:
 number of injections (if not all injections were administered as planned, an explanation must 

be given) and injection sites (anatomical sites).

 time of injection.

At  all  vaccination  visits,  vital  signs  (body  temperature,  respiratory  rate, heart  rate  and  blood 
pressure) will be monitored and recorded in the CRF: 
 Monitoring of vital signs before and for 1 hour after each injection in the primary treatment 

phase (and recording in CRF before and 1 hour after injections).

 Monitoring of vital signs before and for 30 minutes after each injection in the maintenance 

treatment phase (and recording in CRF before and 30 minutes after injections).

Plasma and Whole Blood

Plasma  and  whole  blood  samples  represent  a  good  source  for  the  identification  of  novel 
molecular  marker  profiles  as  surrogates  of  response  to  immunotherapy.  It  is  planned  to  assay 
plasma and blood samples for potential markers with regard to NSCLC and immunotherapy for 
the identification of outcome markers depending on availability of new technology in the future.

Possible approaches for identifying putative molecular markers for immunotherapy are:
 Detection of a humoral response (e.g. to the molecular target of L-BLP25 or to components of 

L-BLP25 by use of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay [ELISA]).
 Determination of cytokines that are linked to immunological functions.
 Detection of soluble tumor markers (e.g. soluble MUC1).
 Determination of circulating residual tumor cells.
 Detection of changes in soluble mediators of immune effects.
 Determination of polymorphisms in cellular components of the immune system (e.g. receptors

on natural killer cells).

 Identification and monitoring of immunological markers by use of microarrays.

All  of  the  above  mentioned  investigations  would  be  entirely  explorative  in  this  study.  These 
biological  samples  and  data  will  be  dealt  with  in  strict  confidentiality  as  for  any  other  data 
collected during the clinical trial. Any research performed on these samples will only be initiated 
in  accordance  with  the  current  regulations.  DNA  analyses  will  be  restricted  to  the  single 
candidate  genes  associated  with  immunological  effector  functions.  No  genome-wide  analyses 
will be performed on extracted DNA samples from blood.

In addition to these potential analyses, additional blood samples will be drawn at selected sites 
participating  in  an  Ancillary  Clinical  Trial  Protocol  in  order  to  assess  the  MUC1-specific 
immune response. Further details will be provided in the Ancillary Clinical Trial Protocol.

The results of any analyses on molecular markers are dealt with in such a way that the blind is 
kept.

Quality of Life Index (EQ-5D)

The EQ-5D questionnaire (APPENDIX F) is a generic measure of health status that provides a 
simple descriptive profile and a simple index value that can be used in the clinical evaluation of 
health  care.  The  EQ-5D  defines  health  in  terms  of  mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. In addition a visual analogue scale is used to describe 
the subjects’ health state on the day of assessment (46, 47).

For those countries where a validated version of the EQ-5D does not exist, EQ-5D should not be 
used.

The  EQ-5D  questionnaire  will  be  completed  at  the  following  visits:  pre-treatment  evaluation 
visit, week 2, week 5 and week 8. Subsequent administrations of the EQ-5D will occur every 6 
weeks during the scheduled vaccination visits commencing at week 13 and continuing till the 
End of Treatment visit. At 6 and 12 weeks following the discontinuation of study treatment (i.e. 
last  vaccination),  the  EQ-5D  will  be  administered  by  the  investigator  or  designee  during  the 
follow-up visits. The questionnaire will be handed to the subject and should be completed at the 
investigational site prior to the initiation of any  other study  activities or  treatments (including 
laboratory  draws  and  study  treatment  administration)  and  prior  to  any  investigation  by  the 
investigator. After this time, telephone reminders by the investigator or a designee to the subject 
to complete and mail the questionnaire will occur every 12 weeks until study end or death.

Treatment Evaluation

Vital signs and inspection of treatment sites will be performed before each injection and will be 
monitored  for  1  hour  after  each  weekly  injection  and  30  minutes  after  each  maintenance 
injection.  Information  on  any  ISRs  will  be  obtained  through  observations  and  interview  with 
subjects. 

All  subjects  will  have  blood  drawn  for  hematology  and  biochemistry/transaminase/bilirubin
analyses at weeks 4, 8, 13 and every 6 weeks thereafter and at the End of Treatment visit. During 
the  maintenance  treatment  phase,  transaminases/bilirubin  assessments  will  be  alternated  with 
biochemistry assessments, which also include assessment of transaminases/bilirubin.

Physical examinations (including vital signs) will be performed at weeks 4, 8, 13 and every 6 
weeks  thereafter  and  at  the  End  of  Treatment  visit. During  the  maintenance  treatment  phase, 
neurological  examinations  will  be  alternated  with  full  physical  examinations  including 
neurological examinations.

LCSS assessments will  be performed at weeks  2, 5, and 8. Subsequent  administrations of the 
LCSS will occur every 6 weeks during the scheduled vaccination visits, commencing at week 13
until  disease  progression  and  at  the  End  of  Treatment  visit.  At  6  and  12 weeks  following  the 
discontinuation of study treatment (i.e. last vaccination), the LCSS will be administered by the 
investigator or designee during the follow-up visits. Both the subject and observer scales will be 
administered at each of these visits. After this time, telephone reminders by the investigator or 
designee  to  the  subject  to  complete  and  mail  the  form  will  occur  every  12 weeks  (long  term 
follow-up) until study end or death (subject scale only).

EQ-5D assessments will be performed at weeks 2, 5 and 8. Subsequent administrations of the 
EQ-5D assessment will occur every 6 weeks during the scheduled vaccination visits until disease 
progression and at the End of Treatment visit. At 6 and 12 weeks following the discontinuation 
of study treatment (i.e. last vaccination), the EQ-5D will be administered by the investigator or 
designee during the follow-up visits. After this time, telephone reminders by the investigator or 
designee  to  the  subject  to  complete  and  mail  the  form  will  occur  every  12 weeks  (long  term 
follow-up) until study end or death.

AEs will be captured for as long as the subjects remain on study treatment, and up to the End of 
Treatment  visit  (or  up  to  the  first  follow-up  visit  if  the  End  of  Treatment  visit  is  performed 
earlier than 6 weeks after the last vaccination).  All newly-diagnosed or  worsening conditions, 
signs and symptoms observed since baseline, whether related to study treatments or not, are to be 
reported as AEs. 

At the End of Treatment visit, AEs are assessed for final outcome. However, all AEs that are 
considered  to  be  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug  (including  signs  and  symptoms  of 
autoimmune disease) and ongoing at the End of Treatment visit must be monitored and followed 
up until the outcome is known. In addition any AE occurring between the End of Treatment visit 
and the follow-up visit 12 weeks after last vaccination, that is considered to be possibly related to 
the study drug must be recorded and followed up until outcome is known.

Long-term follow-up visits can be performed by phone.  Information on  post-therapies  will be 
collected through review of medical records or request from primary-care physician’s office and 
the subjects will be contacted by phone to attain the survival status. 

Subjects not known to be deceased will be censored at the date last known alive or lost to follow-
up. Every effort will be made to ensure that subjects who have disease progression will remain 
on study for the evaluation of the primary endpoint, overall survival, even though they are off the 
study treatment.

Changes to the Schedule of Visits and Assessments Following 
Unblinding of the Trial 

7.7.9.1

Subjects Randomized to the Placebo Arm

For subjects who are on ongoing placebo treatment at the time of unblinding of the trial, the End
of Treatment visit will be performed 6 weeks after the last placebo vaccination and subjects will 
enter  the  visit  and  assessment  schedule  of  the  follow-up  and  long-term  follow-up  visits  as 
described. 

In  addition to  the  long-term  follow-up  schedule,  AEs  will  be  assessed  every  6  weeks  until 
disease progression. Six-weekly assessments of AEs may be performed by phone.

Cross-over to active treatment with L-BLP25 is not foreseen for subjects on the placebo arm in 
order to allow for an unbiased follow-up of efficacy and safety in this pivotal trial. Furthermore, 
all potential subjects will be outside of the defined interval for inclusion at that time. 
7.7.9.2

Subjects Randomized to the L-BLP25 Arm

Subjects who are on active treatment with L-BLP25 at the time of unblinding of the trial will be 
offered further treatment and assessments as scheduled in case a potential benefit from further 
treatment is seen.
7.7.10

End of Study

Once  the  event-driven  unblinding  and  final  analysis  is  complete,  further  treatment  will  be 
provided as described in Section 7.7.9. All subjects still enrolled into the trial will be observed 
for disease progression and survival. Based on the additional data gained during the follow-up, 
the Sponsor will decide on the duration of the follow-up phase. Subjects still alive at the end of 
the follow-up phase will be eligible for the extension protocol.

The end of study is defined as the date that the last eligible subject is transferred to the extension 
protocol or continues L-BLP25 treatment in another appropriate setting.

Statistics

Statistical Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to compare survival duration of all randomized subjects in 
the primary analysis population by treatment arm.

Secondary objectives comprise the comparison of all randomized subjects in the primary analysis 
population  by  treatment arm  for  TTSP  as  measured  by  the  LCSS,  TTP  as  determined  by  the 
investigator, one-, two- and three-year survival and the safety profile. 

Two  formal  interim analyses  are  planned  occurring  after  observation  of  50%  and  75%  of  the 
planned  maximal  number  of  events in  the  primary  analysis  population,  respectively.  Final 
analysis  of  data  is  event  driven  and  is  expected  to  be  approximately  66 months  post  study 
initiation.
8.2

Target Variables

8.2.1

Primary Variable

The  primary  variable  of  this  study  is  the  survival  duration.  Survival  will  be  measured  as  the 
number  of  months  between  the  date  of  randomization  and  the  date  of  death.  For  subjects  not 
known to be deceased at time of analysis, the time between date of randomization and date of 
last contact or date lost to follow-up, will be calculated and used as a censored observation in the 
analysis.  For  subjects  randomized  but  not  treated,  survival  will  be  calculated  from  date  of 
randomization to date of death or last contact.

Survival will be analyzed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (primary analysis) and in the 
per protocol (PP) population but excluding all subjects randomized during the 6 months (= 26 
weeks) prior to the clinical hold in both analysis populations.
8.2.2

Secondary Variables

8.2.2.1

Time  to  Symptom  Progression  as  Measured  by  the  Lung 
Cancer Symptom Scale

TTSP will be defined as an increase (worsening) of the ASBI score of 10% of the scale breadth 
(10  mm  on  a  scale  of  0-100  mm)  from  the  baseline  score.  The  ASBI  is  the  mean  of  all  six 
symptom scores treated as a single item. Two consecutive measurements of the ASBI will be 
required,  each  one  being  10  mm  greater  than  baseline,  to  specify  a  score  of  having  truly 
worsened.  The  first  of  the  dates  from  the  two  consecutive  measures  will  be  considered  the 
progression date (see Section 8.4.3.1).

8.2.2.2

Time to Progression as Determined by the Investigator

In this trial disease progression will be determined by the investigator according to institutional 
standards.  TTP  will  be  measured  (in  months)  from  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of 
radiological confirmation of disease progression. 

In case where radiological confirmation cannot be obtained, the date the subject was withdrawn 
from treatment will be considered to be the date of progression.
8.2.2.3

One-, Two- and Three-Year Survival

One-, two- and three-year survival will be calculated on all randomized subjects and compared 
by treatment group. This variable will be analyzed in the primary analysis population based on 
the  ITT  but  excluding  all  subjects  randomized  during  the 6  months  (= 26  weeks)  prior  to  the 
clinical hold and in the PP population also excluding these subjects.
8.2.2.4

Safety Variables

Assessment of safety will include:
 ISRs (burning/stinging, pain, itching, erythema, induration, ulceration and other).
 AEs.
 Vital  signs  – body  temperature,  respiratory  rate,  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure,  will  be 

measured at the Pre-Treatment Evaluation visit and at the time of each treatment vaccination.

 Clinical 

laboratory  assessments  –

hematology  and  biochemistry 

(evaluations  at 
Pre-Treatment  Evaluation  visit,  weeks  4  and  8).  Subjects  who  continue  on  to  maintenance 
treatment  will  have  blood  drawn  for  hematology  and  biochemistry/transaminase/bilirubin 
assessments at  week  13  and  every  6  weeks  thereafter.  During  the  maintenance  treatment 
phase, transaminases/bilirubin assessments will be alternated with biochemistry assessments, 
which also include assessment of transaminases/bilirubin.

Further Variables of Interest

Progression Free Survival 

PFS will be measured from date of randomization to the date of tumor progression or death.
8.2.3.2

Healthcare Resource Utilization and Work Status

Healthcare resource utilization and work status data will also be collected and will include data 
on subject management, treatment patterns (during the study and during the [long-term] follow-
up), provided healthcare services, as well as duration and cause of being away from work.

Any health economics analyses will be considered exploratory.

Additional Quality of Life analyses utilizing the Lung Cancer 
Symptom Scale

Data  from  the  LCSS  assessments  (subject  scales)  will  be  analyzed  as  follows  to  determine 
differences in the treatment groups:
 The proportion of subjects with symptomatic progression will be determined.
 The area under the curve (AUC).
 TTSP for the individual symptoms scores (items 1-6 on the instrument).
 TTSP for the summary symptoms score (item 7 on the instrument).
 Time to worsening for global health related quality of life (HRQoL) (items 8 and 9 on the 

instrument).

8.2.3.4

Time to Treatment Failure

TTF will be measured from date of randomization to date of discontinuation of study treatment 
(L-BLP25  or  placebo)  for  any  reason  as  reported by  the  primary  physician.  For  subjects  still 
receiving treatment at the time of analysis, the time between date of randomization and the last 
date of vaccination will be used as a censored observation in the analysis. Subjects who have 
missed two consecutive scheduled doses will be considered as treatment failures and the TTF 
will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of their first missed vaccination. 

TTF data will be analyzed using the same analysis procedures used for the survival endpoint and 
will also focus on the primary analysis population.
8.2.3.5

HLA Typing

It  is  planned  to  perform  HLA  typing  for  class  I  and  II  alleles  on  all  randomized  subjects. 
Analysis of this data will be fully explorative.
8.2.3.6

Molecular Marker Analysis

If applicable, data from molecular marker analysis may be compared to clinical and QoL data in 
order to determine the relationship of molecular markers to the tumor’s response to treatment.
8.3

Analysis Populations

The  clinical  hold  led  to  a  stop  of  treatment,  enrollment, and randomization of  subjects.  Full 
global implementation of the clinical hold was completed on 23 March 2010. At that time, 1183 
subjects  were  randomized  and  553  subjects  (47%)  were  under  treatment,  whereas  all  other 
subjects were discontinued from treatment, mainly due to progression of disease.

The  first  6  months  of  treatment  including  the  primary  treatment  phase  of  eight weekly 
vaccinations  and  the  first  two  6-weekly  maintenance  vaccinations  are  believed  to  be  most 
essential in order to induce an immunotherapeutic effect, which could lead to the hypothesized 
overall survival duration prolongation under L-BLP25. 

Intention-to-Treat (ITT)

In general, all efficacy analyses will be based on an ITT approach. Consistent with this approach, 
all  subjects  who  are  randomized  will  be  included  in  the  efficacy  analyses.  Subjects  will  be 
included in the treatment arm to which they were randomized, regardless of treatment actually 
received. The ITT population forms the basis for the primary population for analysis and will 
also be considered for sensitivity analyses.

Primary analysis population based on the ITT

The primary analysis population will be based on the ITT population but prospectively exclude 
all subjects randomized during the 6 months (= 26 weeks) prior to the clinical hold. 

During the 6-month period from 22 September 2009 (including) to 22 March 2010 (including) 
prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  clinical  hold,  275  subjects  were  randomized  which  will  be 
excluded from all efficacy analyses based on the primary analysis population.

This population will be considered for the primary analysis and for decision making.

Per Protocol (PP)

The  PP  population  will  consist  of  subjects  without  major  protocol  violations.  This  population 
will  be identified  before  unblinding  the  study  database  and  will  be  used  to  test  primary  and 
secondary efficacy variables excluding HRQoL data. The stop of treatment due to the clinical 
hold is also considered as major protocol violation and analogue to the definition of the primary 
analysis population, all subjects randomized during the 6 months prior to the clinical hold will be 
excluded. This population will be considered a secondary population. 

Protocol violations will be defined prior to study initiation and the violators will be identified 
before unblinding the study database and presented in a data listing. 

Safety

The safety population includes all subjects who have taken at least one dose of study treatment 
(including cyclophosphamide/saline).

Populations used for sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of the clinical hold

As a consequence of the clinical hold, the primary analysis will focus on a subgroup of the ITT 
population  excluding  all  subjects  randomized  during  the  6  months  prior  to  the  clinical  hold. 
Although  the  primary  analysis  is  focused  on  this  subpopulation  of  the  ITT,  further  sensitivity 
analyses  will  be  conducted  to  assess  the  efficacy  in  the  overall  population  and  to  explore  the 
impact of the clinical hold.

Efficacy  will  be  explored  further  through  sensitivity  analyses  on  the  ITT  population  and 
subgroups of the ITT. These subgroups cover:
 All subjects randomized during the 6 months prior to the clinical hold who were excluded in 

the primary analysis population.

 All subjects not affected by the clinical hold, i.e., all subjects randomized and discontinued 
from treatment prior to the clinical hold or randomized after 14 June 2010, when the clinical 
hold was lifted. This subgroup will also exclude all subjects randomized during the 6 months 
prior to the clinical hold. 

Further details on sensitivity analyses will be defined in the statistical analysis plan of this study.

Description of Statistical Analyses

8.4.1

General Considerations

Data will be summarized by either enumeration of subjects displaying distinctive characteristics
within  each  treatment  group,  or  for  continuous  measures  by  descriptive  statistical  summaries 
such  as  number  of  subjects,  means,  standard  deviation,  medians,  and  ranges.    Inferential 
statistical  analyses  will  be  performed  for  variables  of  interest  using  the  proper  statistical 
hypothesis testing methods such as Cox-Regression, etc.. Ninety-five percent confidence interval 
will be created for primary and secondary analysis variables when applicable. Missing data will 
not  be  imputed  but  a  censoring  technique  will  be  utilized  for  analysis  of  incomplete  time 
dependent measures.
8.4.2

Primary Analysis

Survival duration will be measured as the number of months between the date of randomization 
and the date of death. For subjects alive or lost to follow-up at time of analysis, the time between 
date of randomization and the date on which the subject was last known alive will be calculated 
and used as a censored observation in the analysis. An ardent and continuous effort will be made 
to obtain survival information for subjects deemed as lost to follow-up. For subjects randomized 
but not treated, survival will be calculated from date of randomization to the date of death or last 
contact.  The  analysis  will  be  performed  on  the  basis  of  the  intention-to-treat  principle and 
exclude all subjects randomized during the 6 months prior to the clinical hold.

All subjects will be followed for survival (date  of death or date last known alive)  at 12 week 
intervals  until  death  or  study  completion.  Survival  will  be  monitored  until  705 events are 
observed in the primary analysis population (approximately 66 months after the start of subject 
accrual).

The  primary  analysis  of  the  efficacy  variable,  survival  duration,  will  be  a  Cox  proportional 
hazards regression model adjusted for fixed covariates measuring the four variables used in the 
stratification  for  disease  stage  (stage  IIIA  or  IIIB),  response  to  primary  chemo-radiotherapy 
(stable  disease  or  objective  response),  type  of  primary  chemo-radiotherapy  (concomitant  or

group sequential stopping rule described in the DMC Analysis Plan. The estimate of treatment 
effect will be the bias adjusted mean (48), with p value and 95% confidence interval computed 
using the ordering based on the estimate (49, 50). The p value, estimate, and confidence interval 
adjusted for the stopping rule will be computed using S+SeqTrial. 

As a secondary analysis, a test for a treatment difference in survival duration will be based on the 
estimated  hazard  ratio  from  a  proportional  hazards  model  in  which  the  only  covariate  is  the 
indicator of treatment, Armcd. Inference for this model will again be adjusted for the stopping 
rule using the bias adjusted estimate and the p value and confidence interval computed using the 
ordering based on the estimate.

Sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate the potential for randomization imbalances to 
affect the statistical inference on the primary endpoint of overall survival as well as the potential 
for  additional  precision  through  the  adjustment  of  important  explanatory  variables.  Additional 
covariates considered in such exploratory models are gender, serum LDH, and serum albumin 
measured as baseline (modeled as fixed covariates). These additional covariates will be added 
singly  in  four  separate  models  and  jointly  (all  four  additional  variables)  to  the  proportional

Secondary Analyses

The secondary efficacy analyses considered below are used only as supporting evidence for an 
effect  of  L-BLP25  on  the  primary  endpoint  of  overall  survival.  Therefore,  no  adjustment  for 
multiple comparisons across these secondary analyses will be made. Only the analyses of TTSP 
and  TTP  will  be  adjusted  for  potential  bias  introduced  by  their  correlation  with  the  primary 
endpoint of overall survival, which is sampled using a group sequential stopping rule (51). 
8.4.3.1

Time  to  Symptom  Progression  as  Measured  by  the  Lung 
Cancer Symptom Scale

The LCSS is a disease- and site-specific (site of the primary cancer) HRQoL questionnaire for 
individuals with lung cancer (52). This validated tool will be completed by the trial subjects at 
the Pre-Treatment visit (baseline), study week 2, week 5 and week 8 of the primary vaccination 
period. Following the primary vaccination period the LCSS tool will be applied every six weeks 
while the subject is on treatment. Once taken off treatment, the LCSS will be administered in the 
clinic at 6 weeks and 12 weeks post trial discontinuation. After this time, telephone reminders by 
the investigator or designee to the subject to complete and mail the LCSS form will occur every 
12 weeks until study end or death (subject scale only). 

If 3 or more items of the subject-scale are missing, the subject will be considered non-evaluable 
at that time point. For each symptom score the distance from the left boundary to the point where 
the subject has marked the line is measured in millimeters. The total scale length is 100 mm.

While subjects are on study treatment and until 12 weeks following the discontinuation of study 
treatment (i.e. last vaccination), an increase in the ASBI of 10% of the scale breadth (10 mm) 
from  the  pretreatment  baseline  found  on  each  of  at  least  two  consecutive  assessments  will  be 
deemed as a clinically meaningful symptomatic progression (53-55). When the ASBI is being 
determined  every  12  weeks,  an  increase  in  the  ASBI  lasting  for  only  one  assessment  will  be 
deemed as a clinically meaningful symptom progression.  The TTSP will be calculated from the 
date  of  randomization  to  the  first  of  the  dates  from  the  two  consecutive  measures  showing 
progression  (an  increase)  in  ASBI  scores.  TTSP  will  be  calculated  to  the  date  of  death  for 
subjects first diagnosed with disease progression at the time of death.

For subjects without clinically meaningful symptom progression still receiving treatment at the 
time  of  analysis,  the  date  of  the  last  assessment  will  be  used  to  calculate  TTSP  and  will  be 
considered as a censored observation in the analysis. Subjects who have stopped study treatment 
and  who  have  not  subsequently  met  the  criteria  for  TTSP  will  be  treated  as  censored 
observations at time of last follow-up LCSS assessment. Subjects dying from other causes and 
who  do  not  have  clinically  meaningful  symptom  progression  will  be  treated  as  censored 
observations at time of death.

Subjects who have missed two consecutive scheduled doses, without evaluable assessment for 
the  related  visits  and  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  thereafter  will  be  considered  as  having 
clinically meaningful symptomatic progression. In that case TTSP will be calculated from the 
date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  their  first missed  vaccination.  In the event that  a subject 
experiences a 10 mm increase in ASBI scores (worsening of symptoms) and has not completed a 
subsequent HRQoL questionnaire, the date of the 10 mm increase in the score will be considered 
as the time of the symptomatic progression.

The  analysis  of  TTSP,  to  examine  a  potential  clinically  meaningful  delay  in  symptomatic 
progression, will be based on proportional hazards analyses analogous to those used for overall 
survival. Because of the expected high correlation between TTSP and overall survival, the use of 
a stopping rule for the primary endpoint will tend to introduce some bias into the estimation of 
the hazard ratio for TTSP. A conservative approach will be used in which all inference for TTSP 
is adjusted for the stopping rule used for the overall survival endpoint using the same methods as 
described for the primary endpoint.
8.4.3.2

Time to Progression as Determined by the Investigator

TTP  will  be measured  from  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  radiological  confirmation  of 
disease progression. In the event that radiological confirmation cannot be obtained but subject is 
withdrawn  from  study  treatment  due  to  disease  progression  (i.e.  clinical  progression  without 
radiological  confirmation)  TTP  will  be  measured  from  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of 
discontinuation of study treatment.  

Subjects without disease progression at the time of the analysis will be censored at time of last 
contact.

Subjects  dying  from  causes  other  than  disease  progression  will  be  treated  as  censored 
observations at time of death.

Subjects who have missed two consecutive scheduled doses, without evaluable assessment for 
the related visits and who were lost to follow-up thereafter will be considered as having disease 
progression and the TTP will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of their 
first missed vaccination.

The analysis of TTP will be based on proportional hazards analyses analogous to those used for 
overall survival. Because of the expected high correlation between TTP and overall survival, the 
use  of  a  stopping  rule  for  the  primary  endpoint  will  tend  to  introduce  some  bias  into  the 
estimation  of  the  hazard  ratio  for  TTP.  A  conservative  approach  will  be  used  in  which  all 
inference for TTP is adjusted for the stopping rule used for the overall survival endpoint using 
the same methods as described for the primary endpoint.

One-, Two- and Three-Year Survival

This secondary endpoint will be assessed by comparing the study arms for survival at one, two

Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Variable

Of special interest are the subgroup analyses on gender and HLA subtype analysis.

Gender analysis

An analysis of survival by treatment group will be conducted by gender type. Based on data from 
the B25-LG-304 clinical trial, as well as outcomes recently identified in the literature, there is 
some rationale to hypothesize that women may have a better survival outcome than men in an 
immunology clinical trial (56-58). Survival by gender will be calculated using the same analysis 
procedures used for the survival endpoint

HLA subtype analysis

An analysis of survival by treatment group will be conducted by HLA subtype. Based on data 
from the B25-LG-304 clinical trial, there is some rationale to hypothesize that individuals with 
certain  HLA  subtypes  (A-2  for  instance)  may  experience  different  survival  outcomes  in  an 
immunology clinical trial. Associations of survival by HLA subtype, and A-2 in particular, will 
be calculated using the same analysis procedures used for the survival endpoint.

Further  subgroup  analyses  will  be  conducted  by  stage  of  disease  at  diagnosis,  response  to 
primary  chemo-radiotherapy, 
type  of  primary  chemo-radiotherapy  (concomitant  versus 
sequential),  geographic  region,  serum  LDH  (abnormal  versus  normal),  and  serum  albumin 
(abnormal versus normal).
8.4.3.5

Safety Analyses

All safety data will be displayed in subject data listings and summarized in tables. In the listings 
and summaries, subjects will be included in the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
Summary tables will display the total number of AEs and the number of subjects with each AE.

AEs with unknown onset dates will be counted as post-vaccination administration adverse events 
provided it is noted as post-injection on the CRF. AEs with a missing relationship to study drug 
will be included in the summary of AEs related to study drug. AEs with missing severity grades 
will be categorised as “missing” for tabulation of AEs by toxicity grades.

Analysis of Further Variables

The variables considered in this section will be analyzed using the primary analysis population.
Further  sensitivity  analyses  exploring  the  impact  of  the  clinical  hold  will be  defined  in  the 
statistical analysis plan of this study.
8.4.4.1

Progression Free Survival

PFS will be measured from date of randomization to the date of objective tumor progression or 
death. For subjects not determined to have tumor progression or who are not deceased, the PFS 
will be censored at date of last contact. PFS will be analyzed using the same method as TTF.

Quality of Life Index (EQ-5D)

The EQ-5D questionnaire (APPENDIX F) is a generic measure of health status that provides a 
simple descriptive profile and a simple index value that can be used in the clinical evaluation of 
health  care.  The  EQ-5D  defines  health  in  terms  of  mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. In addition a visual analogue scale is used to describe 
the subjects’ health state on the day of assessment (46, 47).

The EQ-5D questionnaire will be completed at the Pre-Treatment Evaluation visit, weeks 2, 5, 
week  8  and  thereafter  every  6  weeks  commencing  at  week  13  and  continuing  till  the  End  of 
Treatment visit. At 6 and 12 weeks following the discontinuation of study treatment, the EQ-5D 
will  be  administered  by  the  investigator  or  designee  during  the  follow-up  visits.  The 
questionnaire will be handed to the subject and should be completed at the investigational site 
prior to the initiation of any other study activities or treatments (including laboratory draws and 
study treatment administration) and prior to any  contact with the investigator. After this time, 
telephone reminders by  the investigator or  a designee to the subject to complete and mail the 
questionnaire will occur every 12 weeks until study end or death.
8.4.4.3

Additional  Quality  of  Life  Analyses  Utilizing  the  Lung 
Cancer Symptom Scale

Data from the LCSS assessments (subject scales) will be analyzed to determine differences in the 
treatment groups. The following hypotheses will be tested:
 At the final analysis, the proportion of subjects receiving L-BLP25 who have experienced a 
clinically meaningful symptom progression (an increase [worsening] in the ASBI as defined 
in Section 8.4.3.1) will be lower compared to those receiving placebo. 

 AUC analyses will demonstrate a benefit towards subjects receiving L-BLP25 compared to 

those receiving placebo.

 Individual  symptom  scores  (items  #1-6  on 

instrument)  for  subjects  receiving 
L-BLP25  will  be  compared  to  those  receiving  placebo  using  Cox  regression.  The  time  to 
worsening (defined as a 10 mm increase in an individual score observed over two consecutive 
measures with the first measure denoting TTSP for that symptom) will be longer for subjects 
receiving L-BLP25 compared to those receiving placebo.

the 

 The  summary  symptom  score  (item  #7  of  the  LCSS  instrument)  for  subjects  receiving  L-
BLP25  will  be  compared  to  those  receiving  placebo  using  Cox  regression.  The  time  to

consecutive  measures  with  the  first  measure  denoting  TTSP  for  this  cumulative  symptom 
summary item) will be longer for subjects receiving  L-BLP25 compared to those receiving 
placebo.

QoL/HRQoL) for subjects receiving L-BLP25 will be compared to those receiving placebo 
using Cox regression. The time to worsening (defined as a 10 mm increase in average HRQoL

combined average score of LCSS items #8 and #9) will be longer for subjects receiving L-
BLP25 compared to those receiving placebo.

8.4.4.4

Time to Treatment Failure

TTF will be measured from date of randomization to date of discontinuation of study treatment 
(L-BLP25  or  placebo)  for  any  reason  as  reported  by  the  primary  physician.  For  subjects  still 
receiving treatment at the time of analysis, the time between date of randomization and the last 
date of vaccination will be used as a censored observation in the analysis. Subjects who have 
missed two consecutive scheduled doses will be considered as treatment failures and the TTF 
will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of their first missed vaccination. 

The analysis of TTF will be based on proportional hazards analyses analogous to those used for 
overall survival.
8.5

Interim Analysis

An independent DMC will be formed from a group of four experts and will consist of at least a 
statistician and one oncologist who will not be either a participant in the trial or an employee of 
the Sponsor of this study as well as an unblinded statistician who is not a voting member of the 
DMC. A DMC charter and DMC Analysis Plan will provide the details about the conduct of the 
DMC meeting and decision making rules. 

The DMC will be responsible for periodic evaluations of the clinical trial to ensure continued 
subject  safety  as  well  as  the  validity  and  scientific  merit  of  the  study.  In  addition  to  periodic 
evaluations  and  a  final  analysis,  two  formal  interim  analyses  are  planned,  occurring  after 
observation of 50% and 75% of the planned maximal number of events in the primary analysis 
population,  respectively.  Final  analysis  of  data  is  event  driven  and  is  expected  to  be 
approximately 66 months post study initiation.

The  designated  unblinded  statistician  will  provide  the  DMC  with  the  safety  summaries 
periodically for review. At the time of the interim analyses, the unblinded statistician will have 
access to the subject treatment assignments. If the Sponsor decides to file for registration based 
on  the  results  of  the  interim  analysis,  representatives  from  the  clinical  and  regulatory 
departments  would  also  be  unblinded,  on  a  need  to  know  basis.  However,  no  individuals 
involved  with  the  direct  monitoring  of  the  trial  will  have  access  to  the  treatment  identities 
(except  for  an  unblinded  study  monitor  to  monitor  cyclophosphamide  and  saline  drug 
accountability records). Access to an individual subject’s study arm status may be provided to 
the investigator in case of a medical emergency (see Section 6.3.2).
8.6

Sample Size

Due  to  the  clinical  hold,  the  primary  analysis  of  this  study  will  focus  on  the  ITT  population 
excluding all subjects randomized during the 6 months prior to the clinical hold. All assumptions 
as stated for the initial planning of this study will stay the same but focus on the primary analysis 
population.

START

The following assumptions were made in the initial sample size and power calculations in the 
group  sequential  design  to  compare  the  two  study  arms  for  the  primary  outcome  of  overall 
survival:
 Hazard ratio = 0.77.
 2:1 randomization.
 Alpha = 0.025 (1-sided).
 Power = 90%.
 Two  formal  interim  analyses  occurring  after  observation  of  50%  and  75%  of  the  planned 

maximal number of events in the primary analysis population.

 An  efficacy  boundary  that  allows  early  stopping  consistent  with  a  one-sided  level  0.001 

O’Brien-Fleming design.

 A futility boundary that allows early stopping consistent with the futility boundary of a one-
sided  level  0.025  symmetric  group  sequential  design  with  O’Brien-Fleming  boundary 
relationships.

Under these assumptions, follow-up will be event driven in order to observe a maximum of 705 
events (deaths) in the primary analysis population excluding subjects randomized during the 6 
months prior to the clinical hold. There will be no change in the total number of events necessary 
for final analysis compared to the initial planning of this study.

An adjustment of sample size will, however, be made due to the exclusion of the 275 subjects 
randomized during the 6 months prior to the clinical hold. All of these subjects will be replaced. 
As  a  consequence, the  accrual  period  and  follow-up  period  will  be  extended  so  that  fewer
subjects compared to the initial planning will be necessary to observe the anticipated number of 
events in a reasonable period of time. 

For  the  adjustment  of  sample  size  for  the  primary  analysis  population,  past  observed  accrual 
rates  (smoothed  by  a  3-month  moving  average)  together  with  projected  rates  were  considered 
(see  Table  13).  The  past  accrual  rates  already  exclude  all  subjects  randomized  during  the  6 
months  prior  to  the  clinical  hold.  Future  recruitment  is  believed  to  continue  with  a  monthly 
accrual rate of 20 subjects for the first 6 months after the clinical hold, starting with September 
2010, and a rate of 30 subjects per month until the end of the trial. 

Under these assumptions and a median survival of 20 months in the placebo arm together with an 
estimated  exponential  lost  to  follow-up  rate  of  0.005,  a  sample  size  of  1200  subjects  in  the 
primary  analysis  population  (800  subjects  on  the  investigational  arm  and  400  subjects  on 
placebo)  would  project  a  final  analysis  at  approximately  66  months  post  study  initiation. 
According to simulation studies with EAST 5.1, this lost to follow-up rate will lead to a rate of 
about 11% at the time of final analysis. 

Overall,  an  estimated  number  of  1476  subjects  (= 1200 + 275 + 1,  allowing  for  one  additional 
subject to ensure the possibility for a 2:1 randomization with 984 subjects on the investigational 
arm and 492 subjects on the placebo arm) will be enrolled.

Ethical and Regulatory Aspects

Responsibilities of the Investigator

The investigator shall be responsible for ensuring that the clinical study is performed in accord-
ance with the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki 
as well as with the International Committee of Harmonization (ICH) Note for Guidance on Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) (ICH, Topic E6, 1995) and applicable regulatory  requirements. These 
documents  state  that  the  informed  consent  of  subjects  is  an  essential  precondition  for 
participation in the clinical study.

In  1998,  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  introduced  a  regulation  (21  Code  of 
Federal Regulation [CFR], Part 54) entitled “Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators”. For 
studies  conducted  in  any  country  that  could  result  in  a  product  submission  to  the  FDA  for 
marketing  approval  and  which  contribute  significantly  to  the  demonstration  of  efficacy  and 
safety  of  the  drug  (named  “covered  studies”  by  the  FDA),  the  investigator  and  all  sub-
investigators  are  obliged  to  disclose  their  financial  interest  which  they  or  their  spouses  and 
dependant children may have in the Sponsor. This information is required during the study and 
until 12 months after its completion.
9.2

Subject Information

An unconditional prerequisite for a subject participating in the study is his/her written informed 
consent. Adequate information must therefore be given to the subject by the investigator before 
informed consent is obtained. A person designated by the investigator may give the information, 
if permitted by local regulations. A patient information sheet in the local language and prepared 
in accordance with the Note for Guidance on GCP (ICH, Topic E6, 1995) will be provided by 
the  Sponsor  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  informed  consent.  In  addition  to  this  written 
information, the investigator or his designate will inform the subject verbally. In doing so, the 
wording  used  will  be  chosen  so  that  the  information  can  be  fully  and  readily  understood  by 
laypersons. 

The  patient  information  sheet  will  be  revised  whenever  important  new  information  becomes 
available that may be relevant to the consent of subjects.
9.3

Subject Consent

The written informed consent of the subject to participate in the clinical study has to be given 
before any study-related activities are carried out. It must be signed and personally dated by the 
subject  and  by  the  investigator,  or  by  a  person  designated  by  the  investigator  to  conduct  the 
informed consent discussion (if permitted by local regulations). 

The Informed Consent Form (ICF) will explain to potential subjects the nature of this study and 
its purposes, risks and duration. Subjects will be advised whom to contact for advice regarding 
the study, and what to do in the event of an AE during the trial. The ICF will state that scientific

the 

Provision  of  consent  will  be  confirmed  in  the  CRF  by  the  investigator.  The  signed  and  dated 
declaration of informed consent will remain at the investigator's site and must be safely archived 
by the investigator so that the forms can be retrieved at any time for monitoring, auditing and 
inspection purposes. A copy of the signed and dated information and consent should be provided 
to  the  subject  prior  to  participation.  Documentation  of  subject’s  receipt  of  the  copy  of  the 
informed consent form is to be entered in the subject’s medical record.
9.4

Compensation to Subjects

Insurance  coverage  shall  be  provided  for  all  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study  from  the  time  of 
subject’s inclusion into the study (i.e. date of written informed consent). Appropriate insurance 
coverage is provided by the Sponsor in line with legal requirements and GCP guidance and in 
accordance with the (local) regulations of each individual country. Different insurance providers 
might  have  to  be  used  in  accordance  with  local  regulations  or  service/availability.  A 
confirmation  of  insurance  and  corresponding  insurance  conditions  should  be  archived  in  the 
Investigator Site File (ISF).

The Sponsor shall, to the extent not covered by the subject’s medical and/or hospital insurance or 
third  party  or  governmental  programs  (except  in  the  US  where  governmental  programs  are 
excepted out, as the government is the payer of last resort in the US) providing such coverage, 
reimburse the subject or the institution providing medical care and services for the cost of all 
immediate medical care and services to any subject participating in the study for physical injuries 
arising  out  of  (i)  the  administration  of  the  study  drug  pursuant  to  the  protocol,  or  (ii)  the 
performance  of  any  procedure  called  for  and  administered  pursuant  to  the  protocol.  No  other 
compensation  (such  as  lost  wages  or  payment  for  emotional  distress)  will  be  provided  by  the 
Sponsor.
9.5

Independent  Ethics  Committee  or  Institutional  Review

Prior  to  commencement  of  the  study,  the  study  protocol  will  be  submitted  together  with  its 
associated  documents  (patient  information  sheet,  ICF,  current  IB,  etc.)
to  the  relevant 
Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IEC)  /  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  for their  favorable 
opinion/approval.  Written  re-approval  must  be  obtained  at  intervals  not  to  exceed  1  year,  if 
applicable. The favorable opinion/approval of the relevant IEC/IRB will be filed in the ISF and a 
copy in the Study Master File (SMF) at Sponsor.

Study Management

Case Report Form Handling

Subject data will be recorded in the CRF. The main objective is to obtain those data required by 
the  study  protocol  in  a  complete,  accurate,  legible  and  timely  fashion.  The  data  in  the  CRF 
should be consistent with the relevant source documents.

The data recorded in the course of this study must be documented in the CRFs and/or the ARF 
and  must  be  forwarded  to  the  Sponsor  or  a  designated  CRO.  They  shall  then  be  processed, 
evaluated, and stored in anonymous form in accordance with the data-protection regulations. 

The investigator must ensure that the CRFs forwarded to the Sponsor or a designated CRO and 
any other associated documents contain no mention of any subject names.

The CRFs are to be reviewed by the investigator for completeness and accuracy. Each subject's 
CRF must be signed by the investigator to document correctness and accuracy of data contained 
within.

The CRFs must be filled in completely and legibly (with black ballpoint pen, acceptable for use 
on  official  documents).  Any  amendments  and  corrections  necessary  must  be  undertaken  and 
countersigned  by  the  investigator,  stating  the  date  of  the  amendment/  correction.  Errors  must 
remain  legible  and  may  not  be  deleted  with  correction  aids  (e.g.  Tipp-Ex).  The  investigator 
must state his/her reasons for the correction of important data.

In  the  case  of  missing  data/remarks,  the  entry  spaces  provided  for  in  the  CRF  should be 
cancelled out so as to avoid unnecessary follow-up inquiries.

Further details on CRF completion and handling are given in the MOP.

The CRFs are regulatory documents and must be suitable for submission to authorities.
10.2

Source Data and Subject Files

The investigator has to keep a written or electronic subject file for every subject participating in 
the clinical study. In this subject file, the available demographic and medical information of a 
subject  has  to  be  documented,  in  particular  the  following:  name,  date  of  birth,  sex,  height, 
weight, subject history, concomitant diseases and concomitant drugs (including changes during 
the study), statement of entry into the study, study identification number, subject identification 
number, the date of informed consent, all study visit dates, predefined performed examinations 
and clinical findings, observed AEs, and reason for withdrawal from the study, if applicable. It 
should be possible to verify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study from the available 
data in this file.

START

It must be possible to identify each subject by using this subject file. 

Documents  related  to  the  clinical  trial,  including  original  subject  medical  records,  must  be 
retained by the investigator/institution to satisfy regulatory requirements.

Additionally,  any  other  documents  with  source  data,  especially  original  printouts  of  data  that 
were generated by technical equipment have to be filed. This includes but is not limited to ECG 
recordings and print-outs of imaging studies (e.g. CT- or MRI-scans). All these documents have 
to bear at least the subject identification and the printing date printed by the recording device to 
indicate  to  which  subject  and  to  which  study  procedure  the  document  belongs.  The  medical 
evaluation  of  such  records  should  be  documented  as  necessary  and  signed/dated  by  the 
investigator.

Computerized subject files will be printed whenever source data verification is performed by the 
monitor. Printouts must be signed and dated by the investigator, countersigned by the monitor 
and kept in a safe place. 

All data recorded on the CRF must also form part of the subject’s source data.
10.3

Investigator Site File and Archiving

The investigator will be provided with an Investigator Site File (ISF) at the start of the study. 
This file contains all relevant documents necessary for the conduct of the study. This file must be 
safely archived after termination of the study.

It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the subject identification sheets are stored 
for at least 15 years beyond the end of the clinical study. All original subject files must be stored 
for the longest possible time permitted by the regulations at the hospital, research institute, or 
practice in question. If archiving can no longer be maintained at the site, the investigator will 
notify the Sponsor.

Inspection  by 

Monitoring,  Quality  Assurance  and 
Authorities

This  study  is  to  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  Note  for  Guidance  on  GCP  (ICH, 
Topic E6, 1995). The appointed monitor will arrange regular visits to the trial center(s) every 12 
weeks to check progress with the study and to collect completed CRFs. 

During monitoring visits, the monitors will:
 help resolve any problems,
 examine all CRFs for omission of data, compliance and possible AEs,
 discuss inconsistencies in the trial data,
 ensure that all trial materials are correctly stored and dispensed,
 check adherence to the obligations of the investigator,

 review ICFs, in particular the date of consent and signature,
 perform source data verification as described below.

A  separate  unblinded  monitoring  team  will  make  special  visits  to  monitor  and  reconcile  drug 
accountability for cyclophosphamide.

In line with ICH GCP guidelines, monitoring will include verification of data entered in the CRF 
against  original  subject  records.  This  verification  will  be  performed  by  direct  access  to  the 
original subject records, and the Sponsor guarantees that subject confidentiality will be respected 
at all times. Participation in this study will be taken as agreement to permit direct source data 
verification. 

In  addition,  the  representatives  of  the  Development  Quality  Assurance  (DQA)  department  at 
Sponsor,  their  appointed  monitoring  organizations,  and  international  regulatory  authorities  are 
permitted  to  inspect  the  study  documents  (study  protocol,  CRFs,  study  drug,  original  medical 
records/files). All subject data shall be treated confidentially.

In the course of the clinical study, the CRFs shall be forwarded to a designated representative of 
the Sponsor after completion of the individual sections (e.g. visits) of the study.

The study protocol, each step of the data-recording procedure, and the handling of the data as 
well  as  the  study  report  may be  subject  to  an  independent  audit  by  DQA.  Audits  can  be 
conducted to assure the validity of the study data.

By  signing  this  protocol,  the  investigator  agrees  that  within  local  regulatory  restrictions  and 
institutional and ethical considerations, the Sponsor may consult and/or copy data from source 
documents  (e.g.  nuclear  medicine  reports,  laboratory  reports,  ECG,  CT- or  MRI-scans, 
workbooks and subject’s medical records) in a form that preserves subject’s confidentiality in 
order to verify CRF data.

By  signing  this  protocol,  the  investigator  affirms  to  the  Sponsor  or  its  delegate(s)  that 
information  furnished  by  the  Sponsor  will  be  maintained  in  confidence,  and  such  information 
will be divulged to the IEC/IRB under an appropriate understanding of confidentiality with such 
a committee. The investigator must not reveal information relating to the IB, protocol, CRFs, or 
associated documents to third parties (except authorized study staff) without express permission 
of the Sponsor or its delegate(s).

If a written agreement for the conduct of the study, which includes ownership or confidentiality 
provisions  inconsistent  with  this  statement,  is  executed,  that  agreement’s  ownership  and 
confidentiality provisions shall override those in the protocol.

Major changes to the protocol will be described in a "Protocol Amendment". It will be submitted 
to  the  relevant  IEC(s)/IRB(s)  and  to  authorities,  where  required.  Approval/favorable  opinion 
from the relevant IEC(s/IRB(s) will be required prior to implementation of the amendment.

Any  amendment  affecting  the  subject,  requires  the  subject's  informed  consent  prior  to 
implementation.

Changes  of  administrative  or  technical  nature  will  be  recorded  in  a  document  entitled 
"Administrative  Change  to  Study  Protocol".  It  will  be  sent  for  information  to  the  relevant 
IEC(s)/IRB(s) or to authorities, if so required.

Amendments and Administrative Changes will be signed by all signatories of the protocol. All 
investigators will acknowledge the receipt and confirm by their signature on the Amendment or 
Administrative Change Signature Sheet that they will adhere to the Amendment/Administrative 
Change. This sheet will be issued in duplicate and after signing one will be filed in the ISF and 
one in the SMF.

Study Report and Publication Policy

After conclusion of the study, an integrated clinical and statistical study report shall be written by 
the Sponsor in consultation with the Coordinating Investigator. This report shall be based on the 
items listed in this study protocol. The first publication will be a full publication of all data from 
all  sites.  Any  publications  of  the  results,  either  in  part  or  in  total  (abstracts  in  journals  or 
newspapers,  oral  presentations,  etc.)  by  investigators  or  their  representatives  will  require  pre-
submission review by the Sponsor. The Sponsor is entitled to delay publication in order to obtain 
patent protection. 

The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship will be 
followed (59).

The  Coordinating  Investigator  as  well  as  the  other  members  of  the  Study  Committee  will  be 
authors  on  the  first  full  publication.  The  Coordinating  Investigator  will  have  the  choice  of 
authorship  position;  first  or  last.  The  remaining  position  will  be  assigned  to  one  of  the 
investigators  based  on  contribution  to  the  success  of  the  study  with  respect  to  recruitment, 
intellectual and administrative contribution. The remaining Study Committee members will be 
ranked according to the number of subjects randomized. Further co-authors will be participating 
investigators ranked after the Study Committee members based on contribution to the study with 
respect to recruitment, intellectual and administrative contribution. There is one author per site 
per publication.

A separate publication plan will be set up to describe further publications besides the first main 
publication.

* All Pre-Treatment Evaluation assessments must be performed within 2 weeks before randomization (with the exception of imaging, see below).
** Within 3 days of treatment assignment. 
*** To be performed 6 weeks after the last vaccination or before start of further anti-cancer treatment, whichever is first.
**** Only to be performed if the End of Treatment visit is performed earlier than 6 weeks after last vaccination (i.e. due to the start of further anti-cancer treatment).
***** The long-term follow-up visits should be performed every 12 weeks, commencing 12 weeks after the follow-up visit performed 12 weeks after the last

Physical examinations for neurological signs.
Additionally to be performed every 12 weeks thereafter.

Imaging  (CT-or  MRI- scan):  Response  to  primary  chemo-radiotherapy  (according  to  RECIST)  must  be  determined  within  4  weeks  (28  days)  prior  to 
randomization. If imaging after primary chemo-radiotherapy was earlier than 4 weeks prior to randomization, it must be repeated within 4 weeks prior to 
randomization, and the results of the second restaging after end of primary chemo-radiotherapy must be compared with the first restaging after end of 
primary  chemo-radiotherapy.  Subjects  that  show  progression  between  these  two  assessments  are  not  eligible  for  this  trial.  The  same  radiological 
evaluation methods used prior to primary chemo-radiotherapy should be used to evaluate the response with the exception that the PET-scan does not 
need to be repeated even if it was part of the initial radiological evaluation prior to primary chemo-radiotherapy.
Documentation of radiological progression of disease (according to RECIST), if applicable. 
Hematology / Biochemistry: Biochemistry includes transaminases and bilirubin. Samples need to be sent to a central lab. Subject eligibility will be 
determined based on local laboratory results.
Further pregnancy testing during the study has to be performed according to hospital standards and local regulations.
Subject scale and observer scale until 12 weeks after last vaccination. In the long-term follow-up subject scale only.
AEs that are considered to be possibly related to the study drug will be followed up until outcome is known. For subjects who are on placebo at the time of 
unblinding, AEs will be collected in 6-weekly intervals until disease progression.
At Pre-Treatment Evaluation: concomitant medication administered within 14 days before randomization.
Plasma and whole blood collection should be performed at visit 13 (i.e. week 19) or at the End of Treatment visit, whichever is first.
A brain scan is mandatory at the pre-treatment evaluation visit.

TNM CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION FOR LUNG CANCER

Stage

The  American  Joint  Committee  on  Cancer  (AJCC)  (48) has  designated  staging  by  TNM 
classification: Primary tumor (T), Regional Lymph Nodes (N), Distant Metastasis (M).

Primary Tumor (T)

TX:

T0:

Tis:

T1:

T2:

T3:

T4:

Primary tumor cannot be assessed, or tumor proven by the presence of malignant cells 
in sputum or bronchial washings but not visualized by imaging or bronchoscopy

No evidence of primary tumor

Carcinoma in situ

Tumor  that  is  3 cm  or  less  in  greatest  dimension,  surrounded  by  lung  or  visceral 
pleura,  without  bronchoscopic  evidence  of  invasion  more  proximal  than  the  lobar 
bronchus* (i.e., not in the main bronchus)

Tumor with any of the following features of size or extent:
o More than 3 cm in greatest dimension
o Involves the main bronchus, 2 cm or more distal to the carina
o Invades the visceral pleura
o Associated  with  atelectasis  or  obstructive  pneumonitis  that  extends  to  the  hilar 

region but does not involve the entire lung

Tumor of any size that directly invades any of the following: chest wall (including 
superior  sulcus  tumors),  diaphragm,  mediastinal  pleura,  parietal  pericardium;  or 
tumor  in  the  main  bronchus  less  than  2 cm  distal  to  the  carina  but  without 
involvement of the carina; or associated atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the 
entire lung

Tumor  of  any  size  that  invades  any  of  the  following:  mediastinum,  heart,  great 
vessels, trachea, esophagus, vertebral body, carina; or separate tumor nodules in the 
same lobe; or tumor with a malignant pleural effusion**

*Note:

The uncommon superficial tumor of any size with its invasive component limited to 
the  bronchial  wall,  which  may  extend  proximal  to  the  main  bronchus,  is  also 
classified as T1.

**Note: Most pleural effusions associated with lung cancer are due to tumor. However, there 
are a few subjects in whom multiple cytopathologic examinations of pleural fluid are 
negative for tumor. In these cases, fluid is non-bloody and is not an exudate. When 
these  elements  and  clinical  judgment  dictate  that  the  effusion  is  not  related  to  the

To help people say how good or bad a health state is, 
we have drawn a scale (rather like a thermometer) on 
which  the  best  state  you  can  imagine  is  marked  100 
and the worst state you can imagine is marked 0.

We would like you to indicate on this scale how good 
or  bad  your  own  health  is  today,  in  your  opinion. 
Please do this by drawing a line from the box below to 
whichever point on the scale indicates how good or bad 
your health state is today.
